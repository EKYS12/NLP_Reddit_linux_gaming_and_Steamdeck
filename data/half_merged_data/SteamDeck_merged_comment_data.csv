jh4mtoj,Oh man I feel it's gonna be a massive hit in Japan.,SteamDeck
jh4suou,"Good move (in my opinion) since I heard the console product are more popular than pc. And selling it in retail stores instead of a website could sell more

This might make a bunch of Japan devs work on steam deck, which means Linux support in general!!!",SteamDeck
jh4vbl7,"Wow! That's interesting. I hope it's a huge hit over there in Japan! Nice to see it hit retail over there.

I know in USA we can buy it from Steam directly - but is Steam Deck going to hit retail stores like Best Buy, WalMart, Amazon, and other retailers too?",SteamDeck
jh4t26g,"I know this has been said before, but what did Australia do to make Valve this cold?",SteamDeck
jh5281g,Japan is already the only country where i saw people in the wild with the steamdeck. And i can be spotted often as well taking rides with the deck in train.,SteamDeck
jh4z8kh,Next Monster Hunter is gonna be Steam Deck verified for sure,SteamDeck
jh4vgle,"This is great. This needs to happen in all current  regions, too. As it being only on Steam is what's holding the Steam Deck back.",SteamDeck
jh4vw9l,I wonder which store they'll bring the Steam Deck in South Korea?,SteamDeck
jh4w1ga,"As a historical and cultural point of reference, Japanese consumers tend to be very picky about their consoles and pretty much rejected Xbox as a platform to stick with homegrown favorites from Sony and Nintendo.  

While I hope the deck is a big hit there, I kinda doubt it’ll make a big splash.",SteamDeck
jh564o5,"I am so glad the Deck is releasing to more and more countries. Valve has finally released hardware that is a hit and I am excited to see what they have in store for us in the future. Steam Deck and Switch combo gives me such a wide variety of games to choose from, I still feel like I don't need a PS5.",SteamDeck
jh4yzq3,My local gaming store is having tons of Steam Deck for sale and this country is not even in the official country list. >!Malaysia!<,SteamDeck
jh5g7ms,"Steam Deck is the perfect portable device for retro-gaming, which Japanese people absolutely love. I hope they will be willing to make the transition from operating several handhelds to, well, 1. I hope the sale numbers are about to go way, way up.",SteamDeck
jh5r8wz,"This is it. SD might start selling like mad,  and if it does JP gaming companies likely will start optimizing their games for SD in mind, and maybe even start porting more remasteref versions of older console games.",SteamDeck
jh58ie3,I hope they do the same in America!,SteamDeck
jh56ojp,Just on time for TotK,SteamDeck
jh5dtud,Do we know how japanese gamers reacted to the Stem Deck ?,SteamDeck
jh55e7f,"Whoa, this is absolutely wild since I’ve been really interested in picking one up, but living in Japan has made that pretty inconvenient. Looks like if I’m lucky
I can just stumble into one now. Haha",SteamDeck
jh5lutw,Do you guys think It will eventually come to retail stores in Europe?,SteamDeck
jh5ce8q,How about releasing it in other countries? I have been waiting for over a year now.,SteamDeck
jh4xjyb,"That's a war announcement to Nintendo!

But that's great news. The Nintendo Switch is a completely oudated tablet with a horrendous and overpriced e-store.

Up until this day I am still pissed that I had to play Hyrule Warriors 2 with 9 FPS. I am glad that I dodged the bullet and didn't play any of the latest Pokemon titles, looking at the reports, the performance was horrendous. Nintendo being greedy cheapskates (laughable sales, bad hardware that remains fully priced even after being oudated for more than 5 years already) has completely ruined a lot of titles that I was excited for. 

It's about some time for Nintendo to get competition. They have to get their shit together and focus on producing quality products instead of witchhunting youtubers.",SteamDeck
jh5o6j6,North Korea when?,SteamDeck
jh5q0er,"How about everywhere else too? The Steam Deck could do much better if you could actually get it from Amazon, etc; IMO.",SteamDeck
jh5gd19,if valve can get the steam deck in walmart and best buy stores with kiosk displays around the world it will be a game changer.  pun intended.  if i were in charge of marketing i'd do everything possible to hire kevin butler to do the advertisements.,SteamDeck
jh57fje,"Its funny Nintendo has tried to sue valve several tines now and valves lawyers have been basically like ""lol ok"" and ignored them.",SteamDeck
jh5e5hr,If everything goes right then maybe there will be steam decks in America in the future as well?,SteamDeck
jh6jgfp,I should really take mine out the box.. I've had it like 7 months now 🙃,SteamDeck
jh4wedx,"And Going To Japan Is A HUGE Success, Valve Will BOOM Quick There! Although The Japanese Hated The Original Xbox Bc It Was Too Big, Bc It Was Designed For Bigger Hands In America, While From What I've Been Told Japanese Men Have Much Smaller Scale Of Palms Then Guys In America. Go Figure.",SteamDeck
jh59scy,"Them japanese folk about to get turnt up dude imagine hearing about this all this time and not being able to get it 

And now imagine its Japan",SteamDeck
jh5ddjs,"I feel like Valve really need to ramp up compatibility for old jist software on proton. i tried a bunch of doujinsoft and VNs (eroges included) and barely managed to run like 2 out of 15.

Specially if they want it to be viable on Japan aside of Steam.",SteamDeck
jh5fwwh,India? Anytime soon?,SteamDeck
jh5nltt,"I got mine a couple of days ago from a retail store in Switzerland. I was so happy when I see that they are becoming available here, I ordered one right away.",SteamDeck
jh5v1i6,Curious if we'll start seeing flatpaks for Japanese game stores and services.,SteamDeck
jh5yqgj,"Good.  If this were to release in the US, valve won't make profits due to the high crime rate in stores.",SteamDeck
jh5ywgh,"I brought an Atari Lynx over to Japan in 1991 or so, and stayed with a family that was friends with my Dad.  They had three sons all around my age, and a famicom and a Super Famicom.  All they wanted to do was play with my Lynx.  We went to Akihabara one afternoon, and they had imported Lynxs for sale for like 3x the sticker price in US.  People were mad for them from what I could tell.  Don't under estimate the power of western hardware appeal!  I hope it explodes overseas and we get a lot of fun new Japanese and Korean innovation and community members!",SteamDeck
jh655cp,"It seems so bizarre they aren't sold outside the USA. I would buy one in Australia. I get Valve wanting all the profits, but then just sell only through your own website and not put them in retail or Amazon if that is the issue. Gatekeeping them is just strange; I hear almost nothing about these things locally yet they are often on US sites being discussed. Few here even know they are released I have noticed! Heck, I thought they were still in development for a year at least after they came out.",SteamDeck
jh65boa,So it might will be in weekly Famitsu sales chart.,SteamDeck
jh6chuq,"In second hand, the 256 + sd 512 version for 350€ is it a good deal or not?",SteamDeck
jh6qky0,"Oh hey, that's my birthday! I already have a Steam Deck and I don't live in Japan though.",SteamDeck
jh4rhic,Waiting for the Steamgrids from japananese people,SteamDeck
jh4rgin,I hope so,SteamDeck
jh5zwbz,"It’s a pain to change system locale to JP (required by some games) on the deck; some games don’t provide JP text files to begin with to protect the local console market etc (it has gotten better)

There’s a whole wiki dedicated to how JP Steam users are shafted おま国

https://wikiwiki.jp/omakuni/おま国",SteamDeck
jh5zcm6,"I doubt it. The Japanese customer is a challenging one that require a massive amount of service and demand a polished product. 

I love my deck but as a non-english native the deck is a failure in case of localization. Valve goes even so far to delete all non-english localization files on the system that makes it even harder to use.",SteamDeck
jh5l4de,If it was a Japanese product and a little smaller then yeah. I think it’ll go over about as well as the Xbox.,SteamDeck
jh509kf,"Rimworld、Vahelim Linux version still can't display Chinese/Japanese/Korean(CJK) fonts,when you use desktop Steam app or Steam Deck UI to open it.

And when you open game directly at game folder,it just work=.=

So this two ""Verified"" games support CJK fonts,but CJK players need to open game directly at game folder.

Massive hit? I don't think so.

PC New Big Picture Mode officail version deleted CJK Virtual keyboard...


Edit1:

I tried a few Linux native game I have,and I found Streets of Rogue having same problem.   Compatibility: Playable


Don't have CJK Fonts display problem:
Fast Than Light,Prison Architect,Slay the Spire,Terraria,Stardew Valley,Slime Rancher

Edit2:
Some Japanese games don't have Japanese Interface&Subtitles on Steam,because companys wanted Japanese buy games on Japanese Consoles.",SteamDeck
jh4wigz,oh hell yeah it would,SteamDeck
jh4xfgg,"definitely not Japanese people will always put Japanese products above everything. Check sales of Microsoft consoles there and you will understand.

not to mention they are barely using computers for gaming so the need for a mobile gaming PC isn't there.

South Korea on the other hand could be a massive hit there as they love both mobile products and PC gaming.",SteamDeck
jh55bh9,Only if it comes out in grey,SteamDeck
jh542e2,"Big in Japan, alright!",SteamDeck
jh4pv0h,Is this sarcastic?,SteamDeck
jh4xnxf,I think the fact that a lot of 2023 games don't really work on it is going to gimp it a little. Hopefully its a big success though.,SteamDeck
jh54bxu,"Japan are more console based than pc and with the problems this thing has I can see it getting a lot of returns. 

It's the same here in the UK. We have a franchise store that gets trade in for electronics. I always see steam decks in the windows because most gamers here dont want the hassle of games not working or having to mess around to get certain games working. 

If the steam deck was a PlayStation deck it would do a lot better imo. And yes I know the 200-300 people on here that ""never get any problems"" are gonna dowvote me and not agree.",SteamDeck
jh60ys7,From what I read Japan has been hyped for the Deck.,SteamDeck
jh63qd4,The steamdeck is already selling better than series x/s in Japan lmao,SteamDeck
jh6amdp,"hope so. only issue I see with it struggling in japan is if its get highly compared to other consoles (which is entirely fair) but as we all know, its not always the most perfect and catered console like experience. some things are jank, some things dont work as well as they should etc..   


then again, console games these days I hear often have lots of issues too so many its not all that different.",SteamDeck
jh6fn43,"I feel that they will still strongly prefer the Switch. Would be cool to see it hit big, but it's one chunky handheld.",SteamDeck
jh6fn1o,"Not so much console, but the handheld scene. The 3DS and Switch sold gangbusters in Japan. There is a reason why the Monster Hunter games prioritized the 3DS for a while.The Xbox's have always been available in Japan but it barely sells there.

The Steam Deck has a real damn good chance to sell out in Japan.",SteamDeck
jh551a9,Is rather just a windows version of the steam deck myself so I can play the games I want.,SteamDeck
jh51cfl,"It might, if there’s interest.",SteamDeck
jh5ac2h,"I hope not. 

Selling in chains is a nightmare where they expect you to cut cost. Walmart would bully them into reducing costs going down to connectors. They make large electronics manufacturers do the same thing companies do for black Friday all year round. 

There was a documentary of this forever ago, but unless a company is as large and ruthless as Walmart, they will get shafted. The one story I remember was something like a lawnmower manufacturer. After the deal was signed, and the manufacturer was locked in legally,Walmart kept wanting lower cost. Made them pick lower quality metal, cheaper wheels, cheaper motor, etc. The manufacturer was stuck, and couldn't escape. By the end, their products were crap, and everyone blamed them. Years after they had still not recovered. 

There is also the support nightmare of the general population being generally technically illiterate.",SteamDeck
jh5h3bu,"There’s something about it that makes me think the deck is cooler if you get it from retail, because it’s something you can buy and use back to back",SteamDeck
jh4uo5o,"Some people say it is because of the AUD 3 million fine over Valve's refund policy which they got slapped with in 2017.

https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/valve-to-pay-3-million-in-penalties-for-misrepresenting-gamers-consumer-guarantee-rights

But I think it is rather that Valve considers this market not relevant, and expansion into more markets is currently limited by their production capacity.",SteamDeck
jh4x3fo,"Australia has a 25 million population, that's less then most EU countries. 
 
Considering they have no retail agreements, it might be a huge pain to deal with supply chain to get there, when they're not fulfilling capacity of countries with easier supply access. 
 
You're only feeling left out because Australia has early access to a lot of stuff in Media due to being a wealthy English speaking country, but virtual content is easier to deliver. 
 
Most countries outside EU/North America get a lot of delayed releases in multiple sectors.",SteamDeck
jh54vg0,I would exclude Australia just out of spite for their anti-freedom laws [forcing developers to implement backdoors](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/13/australian-bill-to-create-back-door-into-encrypted-apps-in-advanced-stages).,SteamDeck

jh4wm70,It’s portable. That’s it selling point.,SteamDeck
jh4xbff,"Japan has a verrrrry specific kink for handhelds. Historically they've supported even the most obscure of the bunch. The only things that will hold it back there are occasional user-unfriendliness and the fact that some people view it as little more than a fancy emulator for ""legally obtained"" game backups lol.",SteamDeck
jh4ws61,i say anyone who is into pc game will easily buy one.,SteamDeck
jh5neej,What the Deck has going for it is it’s the only way to play a number of Capcom and Square games portable. I don’t think will it be a huge hit by any means but it might get some traction based on the games available to it that aren’t available on the Switch.,SteamDeck
jh675dc,Hasn't it been available since January in Japan? How was it inconvenient?,SteamDeck
jh54xjk,"Nintendo aren't even making note of this lmao. Also Hyrule Warriors ran fine, what did you do to your switch?",SteamDeck

jh53at7,It is known that native Linux ports are quite whack. You can switch to proton on any steam run app to make it download windows version,SteamDeck
jh50sw0,"Not necessarily. PC gaming is actually quite strong here in Japan and a big chunk of sales for those Chinese handheld PCs are actually from Japan. There are even physical stores here dedicated to UMPCs and handhelds. The Steam Deck has gotten quite positive reception here ever since its official launch a few months ago and they're now officially selling it at physical stores as well, which could give it a huge boost.",SteamDeck
jh57qv8,"Maybe five years ago but things changed,  the pandemic made PC gaming extremely popular in Japan now. Also Valve had a expo for the steamdeck in Japan,  it had a million people come through it and see the expo.

jh52bz0,"That's a microsoft problem, look at apple for example. And pc gaming became quite large the past 5 years in japan.",SteamDeck
jh506we,"It's about software and marketing.  SD can definitely pull it off.  Steam has so many Asian developed games including unknown local indie games that even local Japanese players don't know about.

jh56ynn,Aren’t iPhones massively popular in Japan?,SteamDeck
jh55enl,Key word here is console.  Handheld and it's a whole other ball game.,SteamDeck
jh56he6,"well, if marketed right, there are no portables that really compete the same way. everyone there already has a Switch. and blanket saying “Japan only buy Japanese” isn’t really true. look at iPhone sales there.",SteamDeck
jh5kxm8,"I somewhat agree with this comment. Expecting something to be successful in Japan because it's popular elsewhere is complicated. Japan has will continue doing stuff their own way.

jh5itzi,How much of the pc gaming market there is just competitive games? Granted the steamdeck can run most of them (aside from anticheat rootkits) but you still need a dock/hub and peripherals unless you like controller gameplay.,SteamDeck
jh5v9h3,Microsoft consoles sell bad because they pretty much didn't have exclusives that would attract the Japanese market. That isn't an issue with the Steam Deck. I think it'll be interesting to see how it sells because it has a lot of check marks for why it'd succeed.,SteamDeck

jh6n1o4,"I'll actually give you some good advice here. There are many alternative system deck a lot of which are even more powerful than the steam deck and the majority of which run Windows. They're generally more expensive and a steam deck because they're not making money off selling the games and they have to pay for a Windows license.

Both are handheld gaming consoles with docking-options. The Nintendo E-Store over time has become filled with games that have long been part of the steam market place.

People that want to play Nintendo’s first party titles (and more) will still buy the Switch. People that want a handheld PC and the vast extended library that offers will still buy the Deck.

The Deck’s sales aren’t even 1% that of the Switch’s. Saying they’re in competition with each other is a discredit to the Deck.",SteamDeck

jh69l0h,"I agree. I'm a working statistician... Laypeople going around with ""one anecdote is not data"" is just cringeworthy. One anecdote is data, and not only so, often a single anecdote can build the whole picture. For example, ""nagasaki has been destroyed by a nuclear weapon"" answers all statistical questions about the tourism trade in that region in the years immediately following. ""Joe is a 12 year old boy"" answers all questions about that person's perceived market value as a purchaser of breast pumps. Even a single observation can inform what a distribution would look like: if I go to mars and see one martian who's green, then it's most likely that my preconceived notion that they're all blue is incorrect.

But you can completely skip this whole conversation because I wasn't talking about _statistical time-series data_, I was just talking about data as in _new information_. So holding ZeroNine's information to scrutiny like you're looking at a drug trial is just stupid. The user saw something, told us about it, we are smarter for it. End of story. No claims are made about the complete state of the world based off of that. No statistical predictions were made. No hypotheses floated. Anyone reading such things into this is just being an asshole.",SteamDeck

The guy just said he wants a model that comes with Windows, which honestly makes sense in the frame of selling the Deck to the masses at retail who don't want to fiddle around with compatibility problems. And setting up Windows and installing steam is what like 10 minutes? It might take 10 minutes to just get one game you want to run properly on Linux if it's not supported. And if you download Windows yourself you'll have to use big picture to get ui comparable to Deck's UI on SteamOS (which isn't as good), and which probably wouldn't be the case if Valve made a Windows model since they'd have to officially support it more.

Compared to something like a Nintendo Switch, the biggest competitor in the handheld console\* market, it's very large and very heavy, in ways that a strict numerical comparison of the size and weight doesn't really convey. For many people, that all means that it's couch portable, but not backpack portable.

Fortunately I've barely left the house in the past 3 years, so all of that is not a huge problem.

Also, the on-screen keyboard sucks, and desktop mode is a pain in the ass unless you're using an external mouse and keyboard.

\* - Yes the Steam Deck is a PC, but in typical use for the majority of people, it's a console. No I don't mean that in a bad way.

Valve I get it but you're technically in violation of the gpl if you don't fully open source your steamdeck Linux repositories to allow the greater Linux community to benefit from it as well.

Sometimes solutions are succinct, some are also viable alternatives, but some overcomplicate as much as they fix.  The good ones do stand out and get more word of mouth praise.

But you'll rely on these community projects to a fault and tolerate a likely possibility of unexpected incompatibility because the immense scope tackled by multiple asynchronized  pieces.  Also free, so beggars can't be choosers. But that could be said of any immature OS.  There is less opporunity to sit on an older static OS version with automatic updates on restart.

Not looking for advice on how to get it to work - I already spent more time than I would prefer tinkering with it. I don't buy $500 devices to have an IT project to work on, I just want the thing to work the way the marketing said it would.

I'm not gonna say ""lack of gamepass"" or ""fan is too noisy"" I understand that these kind of issue are hardware limitation, **or** stuff that are outside Valve's hand.

\- Sticks are too slippery, and too stiff, not precise enough for tiny camera movement, also the fact that they passed Q&A with all the click/crunch and other noise issue because of the sensor cable inside is baffling me.

\- The D pad is meh at best.

\- The screen is just bad, color are too blueish, not enough contrast, too much bleed, I understand that this is probably the part where they cut the most for the price, but it's just low tier, I've seen cheap mobile phone from Aliexpress or some 10y old TN screen with much better screen.

\- Back button are too hard to press if you don't put something on it to make them bigger

\- The keyboard is a pain to use, slow, sluggish, same goes for the touch screen.

\- The OS still need some polish, I don't know if it's because of my large steam library but it lag very often.

This doesn't seem to be an issue with steam games (vampire survivors/hzd), but I've consistently run into it with emulators.

Also it loses like, 20% a day while on standby, despite not doing anything in standby? I don't quite get that one, certainly needs to be addressed. If my iPad only loses 1% in standby while constantly flicking on for twitch and email notifications (which it has to stay connected to internet to do as well), then my steamdeck shouldn't be losing 20% while waiting for me to press the power button and doing nothing in the background.

jh2dghq,"The software and hardware (which includes the chassis and controller), don't seem completely polished yet. The operating system lacks stability when compared to a console and the physical appearance of the device isn't entirely cohesive. However, I knew what I was getting into before purchasing, so I have no complaints. On the other hand, it has exceeded my expectations in some areas.

I know that Valve is constantly improving the software, which is a major plus. Nevertheless, I hope that the Steam Deck 2 will be constructed with better attention to detail. It may sound like I'm being overly critical, but its really not that bad as it sounds. There are just a few minor issues that I've noticed: The trigger spring sometimes makes a sound, while the joysticks feel sticky and produce a slight noise at the center. Additionally, the casing tends to crackle a bit when pressure is applied in certain directions. Although this isn't a major issue, it's something that most devices with plastic casings of this size would likely experience.

Overall, I still adore the device despite its minor flaws. If Valve can rectify most of the software problems and introduce some crucial quality of life improvements, the Steam Deck will be nearly perfect.",SteamDeck
jh2duis,"I'm a little bias as I had to return mine twice (left capacitive touch not working), but the build quality is, imo a tad ""cheap"". QC also is somewhat lacking. Gotta cut the costs somewhere though, right?

The DPad is balls (the Vita spoiled me for life). When holding right it's way too easy to hit up/down by accident. As soon as replacement DPad PCB's are available I'll definitely be experimenting with Alps switches.

Touchscreen (with screen protector) is not as sensitive as I'm used to with other devices.

WiFi is spotty and disconnects sometimes. No other device in the house has this issue and my AP is decent (Ubiquiti nanoHD).

Having said all that, considering the price point, I can't really complain too much. £350 is a steal for what you're getting in return.

Things I'd like to see in the Steam Deck 2? Definitely some kind of VRR. 120Hz would be nice if the APU can handle it, but 40-60Hz VRR is a must. More powerful APU and better battery life, obvs.",SteamDeck

jh35xll,"How dare you attempt to limit me to only one complaint about the Deck!

Here's my 'Whine List':

* **OSK.** Still kinda sucks really. It's a LOT more tolerable now we got the few changes Valve made to improve it, but it's still got a long way to go before it could ever be as good to use as something like a phone touchscreen on Android. For a start it's often too slow, and the lack of any kind of predictive text makes it feel very clunky. I mean, I know enough about how this all works to know that I definitely don't blame Valve for the lack of predictive text, obviously that's not possible when using the keyboard in games for example, but it's still annoying.
* **Battery life.** The battery life is excellent for what the Deck does. But just because it's excellent, doesn't mean I can't still complain about it! Because while it's excellent, my internal spoiled brat is stomping her foot on the floor and saying, 'But why can't I have 20 hours straight battery life while playing GTA V!'.
* **Laggy UI Issues.** Particularly on the 'Collections' screen. It's obvious the UI is generating the thumbnails for each collection from scratch each time and not caching them. The result is about a 1 second long frame drop for me as it attempts to generate thumbnails for a dozen collections and a few hundred games.
* **No 'Screen Off' Button.** We have an off button. I want a 'screen off' button. Keeps games running, keeps the whole Deck running, just turns off the screen and mutes the audio. I don't know how this could possibly work in a way which won't be confusing to users and result in a bunch of misuse and battery life disasters, but it's still something I want, because I want to be able to turn off the Deck's screen when I need to leave it somewhere downloading a game for 30 minutes, it just feels wrong leaving the screen unchanging showing a progress bar for 30 minutes, like it's going to cause screen burnin or something.

Understandably the biggest complaint I might have for the Deck however is just the general 'bugginess' of the whole software stack. It's becoming less a Deck specific issue and more just a general familiar level of bugginess that Valve has in a lot of their software. They make incredible things which I love but they often get things about '90% stable' and seem to start working on the next incredible thing and forget to polish the experience of what they already made.

But no that's not my biggest complaint.

Nor is my biggest complaint just the manner in which Valve just seems very inconsistent and low-attention-span in their management. Like for example, in the first launch months of the Deck, they started doing monthly update videos. We got one each month for the first 2 months, then another at the 4 month mark then nothing for a long time, then one at the 12 month mark. It's like someone said 'We should do monthly update videos', then they got to the 4 month mark and said 'Nah this is boring'.

But no that's not my biggest complaint either.

My biggest complaint is... This is my favourite gaming device of all time and I can't spend 24/7 on it because I have to sleep, eat and work for most hours of each day. :(",SteamDeck

Controller Support, at least with playable, not verified, games.  It's a nuisance but not a deal breaker but sucks how older games are like 'press [button1], press [mouse1], press [E]' and you basically need to memorize your controller mapping, worse is when the game doesn't support mapping of all functions in the game unlike the game's console side version, but that's a nitpick.

Battery Life, which is fixed with a portable battery, buy a third party deck clip + battery to attach it to, boom, 8 hour battery life, plus I don't mind the weight.  But standalone, that battery life defeats the portable idea.

Incompatibility issues with more modern 'service' games.  I'm talking about Ubisoft connect, anti-cheat, game launchers being required.  Standard steam deck needs a good deal of work arounds for some games.

My main issue with the screen is the fact that myself and others from what I've seen have had light bleeding on Steam Deck screens despite them being brand new.

It's only a problem for games that don't require the second joystick, which is probably why it wasn't addressed. If I have to twin stick anything, I'm not hitting them as much. But in retro games or 2D games in general, I feel like the buttons could be improved some.",SteamDeck

For the software it was weird stuff like to make the haptics on the trackpads feel normal I had to set the intensity in different places and reboot after every step to get the settings to stick, and even then as soon as a game loaded or I went to desktop mode those settings were forgot and I was right back to one trackpad being on low haptics and the other being on max.

This place is a good resource but it is frustrating at times.,SteamDeck
jh141v0,"The dock/undock experience. It's such a pain in the ass. Sometimes it just works and it's magic, but more often I'll put the Deck in the dock and the Deck's screen will go dark but the monitor won't wake up. Or the monitor will wake up and just display a black screen. I unplug the dock to try again and the Deck stays dark for like 5-10 seconds, so I have to wait. Then it lights up and I plug it back in. Sometimes it'll work the second try, sometimes it'll do the same shit, sometimes it will connect and work...but at the wrong resolution or refresh rate.

SteamOS doesn't seem to remember the settings you assigned to each monitor, either. It does in Desktop mode, but in Game mode I seemingly have to set my monitor to the right settings every time. This is a huge pain in the ass because one of my monitors is 1440p 165hz, but the deck can only do 1440p 120hz...but it STILL TRIES 165hz and gets stuck at a black screen. I have to go in and turn on monitor safe mode, then connect the monitor, then set it to 1440p 120hz, then it's fine. Until the next time I connect it, I have to do the same shit again.

I know we're all tired of Switch comparisons but I can jackhammer the Switch into and out of the dock rapid fire and it connects and displays instantly, it switches back to the device screen instantly. Over and over, 100% reliably, it just works every time. Plus Switch games can have different performance profiles for docked and undocked and again, swap between them instantly every time. Audio also always goes to the right place without having to make sure ""External Device"" is selected, because seemingly at random my Deck will decide to use its own speakers instead.

And this isn't limited to one dock or monitor, I've tried it with a bunch of different monitors and a bunch of different TVs. I've used just plain usb-c to hdmi/displayport cables, I've used fancy docks, I've used cheap ones, I own the *official dock*, and they all run into the same bullshit.

This also glosses over issues with screen aspect and scaling. I've pretty much given up on smoothly using my Deck in the same way I use my Switch. Whenever I think about docking it I just remember how much of a pain it is and don't bother. I really hope this improves.",SteamDeck
jh142az,"Launchers are the worst.

The second worst thing is that someone dropped mine or sat on it or something and it's got a little crack in the front chassis which isn't worth the effort fixing it would take but I know it's there and it bothers me a tiny bit.

Also the newer ones, as we have two in my house, are a bit better build quality.

3) would be nice to have xbox series s APU in it (it whould run just as nice if not more energy efficient than steam deck's)
2) most modern game are not optimized for 720p(800p even more so). Frequently you get terrible aliasing, and no antialiasing can save you. Also the games are making more computation than needed at that resolution, resulting in hot AF system with terrible performance. 
1) one nvme 2230 slot is not enough. Would be nice to have at least 2280. Even better 2280 + 2.5

And yeah, I realise it will make the deck big AF. I'm Okay with it having a 9-10 inch screen, just make it at least 900p, ideally 1800p. And yeah, the cost will probably be twice or thrice that of the steam deck. For series s performance in your hand? Totally worth it xD",SteamDeck

I dunno how wayland works very well, and there's no way to force a custom resolution without doing GRUB stuff apparently.

I'd also add that while it has seemed sturdy for me personally it feels even 'cheaper/plasticky' than the switch which 'felt' very cheap next to the vita. 
This is totally fine and it feels light and manageable enough, but it does lack a 'premium feel' . 

That maybe a ridiculous thing to ask for but ironically when I got the switch I knew this device was designed to be used by children compared to the vita that probably was also designed for kids, but it felt like a stylish piece of premium tech (possibly due to size and relative heft), where as if the deck was that hefty, would probably be ergonomically horrible for it's size.",SteamDeck
jh19ou9,"Scrolling through the menus is clunky. Throughout the system.  And Sometimes going from the game to gamepad settings then back to the game can cause my SD to restart.   I think it has to do with setting the refresh rate something other than 60hz for the game, but the settings menu changes back to 60hz.   



I agree with a lot of people here about the screen.   I do find turning the brightness up all the way helps.   Using vibrantdeck is a must, IMO.  I actually change the gamma slightly by reducing the green to 80.   Looks much better.

The wifi is annoying too.

Sometimes I need to exit a game or bring up the settings menu before it'll recognize the connection. And, of course, sometimes it works perfectly.

I waited for the official dock rather than getting a standard USB hub because I wanted to feel confident about that sort of usability, but even after multiple firmware updates it's still a regular issue.",SteamDeck

* No standby downloads

* Screen is pretty bad. Not the resolution, but contrast and colorspace. I shouldn't have to download a plugin to somewhat remedy it. Don't get me started on backlight bleed.

* Software issues galore. Games needing tweaking to work (maybe at all), menus not showing up at the right time, controller inputs changing while in standby, etc.

* The fan is kinda loud.

* Starting MSRP is definitely not $400 and people need to stop acting like it is. At minimum, you're paying for a 256GB or 512GB microSD card to complement the 64GB storage. If you're more inclined, you're buying a used drive off of eBay for $50~$55. Regardless, $450 is more accurate though it seems a lot of people opt for the 256GB or 512GB Decks anyway.

* The community, partially. If you have a problem, you're very likely able to find a solution through some forum or avenue. However, there's just waaaaay too much hugboxxing for any real discussion. r/SteamDeck is particularly guilty of this, with any mention of the negatives being heavily downvoted or swarms of user rushing to the defense about their flawless experiences with the device.

jh1fk0y,"There's been a quirk with the ""new"" fan curve where if the Deck isn't using much power, the fan will randomly ramp up to around 4000RPM for a second, die down for half a minute, and do it again. I vaguely remember reading an article saying Valve were aware of it and should release a fix, because it's such an irritating behaviour. You can get used to a set high fan speed, but constantly ramping up and down is distracting.

The touchscreen is also mega doo doo and in my experience the worst thing about the deck by far. Doesn't matter in 99% of cases, but it would be nice to play games like Little Inferno with touch.",SteamDeck
jh1fk83,"My biggest complaints are:

1. The Steam Dock

This thing has been a huge pain in the butt for me. I have to unplug the charging cable, switch to desktop mode, plug the Deck into the dock, switch to gaming mode, wait for the TV to show the home screen, then plug in the power cable. Sometimes the screen flickers black then back on, sometimes it flickers black then turns green, and sometimes the TV screen just turns black. The latter two I have to re-do all the previous steps. I'm used to the switch where it's literally as simple as ""Drop it in the dock, and you're done.""

Yes, the dock has updated firmware that was supposed to fix the charging cable issue. There's no pending updates and I can't find a way to force it to re-update.

2. Not being able to download while locked/away at work

Would be nice to pick a game to load, let it download overnight or while I'm away at work, then play it. Supposedly desktop mode will still download while the screen is locked, so I'll have to try that out.",SteamDeck
jh1fkyn,"this fucking thing WILL NOT PLAY AUDIO through my receiver. i've trying using the official and 3rd party doc and it just won't. I want it to be as seamless as the switch and now I'm considering shelling out a chunk of dough to get a new receiver I don't otherwise need.

jh1frte,"I wish the on-screen touch mouse worked how remote desktop on iOS works. The mouse has two options, the touch option where the cursor moves where you touch, and another where your finger on the touch screen moves the cursor from it’s current position and you can see and more accurately click where you need to.

The on-screen keyboard is strange in general. Steam+x to bring it up manually when needed, but why does this sometimes close automatically? Also, I want to turn off the default joystick behavior. This is probably a great method, but for me at least currently it isn’t helpful.",SteamDeck

jh1g3yq,"Bluetooth on this thing is fundamentally bad and I do not understand why it doesn't get more coverage. There's inherent bluetooth input lag with every single device that makes using a wireless controller while docked (or anything, really) an absolute pain. If you're the type of person who needs Game Mode to play on a TV, you'll be endlessly frustrated by the input lag. On top of that, all of my devices have a ton of difficulty connecting to the Deck. My keyboard takes multiple tries, all of my controllers take multiple tries, it's an utter pain in the ass.

I have zero clue why they designed the Deck thumbsticks the way they did - they're destined to grind down over time on the edges of the plastic, and my left stick is already showing some pretty serious wear over the course of the past year-ish of using mine.

The fundamental experience of browsing through Steam on the Steam Deck in SteamOS mode, to this day, is *still* filled with inconsistencies and bugs, ranging from sound not working on some screens, to input working in strange ways on other screens. It feels so cheap that the Deck will slow down while scrolling through my library.

For no reason that I can pick up, sometimes my Steam Deck just fails to wake up from sleep the first few times I hit the button, and other times it'll wake up, but only some of the inputs will work for a bit before everything works. Or it'll crash when I wake it up.

Offline mode doesn't track my playtime.

I don't blame Valve for this one - but the sheer number of workarounds that are needed for some games to just work is frustrating. It's so demoralizing to try and play a game only to realize that it just isn't going to cooperate with the Steam Deck for reasons outside your control. Things like the memory leak issue that plagued GTA5 for months or the part where Achievements just weren't working for ME: Legendary for a while, or Ubisoft games performing terribly due to Ubiconnect, and more.",SteamDeck

jh1hfp4,"The keyboard settings in game mode don't work properly. You can change the on-screen keyboard layout, but not the physical keyboard layout, unless you're in desktop mode.

When you have a lot of small patches to download, some of the patches are randomly scheduled, but the scheduled ones are at the bottom of the list. If you try to scroll down to queue them up, when the current download finishes, the list index resets to the top, so you basically can't just queue them all up at once and then let them finish.

The system for finding where your game data is installed vs save data is impenetrable and requires additional apps that give hints as to where they are, instead of making them easy to access at a click.

If you wait too long to update your flatpaks, the Discover app hangs on update unless you disable wifi, reboot, then re-enable wifi. It's the most ridiculous bug.

There are audio issues that happen if you go into sleep mode while a game is running. It gets all crackly and bad.

I dunno if they ever fixed this, but I believe there was a bug where it would treat non-steam apps as steam games, and not let you run one on the steam deck while your PC was playing a steam game.

My favorite d-pad is the PlayStation design, with its pseudo-separated 4-way focus. And my least favorite is definitely the 360 d-pad, which tried *way* too hard to be a third joystick and ended up being garbage for *everything* (later XBox controllers fixed that to some extent, but it's still too easy to accidentally hit the diagonals, imho).

The Steam Deck's d-pad feels almost as good as the PlayStation ones, probably on-par with classic Nintendo to me, and is honestly a big highlite for the system since I was worried it would be too soft and rockable like a lot of third-party controllers (honestly a lot of them seem to mimic the 360 d-pad's feel for some stupid reason)...",SteamDeck

jh104e6,"OLED panels for gaming handhelds are extremely harder to get right than a TV or monitor though. If a third party OLED replacement ever becomes available, I'd advise waiting for reviews before buying it. 

For instance, the Vita's OLED is quite bad by modern standards, and they had to sacrifice one of the main aspects of OLED (pure blacks) to combat black smearing. Those panels are being used by companies like Anbernic with their 2023 OLED handhelds. Trust me, you don't want to use a 2012 cheap OLED panel in 2023. 

The Switch OLED uses a modern OLED panel, and it doesn't suffer from noticeable black smearing. But to reach the price point, it's using a B grade panel filled with issues *and* instead of an individual calibration step, Nintendo preloads a default curve that only truly matches the display at 50% and 100% brightness, causing a lot of artifacts to appear. Between the issues with the Steam Deck's LCD (light bleed, lower color accuracy, weak contrast) versus the issues with Nintendo's OLED (green subpixel artifacts, uneven white point, brightness curve white point issues) I'd honestly take the Steam Deck's panel every time.",SteamDeck

With the Deck though, I can rest the damn thing on my breasts and give my arms a break even while it's charging. Can game for hours like this.

jh0x0ix,"Sounds like my PSP days. Pushing through the rest of a DJMax song even though I can't feel half my fingers anymore, lol... Say what you want about the Deck, imho flat back handhelds like the PSP and Switch without a grip is waaay worse.",SteamDeck

""Long periods"" being, like, 15 seconds.",SteamDeck
jh1pvi1,That is the reason why Valve haven't released an official SteamOS distro yet.,SteamDeck
jh1odoy,"Yeah KDE has been plagued with multi-monitor bugs for years. It was substantially improved in a recent update (5.27), but the Steam Deck is currently on version 5.26.

And 5.27 didn't fix all multi-monitor bugs, just a lot of them.

Gnome has had pretty great multi-monitor support for years, and it's pretty damn stable in general. But it does have the issue of worse fractional scaling support.

E: to be clear I mean KDE Plasma 5.27, the newest release. I'm not referring to kernel version.",SteamDeck
jh25xsi,"Me too with Paypal. It asks for my email/phone to login, I enter it and hit next, then it keeps asking for it in an infinite loop.",SteamDeck
jh2n1i7,"Same. I had to boot up my PC to buy Elden Ring last weekend. As someone that spends 5 days of the week away from home in a HGV, being able to purchase on the deck to then download over a mobile data connection would be useful.",SteamDeck

jh26n5k,"I cannot buy anything on the deck via the steam store, it tries to do the card verification and then doesn't work.  I have to go to my gaming desktop, buy the game, and then back to the deck to install it.

Similarly if I want to get something for my son I can't gift him a game because you can't accept the gift via the deck interface.  I have to go back to my desktop, login as him, buy the game, and install.  

Love the deck but as you said this nonsense needs fixing.  If the plan is the generate sales with low cost hardware, easy purchasing is surely a priority?",SteamDeck
jh4fd1y,"I got caught out on my last trip, my plane was delayed, I wanted to play GTA but couldn’t because I had no internet connection and hadn’t launched the game for a while.",SteamDeck
jh1i6rh,I just tried this fix yesterday. Waiting to see if it works.,SteamDeck
jh1z1ct,"As long as the Deck's connected, the WiFi is superb. But I had plenty disconnects until I fiddled with the power management and even now it sometimes loses connection to the Steam servers and fails to reestablish it. Really a bummer, I love my Deck!",SteamDeck
jh2a5sz,"The issue isn't wifi per se, it's that the Deck doesn't always reconnect to the Steam servers after reconnecting to the wifi, usually after waking up from a long sleep. The dev settings OP is talking about is turning off power management mode so [I assume] the wifi doesn't shut off all the way in deep sleep. Even the setting says it can improve 5GHz reliability.",SteamDeck

jh0ybyg,Charging while using USB-C output is my main issue.,SteamDeck
jh1aits,"One of the benefits in mind is ease of docking: a USB-C port at the bottom makes for a seamless docking experience like the Nintendo switch, but the current Deck has to awkwardly dock with a small cable plugged in at the top. The deck has the perfect position for portably gaming while charging but deciding on one location over another has a drawback resolved by two port locations.

In similar terms, the Nintendo switch has the perfect port location for easy docking yet the worst spot for charging while playing portable. Both devices would benefit from two ports.",SteamDeck
jh0vvvk,"1 port for charging, 1 port to plug a USB-C portable monitor.",SteamDeck
jh2s2qw,"Exactly my use case. I'm in the market for the Nreal Airs but I'm concerned about battery drain. And that Red Magic Dock has to be ordered from China with random, expensive pricing. IMO it should realistically cost less than $15 if more than 1 company made it.",SteamDeck
jh12jwf,"That does help. My wife is a wiz at taking apart and repairing our laptops, so hopefully she can help if that comes to pass.",SteamDeck
jh1t7lb,"They don't provide them ALL, just most of the main ones.

There is no motherboard and a lot of one off ribbon cables and similar things are not readily available",SteamDeck

jh38vc8,Wouldn't this get pretty uncomfortable after a while having your neck cranked down looking towards your lap?,SteamDeck
jh3kj6t,"I just leave mine plugged in. It seems smart about managing the charge for the sake of battery longevity, so I don't have any reservations about doing this.",SteamDeck
jh4na64,"Same here. Could be because I shut it off every night, instead of just putting it to sleep.",SteamDeck
jh4av6q,"I have a gaming PC and while I'd be happy to ditch Windows, I have to say that SteamDeck is not selling me on Linux as an operating system. The amount of utterly inane jargon I have to know to understand how to navigate to basic stuff is pretty infuriating even before the awkward and inconsistent desktop controls. I could never explain to a casual PC gamer how to do this stuff. I could give a general idea to a windows user of what to do by saying ""find the game directory, then look for the following folders or files"" or ""go to your computer settings menu and check under this heading to find options for your controller/network/graphics settings.""",SteamDeck
jh14rqf,"Yeah it becomes less of a downside over time, once you start to familiarize yourself with Linux. Problem is, that feeling might not be shared with everyone.",SteamDeck
jh29aaz,"Nah, Windows on a handheld is not much better. With Windows a ton of features could not be integrated, games still would need custom control maps, launchers would still suck and control switching would suck even harder. The only fiddly thing Windows would fix is actual game compatibility. Still way of Console ""just works"".",SteamDeck
jh0z913,Dual track pad typing is honestly great,SteamDeck
jh202jn,It's worst than the one they had for the steam controller.,SteamDeck

jh1ut1c,"Me too, it never occurs to me to use it",SteamDeck
jh20v3s,"I know about it and bind it in with mouse movement normally, I just dislike using it due to the zoom cropping off large chunks of the screen.",SteamDeck
jh23iws,I believe they are referencing the absurd mods people often post here.,SteamDeck
jh2d6wl,"Why would I buy a Steam Deck instead of just building a gaming PC, then?",SteamDeck
jh1rnob,"As a Switch OLED and Deck owner, the Switch panel is so much better it's not even a contest.",SteamDeck
jh1d068,I’ve had my deck for a month and only recently realized I could push the back buttons in towards the screen instead of on the handles. For a while I avoided using them because they were uncomfortable and now they are very useful lol.,SteamDeck
jh16240,"To fix that problem I bought Playvital back grips, and now the buttons are way more comfortable",SteamDeck
jh13sve,That took a while for me to figure out too just because I'm so accustomed to the console pro controllers that do it the other way.,SteamDeck
jh10hw6,"I know, but it's  a weird design choice and the buttons are still harder to press than on an elite controller or any controller with back button, especially when you're playing something requiring quick reflexes",SteamDeck
jh119gc,Yeah that one made me laugh. 4k60 on a 400 dollar handheld.,SteamDeck
jh1l051,"To be fair, he did say with an eGPU.

Which I think is a fair criticism because even with the Switch the general consensus is if you are going to have a Dock, why not make the Dock give the console a little extra oomph? I mean at least essentially put it in an overclocked mode when docked.",SteamDeck

jh1d76a,"You are right. It's just that I can't really fault the device. I have to go into stuff that people champion the device for that I don't agree with.

For me, this thing is totally magical. It is just not doing what people say it is doing. This is not a distilled PC gaming device in portable form.",SteamDeck
jh3eb8b,Yeah touchpad typing is the one for anything but the most involved processes in desktop mode where I would just connect a BT keyboard.,SteamDeck
jh1fudi,I have a cheap bluetooth keyboard I keep in the living room for just that occasion,SteamDeck

jh1c5h0,"It is, yet keyboard functionality is still poor.",SteamDeck
jh0ylth,If Valve tried to enforce that then they'd see the bigger publishers just leave the store altogether. They have very little sway there.,SteamDeck
jh2h9ig,Double edged,SteamDeck
jh11w1l,"Would this really be a good thing though? It seems to me that rather than trying to strong-arming publishers out of using launchers, that it would be more productive to improve integration across launchers.

From what I've heard, some publishers are quite uncomfortable with the idea of game retailers like Steam having so much power and control over how their games launch, which has driven companies like Paradox Interactive to develop their own launcher. It just seems to me that the market is incentivizing publishers to have their own launchers and therefore the best outcome for consumers would be for said launchers to exist in a framework where they operate and integrate smoothly alongside retailer launchers. 

Pushing against this market trend seems to me like it would prolong the problem you want addressed.",SteamDeck
jh4svln,"Yeah the EA launcher just minimizes in the background upon launch of the game on the deck, you don't interact with it at all",SteamDeck
jh15ky5,I’m waiting to see this Windows handheld mode before I install Windows 11. I tried dual booting before and hated all the hoops I had to jump through to get the Steam Decks controller inputs to work in non-Steam games.,SteamDeck

Amazing that you can run a modern windows on an microsd card?",SteamDeck
jh1sv1e,"The PSP was more comfortable to use than the Switch or the Vita in my opinion. Of course, I had the PSP-1000 and not one of the later slimmer revisions, so I imagine I wouldn't like those as much even if they have a nicer screen.",SteamDeck

jh2po62,I have Cubital Tunnel Syndrome too! I would give you a high five but half my hand is numb...,SteamDeck
jh2v6n3,"I struggled with RSI in both arms for years. the things that really turned it around for me were:

1. stellar ergonomics. work on your posture. while sitting, try to get 90 on your legs and not hunched over. NEVER use a wrist reset our bend wrists to type/mouse/etc
2. strengthen your arms and your core! i have OK arm muscle from drumming, but my core was very week. crunches, light jogging, and other core focused exercises were the key to getting close to normal again

good luck and stay healthy! If you have insurance and are in any kind of pain/tingling get your doctor to refer you to physical therapy. its time consuming, but can be life changing",SteamDeck

jh30hqm,"That's strange, I buy stuff from the store almost exclusively on my deck and it's never given me any issues, and I even accepted a game my sister gifted me on the deck itself with no problem. It's strange how stuff works for some but not others when it comes to tech",SteamDeck
jh1nxpl,"I'm quite impressed by how many people own USB-C monitors, I've never seen one in my life. My hub charges my Deck while I use the HDMI output. Totally get your point though.",SteamDeck
jh182ja,"This. But I recently found [this dock-charger](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B18CMW88). It's basically a USB dock with 60W PD via USB C, a 5W USB A port, and a HDMI port, all in the form factor of a simple, small charger wallwart. It uses GaN so it's nice and small.

It used to have pretty bad reviews about its HDMI output, but then I checked again and they were gone. I haven't used it for its HDMI output yet. But it works well for extra USB. I use it with this ancient 100 Mb/s Ethernet dongle I originally bought for my Wii U and it works great for that.

The A port supposedly doesn't support USB hubs, but I haven't tried yet.

The A port can also charge the other device.

JSAUX has a similar device ish but theirs is worse (I think it had only 4k30 or something).",SteamDeck
jh1pdul,"Not gonna argue on that, you're right.  
Also the current placement of the USB-C port is pretty destructive for the power cord. First thing I got was a 180° angle to relieve the bending.",SteamDeck
jh1y8zs,"I remember it always being a thing in the early days of smartphones and also iPods whether the aux port would be on top or on the bottom. They'd switch it up sometimes, so you'd see the benefits of both. A USB C port has enough utility that it could justify 2, so one on top and bottom would be a good idea.",SteamDeck
jh0w62g,I think using a USB hub is the cleaner solution. You only plug it in when you need it. But might be my personal opinion.,SteamDeck
jh0yg69,Any reasonably priced USB c monitor should have USB passthrough charge.,SteamDeck
jh19zz2,"If she can fix a laptop, she can fix your Deck.

I've done a lot of laptop and small desktop work because I like small, cozy, modular spaces. Kept an old laptop running by repasting the CPU and GPU lol.

The Deck is almost fully accessible without adhesive woes. As far as I'm aware the screen is adhered to the front shell and that's the only major glue-ing. Which means it'll be fairly simple, if possibly time consuming, and requiring keeping all the parts straight.",SteamDeck
jh14y1o,"Absolutly, for the mainstream appeal I would wish it would run smoother. Heck for my own sanity I wish that. But if the only way to achieve that would have been Windows I am glad they choose steamos",SteamDeck
jh2o579,"You'd also lose a lot of performance, specially in I/O",SteamDeck
jh2pwkj,"I've been using Windows on handhelds since 2018, and ""not much better"" is putting it lightly. It sucks, is what it does. I wish the whole handheld industry followed suit and worked with Valve to adopt SteamOS as an officially supported first-party option.

jh1oxym,Until you need to capitalise a single letter when it becomes incredibly annoying.,SteamDeck

jh17h8m,"It's the best option, for sure.

Until it gets basic stuff like a CTRL key?  It's still kinda ass to me.",SteamDeck

jh2a8lj,"Sure, I'll give you a list with quick descriptions and what Valve's rated it.

Farming Sim 22 (Playable) is co-op, you can farm together.

For life sims and harvest-moon-likes my GF and I were enjoying Stardew Valley (Verified) as well as Dinkum (Playable, early access). Traveller's Rest (Verified, early access) is also a fun one, focusing on running a tavern.

2D side-scrolling exploration base-building RPG: Terraria (Verified) is a blast with more than one person, and there's an absolute ton of things to do and reasons to replay over and over again. Get into mods (via tmodloader) and you'll never see the light of day again cuz you'll be too busy playing Terraria! ;)

If you want a Diablo-esque twin-stick co-op shooter, The Ascent (Verified) is a fun cyberpunk romp through a decaying arcology.

Sandbox space exploration: Astroneer (Playable) is a fun builder/explorer. It's really cute and the UI is all in-universe.

Sandbox space exploration: No Man's Sky (Verified) is a labour of love, and a great experience flying with a friend. I don't think you can start together, but after getting to the anomaly you can meet up very easily and explore together after that. Very freeform, so you'd have to work together to plan what you want to do.

Looter shooters: Borderlands series (Playable) are looter shooters, first two games are great but they cashed in and wrecked the story in the third in my opinion. I'd recommend 2, or 3 if you don't give a shit about story.

Fantasy Looter shooter: Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (Verified) way more engaging, plot-wise than BL3. Makes a metric butt-ton of tabletop gaming jokes. Enjoyed it a lot with my girlfriend, ended up both enjoying it far more than BL3.

Classic-ish RPG: Divinity Original Sin 1&2 (Verified) are classic RPGs so if you're fans of any pen-and-paper games you might dig these.

2D side-scrolling colony survival: Kingdom Two Crowns (Verified) and later in the series entries too. They're really atmospheric games that have a good amount of puzzles and secrets to find as you grow your settlement and defend it.

Monster hunting: Monster Hunter Rise (Playable) is a... monster hunting game. You wield big heckin' weapons and fight a huge roster of progressively larger creatures. Expect a lot of variety, from hunting small game to small predators to giant fucking winged, lighting-breathing bastards. Really fun to play as a team of up to 4, difficulty is dynamic so it will adjust to just the two of you.

Racing: Need For Speed: Heat (Playable) needs the EA App, fair warning, but it was fun as hell racing on a team with my girlfriend and showing off our customized cars after winning a bunch of money.

Goose: Untitled Goose Game (Honk! (Verified)) is a game about honking and being a horrible goose. You can be horrible geese *together*.

Recommended to me but haven't played them alone or together yet, but folk seem to like em:
- Wolf Quest (Verified) be a wolf, I guess
- Valheim (Verified) viking survival builder, maybe
- Warhammer Inquisitor Martyr & Prophecy (both Playable)",SteamDeck

We have half a dozen different sales platforms because publishers didn’t want to give steam a cut and in the end, they all either have already left (epic) or they’ve come crawling back. (EA).

Even with a launcher steam still has 100% control if they want it. That the nature of steam as a platform and besides, at the end of the day, steam just launches an .exe.

I think the easiest method I've found for non-Steam games is Steam Deck Tools. You can have it auto-run and it's just a right click menu away from switching between desktop controls and X360 controls.

edit: Adding in that ideally you use borderless fullscreen when you can so you can use the gesture that allows you to switch apps.

Windows Steam deck tools is a suite that shows your steam deck controls to windows as an Xbox controller, ds4, or steam controller. It has several shortcuts built into it, so while it's primarily functionally an Xbox 360 controller, steam+b will force close, steam+x will bring up windows keyboard. Every game just sees it as an Xbox controller, ds4, or whatever you config the steam controller settings to. It's very cool",SteamDeck

jh1joze,"Nice… I thought this would have become more common YEARS ago with how common USB-C laptops are. I’ll probably get one for my wife. 

I have a 65w brick that has 1 USB-C + 1 USB-A port but it doesn’t act as a hub, only charging. :-(",SteamDeck

jh0xwtc,"Your only option for a usbc dp alt mode capable hub is to spend upwards of $300 and those are too big to mount to the back of the deck with something like deckmate. I've found a single usb4 hub on amazon that has a usbc video out but for some reason it doesnt work with the steam deck and for some reason other small usb4 hubs that are usbc PD powered dont want to provide thunderbolt4/usb4 ports that people can hook to portable usbc monitors.

The options boil down to carrying a large hub that requires a barrel connector for power or using hdmi+usb to usb c on a smaller usbc dock, but those often have issues with delivering enough power.

I'm waiting for a usbc hub that I can mount to the back that also provides a usb4/usbc dp alt out port. Something like the anker 556 with usb4 out. This is why the deck having 2 of its usbc ports that do everything would be super handy.",SteamDeck

jh1a8c1,"Y'all skipped over the ""**with** an eGPU"" part. They're playing docked with a desktop-level GPU attached through the SSD's PCIe port and very likely output to an external screen.

They aren't complaining that the deck itself can't do 4k60 on its own of course; they're just saying that the CPU can't keep up when you add a powerful GPU.",SteamDeck

jh2xh3b,"Nothing lasts for ever. Steam has a strong grip on the PC game market, but Valve needs the big publishers more than they need them.

Of course, Steam has a big advantage, Valve is not a public company so they don’t have to worry about shareholders.

But many new players don’t have a large library in Steam and are open to alternatives.",SteamDeck
jh1tzk4,Large publishers started returning to Steam after Valve made concessions on a lower revenue share and in EA’s case the ability to sell their first party game subscription service directly through Steam.,SteamDeck
jh2u6ti,"Not only that, the actual device has a fractional market share compared to the desktop Steam marketplace.",SteamDeck
jh2i5mv,"Valve has made concessions to publishers, they haven’t had them just crawling back. Further, Epic has a huge amount of money to bankroll their competing platform and would absolutely take advantage.",SteamDeck
jh2nyrg,"Is this not already an implicit requirement? Are there Verified games that still have launchers? 

Even if there isn't an outright ""no launchers"" classification for Verified, the launcher would need to provide a seamless experience, basically run in fullscreen, with controller input, and cleanly exit _before_ the game launches and allow the Deck to transition to the game itself.

At that point if a launcher meets all that criteria, it's probably fine to stay if it provides some functionality that's actually useful.",SteamDeck
jh19sml,"But what if Steam goes bankrupt, pushes certain games off their platform, or makes it more expensive for publishers to use their platform? If a publisher has put all their eggs into the Steam basket, then they are SOL when something bad happens from Steam's end. At least if they have their own launcher, then that's one less thing they have to worry about.

And Steam doesn't just launch a .exe. it can download mods, launch games with mods, and download/launch betas. Not sure if it also does anything as far as multiplayer configurations in the background. It's kind of hard to separate Steam's launching of games from the rest of Steam, but stuff related to mods definitely stands out to me based on what I've seen in other launchers. 

Also the fact that Steam puts all the games in one easily accessible place, so a user doesn't have to depend on the OS for that (in some cases, I've found that Windows doesn't show me my games in the Start menu). I've noticed that launchers often put all the games associated with that launcher in one place, so I don't have to find that .exe file.",SteamDeck
jh18x3q,"Is ""Windows Steam Deck Tools"" the same as the drivers Valve released, or a separate installation?",SteamDeck

jh3bz4n,"Honestly not seeing a few titles from ea and Ubisoft would not make my days as a user of steam darker. There are plenty of good games (even AAA games) that don't use launchers. I would still stick to this platform anyway. If I'm not alone in this - publishers will come back , because they would lose a ton of revenue otherwise.",SteamDeck

Valve bowed to them lol",SteamDeck
jh2k55n,Isn’t Epic just that thing you log into once a week to get a free game that you never play?,SteamDeck
jh1c9gb,"But like I said, these are all problems with Steam as a platform. And that doesn’t make sense either. Having a storefront/launcher isn’t the same as making it A requirement to play your game. Yeah you can still have origin (or whatever it’s called now) and not require me to open it every time I want to play one of their games. It in no way protects them from steam as a monopoly. It only creates an inconvenience. I understand not wanting to be beholden to one option but that doesn’t mean you have to shove your option down my throat.",SteamDeck
jh1driv,"Seperate, it's a seperate software via github, but it works GREAT",SteamDeck
jh1fv3u,"Drivers are always needed as first step. The extra apps like Steam Deck Tools then allow things like the controller to be detected correctly in all games not just Steam games. I've tried out a few of these and Steam Deck Tools is probably the most straight forward - you can set it to load on start, each thing is a different component so you don't need to use it all at once - and it's very easy to switch between desktop mode and X360 controller mode.

edit: Adding in that ideally you use borderless fullscreen when you can so you can use the gesture that allows you to switch apps. Easiest way to get into/out of non-Steam games and get to the desktop without relying on setting up controller shortcuts. There's a touch gesture for that in Win 10 and Win 11.",SteamDeck

jh41s4z,"Yeah I’d still use steam too. It is risky though because depending on how long (and how many) big publishers held out, Valve might miss a lot of chances to onboard new users that would’ve come for a specific AAA game. The unfortunate truth is that the minority of players are affected (or care) so Valve doesn’t need to take the risk atm.",SteamDeck

jh4x2k6,"Pretty good showcase of the cases, although I'd personally prefer the camera just a bit farther away on the top-down shots.

It's actually refreshing to see someone just pull out the case, show it off, and try it on. Modern reviewers can go a little overboard with the b-roll and fancy product shots.

Funnily enough, I was looking at the Mepatem case and this review confirmed that it's not for me. Too bulky.",SteamDeck

Basically, the information that I as a Deck owner interested in a case want to know. You got a little of this, especially with the modcase, but I'd have liked it for the other ones too.",SteamDeck
jh54zde,"Thanks. Only watched the first 2 for now but I'll resume watching later, that might be useful",SteamDeck
jh4xk61,"Thanks for the comments! A little inside info, I put some tape down on the table so we knew where to put the items in the frame, but we kept moving the table over and tape was in the shot. Because of that, I had to crop the top-down shots way closer than intended.",SteamDeck

jh6glan,"What country, how much and how you did it? I'm thinking about doing it myself",SteamDeck
jh6hrbt,"I'm from Brazil and also had to jump through some hoops to get one. 

I find it totally worth it - I would actually call it my favorite tech purchase ever. That being said... There is the chance of hardware issues (GPU crash, bumper issues, fan issues, power IC issues) and the RMA process will be a nightmare:  they do not receive units or ship to countries without official sales, so you'd need to pay a third party, send it to them, open the RMA, have them receive the device, and have them send it back. 

So keep that in mind. Also check which parts you could easily import if needed, iFixit changed their shipping policies and stopped shipping to some countries, and batteries are extremely restrictive due to airspace regulations.",SteamDeck

I finished the main story, and now I'm just constantly playing through it over and over again to see what happens next, and seeing the characters grow and develop is so satisfying.  Not to mention the dungeons and enemy layouts alwaya change every run, and there are several challenges that keep you busy and to test your level of skill.

Don't worry about losing in the beginning because Hades encourages this.  Every run you fail at in the beginning will make you stronger and stronger until you are able to make it to the end with ease.",SteamDeck

As a matter of fact, that's the only way you can upgrade your equipment and abilities and do better. You *have to* fail continuously in order to get a little bit farther each time.

I want to play games where I can advance on my own skill, not games where you're so weak, you're expected to lose over and over until you've finally built up enough skills, weapons, and abilities to progress to the next level. This game is literal hell for a player like me.",SteamDeck

jh3nyp9,"not sure where the term comes from. but it basically is the gameplay mechanic of doing “runs” trying to play through the whole game/section without dying. once you lose you lose all the loot/power ups and restart from the beginning. 

there are a lot of variations of this though. some let you keep certain upgrades and you continue to power up as you progress. 

there are also games referred as “rogue-lite” which is basically a less forgiving version of this. with more checkpoints and things you keep during runs. 

it’s a really popular gameplay loop currently and it is fun. very challenging but rewarding at the same time. 

great games i love in this genre recently off the top of my head are hades, returnal, rogue legacy, dead cells, slay the spire, spelunky, the binding of isaac, cult of the lamb, and risk of rain.",SteamDeck
jh4b447,"Rogue**like** means a game where if you die you have to start over with nothing. Think of Tetris or Chess or a card game. You have no ""progression"", every match you start with nothing.

Rogue**lite** means a game where you get reset to level 1 after dying, but there is still *some* progression between matches. Usually you unlock permanent upgrades or unlock new weapons between runs, but you still have to restart back at first level everytime you die.


____

Hades is the latter. You unlock upgrades and new weapons, but if you die on the fourth level you are sent back to the start of level one to start over. Only you have new upgrades now...",SteamDeck

jh3y0pu,"Actually by the strictest definition, “roguelike” refers to games patterned closely after the original Rogue, which uses ASCII style graphics and is turn based. While “roguelite” also stems from that same wheelhouse, but with a much looser implementation that allows for arcadey genres or real time action, and not ASCII graphics.

In practice however, people use the two terms pretty interchangeably.",SteamDeck
jh511j5,"Ohh,  nice explanation. Definitely Roguelite",SteamDeck
jh450iy,"**[Roguelike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)** 
 
 >Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing computer games traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Though Beneath Apple Manor predates it, the 1980 game Rogue, which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator, is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring Rogue's character- or sprite-based graphics.

Its actually better as an offensive boon than a defensive boon and doesnt really improve defense in any really meaningful way.

jh68wgy,"do what people like DIY\_PAPI did and cut a vertical strip off the backplates thermal pad so it doesnt obstruct the airflow of the aluminium heatsink on the deck, you can see the indentation on the left of the heatsink which the thermal pad partially blocks.

Also as you have mentioned, yes the backplate doesnt shift heat away from the deck, it acts like a sponge so it just takes longer to heat up, but once saturated your back to square one without the means to shift the heat away.

That just means slapping a fan to the backplate so you can indeed shift some heat away.  a decent option is to buy something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/StarTech-com-85x70x50mm-Socket-Heatsink-Connector-Black/dp/B00006B8EK/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3OIMZY3IAID3H&keywords=60mm%2Bfan%2Bheatsink&qid=1681076148&sprefix=60mm%2Bfan%2Bheatsink%2Caps%2C71&sr=8-5&th=1) which is a copper heatsink with screwholes for a 60mm fan, the size means unlike a 40mm fan some others use, the 60mm one will cover the whole plate on the jsaux backplate, you just need to stick a 2-3mm thermal pad between the two so you have room between the backplate and the copper/fan so you can put an epoxy glue between the two to hold them together.

That copper sink+fan combo i linked uses a 12v fan, just replace this with something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Noctua-NF-A6x25-Premium-Quiet-Version/dp/B01G20CHX4) which is doable as that copper block has screwholes for fans, there are 3-4pin fan header to usb converter cables that all seem to be 5volt only which you can power from a dock or a very small usb power bank whose only job is to power the fan.

Again the backplate isnt much use apart from the looks if you arent sticking a cooling solution to the backplate, and a bare minimum if not the above suggestion is a small fan of some kind.",SteamDeck
jh6h9sy,"PTM7950 works very well on the Deck. 

The JSAUX backplate definitely helps but eventually you’ll reach a point where the heatsink can’t get rid of more heat without the help of an extra fan.

jh4y5hn,The easiest and safest way whould be to limit your tdp to 10w and refresh rate to 40hz. It shouldn't impact the performance that much since the APU is less energy efficient on the higher tdp (it uses more power for less performance),SteamDeck

jh6cb86,"the important part, esp watching DIY\_PAPI's videos is regarding the heatsink, and what he did to cut part of the thermal pad so the airflow valve intended isnt blocked, he has 1-2 vids showing this, just a case of searching his vids for ""JSAUX BACKPLATE"" and watching the relevant vids, he also re-uses the cut off thermal pad portion to stick to the decks thermal pipe to allow heat from that to move into the heatshield, which then goes into the jsaux backplate.

The part where you can differ is what to do after that, basically the actual cooling portion, some use peltier coolers, tho they are power hungry and typically cool down the most in an area the deck doesnt get the most hot so the effect is lowered, the best still seems to be a chunk of copper and a bog standard fan from what ive been watching, there are better solutions, but some require more indepth work i myself am unqualified or simply scared to attempt or end up being much more expensive and might require 3d printed parts and from the case of the ""CoolDeck"" project, a custom made copper metal construct which replaces the heatshield.

I just went for the simple route, a small chunk of copper that has screwholes for a fan with an alternate 5volt replacement fan, nice and simple...   How effective will it be?  probably not amazing but better than nothing.

Also remember not to just look at temperatures when looking at stats, also look at the cpu/gpu clock speeds, remember the deck by default IF running a game that taxes it will draw all it can to get performance it needs, if you slap on a cooling solution, your deck WILL get cooler, and the deck will respond by upping the cpu/gpu clock speeds to get more of what it needs, which in turns heats things up again.

So this means if you benchmark your games, always leave a game running for quite a while and monitor the temps AND the clock speeds/frequency, rather than laser focusing on just the temps and maybe fps.",SteamDeck

Once I finally got one long after I wanted one, there are so many damn rules and regulations just to fly the damn thing, it’s a hassle just to get up in the air without catching shit from some Karen or some cop in my area who thinks he’s more important than he is…

Plus, the batteries don’t seem to last as long as the larger ones which is fine cause I just bought a bunch extra.

But the big issue is since I’ve gotten the drone, we have moved…now I live within eyesight of an airport and can’t lift off PERIOD unless I drive ten miles to someplace else…which means I would have to make a day trip to a park or something just to use it…and for something like that, I’d rather just spend the day walking my dogs…",SteamDeck

linux desktop: same steps (easier in fact) for oversteer, but ... the clutch pedal still doesn't work, my 1440p monitor doesn't work (unrelated to wheel), and the force feedback is a random bucking bronco trying to constantly throw me off bridges and cliffs and shit.

Cassette Beasts is also releasing next week, it has a bit of a different spin on the Pokémon formula, there's a demo you can try on Steam. Maybe also Patch Quest? Though it made me think more of Pokémon Ranger since you have to run circles around monsters to catch em!",SteamDeck
jh1o6s7,That’s Warside. Probably the closest looking to Advance Wars. It’s out later this year (Q3) but the devs have implied Steam Deck will be supported.,SteamDeck
jh4sxpx,"Never heard of Advanced Wars or Wargroove.

I think my adblocker is blocking OP's video, and comments say it's for the Switch, so... not looking into AW too much. But Wargroove looks interesting.

I'm not entirely sure yet how it's different from games like Halcyon 6, Jack Move, or Star Renegades... but it's on my wishlist now.",SteamDeck

jh23rqz,"Symphony of War hooked me massively which is something Wargroove never did, the game also feels more mature and the gameplay is excellent.
I’ve played for about 52 hours and finished the campaign twice. (Once on normal mode and the second play through was on the highest difficulty)",SteamDeck
jh4l4ot,"Very good, you are playing on a emulator",SteamDeck
jh27myh,"Do you have any tips?  I've played fire emblem, advance wars, and plenty other strategy games but for some reason I suck at Symphony of War?  I got like 5 hours in and kept getting wrecked.  Need to give it another go but its been a few months.",SteamDeck
jh2b86k,"My first question would be: 
Do you have permadeath enabled? Having that on makes the game a whole lot harder. 
I’ve also played Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, Wargroove and tons of SD Gundam/Super Robot War games and I don’t think the ‘base’ difficulty is much higher.

One thing I’d strongly recommend is to be mindful of both terrain and weather. 
Some of the firearm squads can be overwhelming but rain will reduce their damage as will forest/mountain/swamps. 

Assassins are also very useful in this game as you can use them to ambush from the aforementioned tiles and if you give them some dodge rate % artifacts they can even be used as ‘tanks’.
For some reason the AI loves going for assassins with ranged units and their hit rate is fairly low.

The ability to shuffle can also be very useful if you think that your troops won’t be able to withstand an(other) attack, I’d quite often use the terrain to my advantage blocking off the AI by holding bridges and then using shuffle to save units that would otherwise get destroyed. 
Quite often you’d also have a base/castle close to a bridge and if you place ranged units there you can attack 2 (or 3 with bowman) tiles behind the archers while your other units hold the bridge. 
This would likely also result in the AI using ranged enemies to hit your ranged troops but they’d get a good amount of extra defense from being on a castle/base tile. 

Generally I’ve found myself focusing on a few things: 
- Cavalry (they’re OP), namely a combination of knights and valkyries led by Barnabas 
- Jules’ ranged unit, get them to bowmen, don’t bother getting a healer for them
- Main protagonists unit, one healer, 2 sentinels, a blademaster or zweihander with a red mage and sorceress (siren)

I’d put most of my resources towards these troops and where possible I’d get them to capture objectives to increase their leader stat which allows you to add more units to that squad. 

The biggest thing though is quite honestly the arena, I recommend doing only silver arenas which gives you the best rewards on average. 
Sell the EXP and CP scrolls and buy artifacts to strengthen your troops. (Or hope you get lucky with the arena rewards) 
The arena is what makes the game a lot easier than some other games, it’s quick and easy to do and if you get lucky you can get game changing artifacts.

Also, try and buy units whenever you can (do look at their stats/skills obviously), the bazaars also offer some really good units. 

In terms of the talent tree, try and focus on the left and middle trees while also going for more HP/armor for cavalry and work toward increasing everyone’s unit capacity by 10. (You need the left and middle tree to unlock that)

Advanced tactics can also be quite useful though I didn’t really use them as much on my second play through. 

I’m half tempted to start playing the game again now, it’s just so damn good.",SteamDeck

I've found myself 10ft deep, in a 5ft tall pile of shit, cause I'm stuck poking a stick at jumping baby monsters, tall finger monsters and crawlers for almost 1hr30mins, and it doesn't help that the only light source I have is damn dim black light emitting electric lighter in a pitch black cave.

jgx0ryc,"I had the same question after looking at the Steam Store page, watching the videos, etc.

I took a gamble and bought it. Hated the first 30-60 minutes of the game because I didn’t get how to play. I didn’t understand why it was so hard and why the only input was movement.

I asked a friend who has played for awhile about the game, and I read some advice on Reddit, and I finally got it.

The game is supposed to be hard and feel limiting at the beginning. Very quickly though, you can start unlocking power-ups, and each power-up makes the following game run more fun.

As you begin to unlock more power-ups by buying them with the gold you earn during runs, you also begin to unlock other things - new characters with different abilities and stats, new and mysterious items, new and gratuitously fun new weapons, and more.

And the game usually tells you what you haven’t unlocked yet and how to unlock it, allowing you to set specific goals. Like recently, I wanted to unlock something that required evolving six weapons during a single run to unlock. Evolving six weapons can’t be done in a 15-minute run (at least I can’t do it), so I knew it was going to take a 30-minute run.

I had to try out different strategies to accomplish this goal. I failed many times before I succeeded. Which stage should I play to maximize my chances of evolving the six weapons? Which six weapons should I evolve? But most importantly, which character should I choose who will stand the best chance of evolving six weapons?

It was incredibly rewarding to finally evolve the six weapons after finding out the perfect combination of stage, weapons, and character that fit my play style.

For me, the game is about pursuing the unlocks.",SteamDeck

jgwzhlr,"I think it's the challenge of seeing how long you can last in a map. Every time you play, you figure out a different technique to use. 

The game is simple in mechanics. Move your character around and try not to get over run with enemies. Every enemy you kill drops XP that you collect and use to upgrade your projectiles(weapons) to shoot more or faster , unlock new projectiles, or increase player health and defense. 

It feels good to upgrade your character to the max and just mow down enemies like a hot knife through butter, haha.",SteamDeck

The developer worked for years with online casino software, he knows exactly how to hook you in: the sound design, the chests, the random chance of extra lucky chests, the animations, the sound effect like a roulette while the items roll, the huge damage numbers and the pretty colors - it's designed to deeply get you hooked.

jgyeopr,I assumed the same but it's extremely comfy! The pads work incredibly well as substitute for mouse and keyboard. I'm also using them for Witcher EE and I find it very comfortable too. Icewind Dale is verified as optimized for Deck but I haven't tried that yet. I'll probably replay it after BG2.,SteamDeck

jgwicn2,"Not great. I often go back to mouse and keyboard. But it is completely doable after some tinkering. Remember that factorio released on the switch, that has less buttons than the deck",SteamDeck
jgx1xmo,"I had to do a lot of tinkering, but got it to a good spot where it felt smart for me. Also to note, I'm running the Space Exploration mod, so there's even more keyboard shortcuts. I'm at a pretty decently large base size, and so far, it's running smooth with zero problems for me. It's become my favorite plane ride activity",SteamDeck
jgxifu0,"I actually super enjoy the default controls on deck! A bit of tweaking to your preference and it's very enjoyable! Sometimes even preferable! The GUI scaling is the toughest bit, but there's been talk from devs of updates for that soon!",SteamDeck

I used one of the ones with the most community time 
(make sure you choose a Steam Deck input not a Steam Controller input) and then changed them to work for me. You might be able to see it, named something like 'Drekly's config' or however it names them.

jgxlq7g,The track pads work quite well instead of a mouse,SteamDeck
jgy2b7d,I always used a Steam controller for it except for raids and detailed building. For those I would move to m&kb,SteamDeck
jgyaq47,It takes time especially coming from kb/m but I've done over 100 hours on the deck now and it felt pretty comfortable early on.  I found a custom layout and modified it even more to my liking as the official one doesn't let you change pawns with a click I believe.  Left track pad for movement works really well and the right one setup as a wheel for even more shortcuts.  It gets really good battery life and is now my usual go to for gaming on the couch.,SteamDeck
jgwjctd,You win by uninstalling,SteamDeck
jgxls05,"It runs fine, though I'm not terribly picky as long as it's not choppy and is playable. The only time I've felt that performance was an issue was when lots of buildings were being destroyed and I was in the middle of it. I haven't played a ton on my Deck yet though so that could change as I encounter different weather effects and more enemies.

Edit: I also haven't done a single thing to change graphics settings or steam deck performance settings. So this has been my experience on whatever the defaults are for the game.",SteamDeck
jgxfpm5,"It is way more objective oriented. Like to progress the story toy need to do x, then y, then z. But to do x, you need a,b, and c. 

I loved it tbh, if you liked the community center in sv, grinding to get things, then you will prob like it. It also has a goofy story and dialog. I think I put in about 25 hours and beat the story plus some extras. 

Right now, I'm looking for my next sv or graveyard keeper game. I might just play those, but hopefully I find another one.",SteamDeck
jgx3ouw,It's almost like valve knew we would spend tons of money on games we don't play. Lmfao.,SteamDeck

I hope to beat hardcore eventually, but I just get too greedy and get hit by a killing spell like ice or the lightning.",SteamDeck
jgwi6o1,Turn off the push feature on the track pad and you would think the game is designed specifically for the deck. Play anywhere for any amount of time set it down then pick it up and in 5 seconds you are right where you left it. Play on the 11 settings and you get 3- 5 hours on battery,SteamDeck

jgxkwjg,"Personally, I think this game goes way to hard on the non-combat ""gameplay"". The ratio is way off. For every combat mission you do that takes 20 minutes or less, there's like 1 - 2 hours of walking around the abbey, upgrading cards, talking to characters, building friendships, etc.

jgwv6gd,"My game is crazy modded, like 200 mods or something. It doesn’t crash much. It definitely takes me out of it when it does and I’m like “oh shit how long have I been playing for?”",SteamDeck
jgxc0mu,"On the go, I have to use the pads mixed with the touch screen. With it being turn-based combat and RPG-style interactions with dialog choices everywhere the only time it really becomes an issue is moving around the map which is a click-and-move style system similar to Mount and Blade. Ideally, I like to dock the deck and use a mouse and keyboard on my couch while using my Nreal Airs. I have been able to play it on the go just fine without all the extras though, just a tad bit slower personally for me using the trackpads as I am not as used to them as I am mouse and keyboard. It runs perfectly on the deck since the game is fairly optimized and not very graphically demanding. If it gets official controller support at some point it would be perfect.",SteamDeck

As a Brazilian born in the 90's, a huge portion of my childhood was paying $10 for a bucket (yes, a bucket) of bootleg PS2 discs - so many games, so cheap... Yet I would play for 15 minutes and drop them. If you have 10 games and you didn't pay or had to go through any effort for them, any minor inconvenience is enough to give up. 

Same thing with a hacked Vita or 3DS - games you would explore every centimeter of the world had you paid full price now don't have any weight  they just kinda live on your home screen after you spent your time downloading and setting things up, and that's it.

jgyyjvs,All that casino crack but no microtransactions. There is a paid DLC but it's as cheap as the game and totally worth it too.,SteamDeck
jgxgch7,"Seconded. I actually just factory reset my Steam Deck because I wanted a fresh start. Installed CryoUtilities, installed EmuDeck, downloaded Vampire Survivors, Mass Effect LE, Windwaker HD, and that’s it. Started Mass Effect 2 again and I’m having a blast; it runs beautifully. Vampire Survivors when I need a break from thinking about anything. Not installing or buying anything else til I finish WWHD and ME2…by which time Tears of the Kingdom will probably be here, so there goes May and June",SteamDeck
jgyldl5,"That's interesting. Personally I thought the first couple hours were slow, story wise. Maybe it slows down again, I'm only ~5 hours in right now. But to be fair, 4 hours and 55 minutes of those have been me just fishing to get money, to upgrade stuff.

jgwsrot,I actually think the controls are very well done for Factorio.,SteamDeck
jgymi29,"I still don't understand why devs don't add controller support to PC games that.... already have controller support on console. I agree, the game doesn't control great on Deck. *Maybe* if I had a desktop to play on and get used to controls to know which key does what, I could find/map a decent button map, but I don't. Having to stop every couple of minutes to look at the key binding in game, and then check Steam Input, before resuming the game kinda bumped me off of the game. 

Same thing with Satisfactory. Although with that game, I did feel like I had a fair grasp on things and quite enjoyed it. But I didn't play for a week, came back, and couldn't remember half of the bindings. I haven't touched it since. I know Satisfactory isn't on console, but fortunately the devs have said when 1.0 releases they'll have full controller support. They said every update that adds stuff would require them to redo their controller code, so that's why it's not there yet? Hopefully that's true and they do eventually add it.",SteamDeck

jgzbaeo,"It's just a very good gameplay loop.  You start a run, you get lots of options to do a variety of pretty different playstyles (and incentives to actually try them all out instead of falling back on the one you know works best), and then when you win or die you go back and get more of the story and character inteeractions and base upgrades and all that other stuff so you don't feel particularly frustrated you lost.  It's just an opportunity to do all this other stuff you were excited to get to do anyways, and then you go back and do another run (now with a different weapon 'cause it gives you a bonus because you haven't used it recently) and you know you gotta improve your relationship with Hermes some more so you decide to go for his upgrades when you can and well you haven't tried *this* combo yet so let's go for it, and so on.

Supergiant has never done a direct sequel to a game before, so Hades 2 being in development speaks to just how much they struck gold with that basic premise.  Like, really only Pyre is fundamentally different from their other games, Bastion, Transistor, and Hades are all essentially the same premise of ""isometric action RPG with direct WASD control (not Diablo mouse-only control) with story-based incentives to try out every possible weapon and combination to keep the gameplay novel throughout"" but specifically Hades's roguelite loop is what takes it from these indie darlings to something nearly everyone has to admit is genius.",SteamDeck
jgyqbk0,"For me the previous game by this developer, transistor, is right up alongside. Not rogue-like, but built from a lot of similar ideas and systems, and an unbelievably cool and weird story.

jh2xr8k,"\> What are the big benefits of using Lutris vs adding non steam games to library and running with proton or installing their launcher inside gaming mode?

How do you install the game in the first place?

For many people the answer to that is Lutris. Lutris is one of the ways to easily install non-native games on Linux by wrapping each installer in a script that takes care of all the little things you need to configure yourself for a game to work if you were to set up a game through WINE on your own.

If you already have a different way to install and configure a game or its launcher (e.g. Heroic, individual installer scripts, native binaries, or you're simply handy with WINE), I don't think Lutris provides much additional utility if you don't intend to use it as a launcher (which you won't on Deck, obviously). I don't exactly have a ton of experience with it, but FWIW I've found in the past that Heroic and Lutris have different degrees of success installing different games, and I've also had success (on a Linux laptop, not Steam Deck) installing some games through Lutris that I failed to install myself with a standalone installer script wrapper.",SteamDeck

jh4vpoe,"Look, the steam wallet isnt a bank or payment platform.

Im not familiar with the issues regarding digital item sales, but my impression has been that it's not bad. There's other things they could do to make it better like a UI that lets you sell multiple items easier. 

I could be convinced otherwise on the digital item sales, but what OP is talking about is totally different. As far as I understand, OP bought a physical item from Steam and returned it. Valve has essentially denied the return; they only transformed the purchase from one type to another instead of doing a refund.

This encourages OP to buy the deck again and then sell it on ebay or something, instead of it being handled by Valve. This makes shady sales on ebay seem more legitimate and/or devaluing OPs money. 

Denying uses of the Steam wallet in particular ways for digital transactions, on the other hand is done to protect the digital marketplace from bots and such.

jh5chmb,"There are several options for an NVME upgrade, so I ask that you please don't overpay for an SSD.    

You can get the [Micron 2TB Drive](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR99P.shtml&order_id=323669245&sitem=B09WR99#Availability)  straight from a US distributor for $158. The same price as the [1TB Inland TN446](https://www.microcenter.com/product/663766/inland-tn446-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck). 
The closest *available* option to this is the 2TB SN740 from AliExpress for $160+ but it's a risk and you won't have a warranty if you're within the US. The Micron 2TB has also been listed on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/micron-2tb-2400-series/p/0D9-0022-000N1?Item=0D9-0022-000N1) for $160 but is out of stock and they have cancelled many orders from those that were able to place them when it came in stock earlier this week...

Alternatively, if that's out of your price range you can buy the [1TB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01112_B09WR98P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!#Availability) for $89.  Comparatively, the [1TB Sabrent Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) sells for $160 on Amazon. And if you're fortunate enough to live near a Microcenter, they also sell their [1TB Inland TN346](https://www.microcenter.com/product/649991/inland-tn436-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck) for around $130.  

A lot of people find the convenience of going to Microcenter to purchase and exchange/swap the SSD *if* it ever fails much more valuable than the extra storage space and that's fine, but I would personally rather have double the storage and a new backplate for the same price or less than either of the 1TB Inland Drives.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, but the Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300.

jgxk01q,"I actually had this issue for a month or two. The Steam Deck could connect to the internet, but the connection to the Steam Servers would continue to drop. I tried everything I could think of including the wifi setting in the developer options. No amount of tweaks to the Wifi networks would help, and it occurred over usbc/ethernet as well. It started shortly after my brother moved back in but I never made the connection. I finally dug around in my router and figured it out. 

Turns out, my brother manually set static IPs on his personal devices (phone, pc, etc). There's nothing wrong with this on the face of it. However, the IPs weren't designated on the Router so the router didn't know that they were taken and assigned his phone's ip to me Steam Deck. This meant they were both fighting for traffic and the Deck kept dropping connection.

To fix it, I just went in and manually assigned an Ip to my Deck in the Routers DHCP reservations to something different and reset everything. This way, he can keep his phone setup and my Deck would get a different IP every time. Haven't had any problems since then.

This issue may also arise from sleep mode too. Before the Deck goes to sleep, it's assigned one IP. When asleep it's not connecting anymore. Depending on how long it's asleep, the router could end up giving that IP to another device in the meantime. When you wake up the Deck, it's still trying to communicate with the same IP as before and now there's a routing conflict. Just a theory.

The best thing to do is to go ahead and set a manual ip in your router for the Deck. I already had most of my other devices (NAS, PC, Server, etc)manually assigned, but just didn't think about the Deck as an important network device until then.",SteamDeck

-	Disabled power management in developer settings
-	Forced wlan0 on the network in desktop mode
-	Done the DNS thing in resolv.conf

-	Forced 2.4GHz

jgx8gim,"This worked for me up to a point. For anyone else still having the issue: it seems to primarily be caused by sleep/wake.

The Steam Deck will try to suspend (temp turn off) the wifi chip when you sleep the device. When it wakes back up, it may still have old data/certificates and may not be updating them properly, but this is an educated guess on my part and hasn't been confirmed.

My solution is at the end of the evening when I put my Deck away for the night, I select ""shutdown"" from the power menu.

This device had some weird version of 5Ghz that my steamdeck couldn’t handle. I think it was a channel width issue. 
So, on some routers you can use more channels for a single wifi ssid that increases speed by using more bandwidth. Once I eliminated that thing from my house altogether, the steamdeck started working great and I haven’t had a single issue since.

jh2h6ye,Great it worked for me tio!!,SteamDeck
jgxtn8b,"It sounds like maybe the Steam Deck may be trying to “keep” the same IP after the router thinks it’s connection has dropped and re-assigned it to another device

This would make sense with the fact it seems it can sometimes be fixed by disabling WiFi power saving - my guess is that the Deck is not sending WiFi keep alive packets often enough to maintain the connection with the router (the router figures its offline) but the deck doesn’t realise that it needs to request a new IP. Disabling WiFi power saving presumably makes this *less* likely to happen (but doesn’t rule it out entirely)",SteamDeck
jgxwrrb,"Also work downloading an app like [Wifi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=abdelrahman.wifianalyzerpro&hl=en_GB&gl=US) to your phone and ensuring your router isnt broadcasting on a really clogged band (with other devices or neighbours routers).

jgy0x10,"Yeah I bought a new wifi router myself about 2 months ago..when I got my Steam Deck this happened alot.  It was a Netgear Nighthawk CAX30-100NAR.

I double checked all of my settings and ended up returning it because it was really freaking annoying.  Back to my old router which works good, it just isn't WIFI6 like I wanted.",SteamDeck
jgxyanl,"If i ever turn offline mode on, it wont turn back off for me without restarting",SteamDeck
jgz3thm,"This is correct. If you don't know what you're doing, you could make things worse. Manually assigning a static IP and setting a DHCP reservation are not the same thing. It's best to check your router and devices to confirm the issue before making any changes.

This was only an issue for me because another device was manually set on the device end without my (the network admin) knowledge. I also have a pihole on my local network running as the primary DNS server, which my brother was also bypassing by setting up the ip and DNS settings on his devices. This may also have contributed to the issue, and using a DHCP reservation in my router for my Deck was a nice middle ground for our specific usecase.",SteamDeck

Right, and the thing to do in such cases is to give it a manual IP _outside_ the DHCP range.",SteamDeck
jgxlyik,"Agreed. This is more of a networking issue than Wifi. Unfortunately, most people also still use the wireless gateway provided by their ISP, which usually locks down a lot of the more advanced networking options. Beyond getting a personal router, they won't even be able to reserve IPs through the router even if they knew how.

My best guess is that this is somehow related to the way they suspend the sessions on the Deck, but everyone is too focused on the ""Wifi"" portion and not the overall network.",SteamDeck
jgy4umr,"There may be an IP conflict then. If you have the Eeros, you should be able to go into the **Reservations & Port Forwarding** settings and reserve an IP for your Deck. Reddit is weird about posting links, but you can google "" How to Set Static IP Addresses on Your Eero Router"" and you should find some picture guides with the steps to do so. You will probably have to restart your Eeros and the Deck for it to go into effect, but you can try that.

jgzlf3n,[deleted],SteamDeck
jh40cff,You're missing what is going on. The Deck is loosing the connection and DHCP is reassigning the IP to something else. The Deck can no longer connect because it's causing an IP conflict.

jh1p1u3,Oh ok thanks,SteamDeck
jgzwtdl,"Yup, at some point they send a guy two new Decks to test stuff on - poor guy had to send them back after - and we’re no closer. 

Awhile back Valve had people on the forum run some more testing to try and find what everyone had in common but we haven’t heard back on that one.

All we know is that there’s two “versions” of the bug and that certain workarounds only work for some users and not others - even when they’re issues appear identical. The power-saver mode toggle has the highest success rate. 

What’s also puzzling is that the Deck is totally stable for some users in Desktop mode and won’t drop at all, just to start having connection issues again in Game mode.

Oh, and the other weird phenomenon we’ve noticed, is that some people have weird “honeymoon periods” where everything will work fine for a week or two and then start failing again.",SteamDeck

jh4zbxv,"IIRC you can only set up a static IP address on the device if you aren't using DHCP, which pretty much everyone is using nowadays.",SteamDeck
jh410va,"You're making a false assumption. Disabling IPv6 would only work if the Deck was already assigned to an IPv6 address. By doing so, it forces DHCP to provision another IP to the device and renews the network connection. It will fail again in due time when the Deck fails to keep the connection alive and DHCP releases the IP. All you did was force a release/renew cycle and reestablish the network connection in a very roundabout way.",SteamDeck
jh2dnt9,It depends on your router. You'll have to do a search.,SteamDeck
jh3115g,This is incorrect information,SteamDeck
jh6h6kc,"Yes, and routers with IPv6 also assign IPv6 addresses to devices along with IPv4 addresses. A look at the client table will demonstrate that. If knocking out IPv6 ""fixed"" it, that's because it forced the Deck to request a new IP, which would fall back to IPv4 due to IPv6 being disabled.

If I'm wrong, then explain to me how disabling IPv6 solves the problem.",SteamDeck
jh6iv6w,"I can't reply to comments that are nested under someone who has blocked me. So I'll reply to you here instead:

DHCP isn't infallible. It will fail when faced with a case it has no rule for. I fix things people break all the time. I know that relying on DHCP as if it's some flawless deity is a big mistake. If you can't fix the device directly, you make a new rule that bypasses it. Breaking the device more so it can't use IPv6 *anywhere* is a bad solution. Also, it's not a fix. It just forced an IP renewal. Binding an IP to the MAC address is better than turning off an entire address protocol. IPv4 has 65536 private IP's. IPv6 has 2\^64 total addresses. There are plenty of IP's to bind on a private home network. Forcing a release/renewal is better than turning an entire address protocol. Disabling an address protocol is a bad fix. Don't assume DHCP is always going to work.",SteamDeck

If you're saying that the deck, upon wakeup, holds its last IP until the system realizes that it needs to release it and get another - well yeah that's how it's suppose to work. 

If the problem is that it takes too long, and you want the deck to always have the correct address, assign it a DHCP reservation in your DHCP server, don't manually configure its IP address on the device at all.",SteamDeck

One that says unable to connect to steam servers and one below it saying unable to connect to the internet. While I’m sure they’re possibly agnostic of one another, a majority of the time this is because of a network issue caused by the deck going to sleep and losing its assigned IP. 

My example was a super watered down version but as a network admin, it definitely has to do with the assigned IP which almost always meant no internet connection on top of being unable to connect to a specific verification server (whether steam, windows, etc). Thank God were not having to modify host files anymore!!",SteamDeck
jgxkfeh,"I'd be interested (genuinely) in seeing that data.

I'm being 100% serious and not condescending.",SteamDeck
jh53uz6,"Yes, that is correct. You can choose between DHCP and a static ip address on your devices. And that is all you have to do, no need to change DHCP settings on your router. If you still prefer DHCP, but want the device to always get the same address, you can configure that on your router.

Wouldn't be that sure about DHCP in general. I mean yes, the everyday consumer doesn't bother with it but for instance I like to have a static ip address for some of my devices, especially things like NAS. In fact, it's sometimes even needed. :)",SteamDeck

Mine didn't have anything to do with the assigned IP, though - I have IPv6 disabled on most of my internal network (long story revolving around not using AT&T's gateway but having fiber...the best way to keep it stable for long periods of time is not using IPv6), including the network the Deck is connected to.

If you’re in an environment you can somewhat control for outside interference, a decent access point in an unsaturated area can push 600m on 802.11n/2.4ghz@40MHz. The average consumer in the US has a whopping 198m/23m circuit so for the most part consumers are not going to see the 2.4ghz band as “slower”, the opposite is more likely due to how often home networks are deployed with 1 AP for the entire house.",SteamDeck

Check if you have tdp , or gpu clock limit active,  i'd recommend you to follow the cryoutilities tutorial, along with the undervolting and overclocking tutorial if you feel comfortbale doing that last, but a slight overclock won't hurt the system and can improve stability, Nicea part is that with the plugin powertools you can manage everything,  so you can set the performance as if it was stock in a few seconds while playing",SteamDeck

4. Choose \`select the default wineprefix\`

jh4ig9l,Mine came with no battery. Are you sure that your deck is fully charged?,SteamDeck

I’m on my second RMA now, the first RMA took three days to approve, the second RMA one day.",SteamDeck
jh5pd7j,Second already? What happened with yours?,SteamDeck
jh63iqr,"Both had multiple issues.

Deck Number 1: Rattling Fan on low RPM, right stick made a crunchy sound when moving, trackpad haptics uneven (left side barely had any haptics), L1 button was really wobbly (it felt like it's about to fall off) and needed more force to press down.

Deck Number 2: Rattling Fan on low RPM, Volume buttons were really wobbly and sometimes didn’t register a click, the L2 Button scratched against the shell which made it feel like shit.

The Support was really good and on the second RMA they sent an RMA Label with no questions asked, but damn, there are definitely some quality control issues. I never had to RMA an Item twice. I just hope that the 3rd deck is flawless.",SteamDeck
jh644zm,"Wow, that’s ridiculous. Having to send your steam deck twice. I know i’ve been reading around and you aren’t the only person who has sent their team deck in twice.

jgzqnl5,"Death Stranding is a weird one. While anyone calling it a walking simulator isn’t really wrong, it still feels like a super reductive hot take since the game has so much going for it as far as story, stealth, and combat. It’s also nice to play something that not only tries to be different but succeeds at it.",SteamDeck
jgzsqp9,"There's a Humble Monthly thing where you pay £12 (just cancel straight after if you want and keep the games) and get a bunch of games, one of which is Death Stranding this month

I'm about 4 hours into it, also a big MGS fan. The setting is intriguing full marks there, though the story so far as dragged a little, especially dialogue. Nothing ruinous it's just a little pretentious but I'm interested to see how the story plays out and gets paid off.

As for the gameplay, so far I like it. I was really in the mood for some game focused on traversal where the goal is to just to get to a point on the map and this is scratching that itch. Planning out your journey around the terrain and which equipment to take with you is fun. Aside from moments of action/stealth its a mostly chill experience which I'm enjoying but can understand may not be everyone's cup of tea.

I think it's really depend on what mindset you have going in, what you're expecting, what kind of mood you're in. It's defiitely not a walking simulator though, there are genuine gameplay considerations based around the traversal.

TL;DR - It's rough around the edges but enjoyable if you're in the mood for a more laidback game",SteamDeck

I used to have a game buying problem where I would spend hours and hours scrolling and obsessing over the $10 a month I had as a budget for games. Since I've started it I just stop scrolling now because why would I buy a game when I could be getting it in the next months bundle.

jh3w7yz,Yeah that's the one I bought. Is there a significant improvement on the temps tho?,SteamDeck
jh3zbb9,"Some people have reported better temps, but honestly my deck never had overheating issues and always ran good temps. The difference is that now it takes less fan speed to keep acceptable temperatures and is therefore quieter. I would imagine if I had tested with the fan at a constant speed I would notice reduced temperatures, but I didn't bother with that. The PTM7950 is just better at moving heat away from the APU, so it doesn't need to run the fan as high now.",SteamDeck

Black screen crash with the ""abort"" buttons appearing at the bottom means incompatible proton version.  Proton 8.0 does this.  Make sure you actually reboot the Deck after installing the game.

White screen crash is some sort of crash with 3d acceleration and EAC.

You can fix the white crash crash most of the time with the command line PROTON\_NO\_D3D11=1 %Command%, along with changing the proton version (which I think defaults to Proton Experimental).

jh2699s,"All three options you mentioned have their own advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Here's a brief overview of each option:

1. Hero Launcher: Hero Launcher is a relatively new tool specifically designed to make it easier to play games from the Epic Games Store and other stores on Linux systems. It has a user-friendly interface and supports automatic installation of games and updates. However, it's worth noting that Hero Launcher is still in beta, so you may encounter bugs or compatibility issues.

2. Lutris: Lutris is a popular open-source gaming platform that supports a wide range of games, including those from Epic and Origin. It provides a unified interface for managing your game library and can automatically configure wine or other compatibility layers to run games. Lutris has been around for a while and is generally stable, but it does require some manual configuration for some games.

3. Direct installation of Epic and Origin: This option involves installing the Epic Games Store and/or Origin clients directly on your system and running games through them. While this method can work well for some games, it can be more difficult to set up and may require some additional tweaking to get everything working smoothly.

Overall, I would recommend trying out Hero Launcher or Lutris first, as they provide a more streamlined experience and are generally easier to set up. If you run into issues with either of those, you can always try the direct installation method as a backup.",SteamDeck
jh2mz7e,"I have a bunch of games on epic, and for me, cloud transfer was really useful, so I first tried hero. The results were title dependent and for most not good at all. Instead, I just partitioned ssd and installed win and now I use ms games/epic on that partition. But you can try hero and check if you prefer it.

Also, be mindful that if you want to install win, don't do it on microsd as it will not work well, go with an external ssd or internal one.",SteamDeck

jh4gmgd,"Yeah, it's what u/esotericine said about the SteamOS filesystem being set as read-only. You can change that, but SteamOS updates will overwrite whatever you do so it's not worth the hassle right now.

And while you could chroot a lot of things for XAMPP, you need to create users for apache and MySQL and get access to the network layer to respond to the port requests.",SteamDeck
jh4zkp9,"The process would be  
1. set up a password.  `passwd`  
1. ""unlock"" the file system  `sudo steamos-readonly disable`
1.use pacman (arch linux app stor) to install xampp  `sudo pacman -Suy xampp`

jh4hcu7,"imo this is definitely well out of end-user territory.

there's a lot of things the deck is good at, but while it can be treated as a general purpose OS, things get progressively more hassle-shaped the further you get from ""playing steam games"" and this is a fair bit removed from that ideal.

we should ask a different question: is xampp actually required, or just what was asked for because it's a known example of a web server? could vserver or some other flathub hosted package suffice?",SteamDeck

>Totally fine, though it comes with several caveats. Make sure you know what you’re doing and be careful about running random commands / scripts you find on the internet - you may get your Steam Deck into a bad state or compromise your data.

jh1sftw,"Any game that runs on smooth 60fps can be optimized to last 3-4hours.
For example doom 2016/eternal. Set settings to low, in quick settings select 40hz, limit TDP until you see that it starts to drop below 40fps inside a building (outside it will be more demanding), check what gpu clock is set right now(overlay level 4) and save it.
For me 40hz, medium, 8watt 1300Mhz results in 14-16w power consumption which is around or slightly below 3 hr of play time. The same will work in Nier Automata. For Control you need to disable reflection completely. Can go even farther by changing render resolution to 960x540 (need to select 720p as display resolution, otherwise it will only allow you to set 400p or 800p render resolution) which will net you 4 hours of playtime.

Heroes of might and magic 3 can last 6-9 hours. Do not limit fps to 30,it will decrease cpu and gpu power consumption to under 1watt, but the game will be in the slow motion. Better limit TDP to 3w and set gpu clock at 400Mhz, without restricting the fps. It will make the gpu and cpu run under 1w (APU will still use about 3w,since there are other components in it).

Display and Graphics:

AA off,

There will be dips when the game loads planet chunks as you move around and, if you target 25, it will take a while for the game to allow you to land. I would start with 1500 MHz or so. I usually do this on the fly. I might also limit Max GPU clocks but I usually don't. You can even combine the fsr2 from the game with fsr1 from OS and have crazy low rendering resolution.

jh3tpy4,Are you sure that's a Steam Deck issue rather than a ConsolePort issue?,SteamDeck
jh5xiux,Sorry not an answer. But I was wondering how wotlk classic was to get running and also play on the deck? Thanks!,SteamDeck
jh3u7im,"I'm not sure what you mean. I guess I think it's both a Steam Deck and ConsolePort issue. Mostly because when you use ConsolePort on steam deck, you control the mouse cursor with the right track pad. If you just play with an Xbox controller or something, it probably isn't an issue. There's something about the combination that isn't working properly on WoW Classic, but does work fine on WotLK. That's the part I don't understand.",SteamDeck
jh61k3x,"It's really not bad to get it running. I installed [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) in desktop mode, and then added it as a non-steam game. I run the game in Game Mode, not desktop. There are a ton of great guides for doing this part on youtube. Then I installed Curseforge in desktop mode, which has a Linux version. You will definitely need the addons ConsolePort and Immersion.

Once in game, setup and tweaking settings probably took 30 minutes or less, and the game runs flawlessly. It's a lot of fun playing a hunter, other classes may be more difficult the more skills you need to use, but you can easily set up 25 skills with the left and right triggers as modifiers (default). 

If you decide to go for it, let me know if you have any issues and I'm happy to help.

By the way, for Classic Era I figured out that it uses an older API that doesn't have input overlap, which is why I'm having the issue with the mouse cursor not being visible. The game can't take inputs from a gamepad and a mouse simultaneously, whereas WotLK and Retail can. There's basically no fix from what I'm hearing in the ConsolePort discord, which is a bummer. But the game is still playable, just a little annoying to not be able to click things with the trackpad mouse while moving.

Oh, for targeting, I highly recommend mapping ""Tab"" to one of the back buttons. It makes targeting enemies really easy. You do this in the Steam controller settings.",SteamDeck
jh4063k,">I guess I think it's both a Steam Deck and ConsolePort issue. Mostly because when you use ConsolePort on steam deck, you control the mouse cursor with the right track pad.

I mean, is this an issue that only happens on Steam Deck or is this an issue that would happen on desktop as well? In the latter case, you might be better off checking in r/wow

> There's something about the combination that isn't working properly on WoW Classic, but does work fine on WotLK. 

From what I can tell, they're using separate launchers, so it's entirely possible they did something different with mouse steering on the version running classic.",SteamDeck

jh2boii,"Imo you shouldnt have to disable it, the real issue is that Steam's new BPM or Game Mode does not handle offline well especially compared to the client making me think there's functionality in the BPM causing it.

For example, if anyone here has ever used a VPN and tried using Game Mode or BPM, you may or are more likely to experience issues despite the client being seamless in this regard.

Now a VPN is a layer between your connection and your ISP for the tl;dr, this is an abnormality. When BPM detects an abnormality it may delay connecting to Steam or just refuse for a period of time or until Steam is restarted.

Everytime I start BPM with a VPN after the Boot video, it will always show connecting to Steam.. Despite there being plenty of time for an attempt to be made & again this dosen't happen on the regular Client.

So I think Valve needs to tweak or rewrite how BPM/Gamemode deals with connection interuptions or abnormalities.

Every Tuesday there's Steam maintenance that will happen sometime between 5PM-7PM, meaning everyone goes offline briefly.

SteamOS/Client should probably be notifying users that Steam Maintenance is on-going, bc alot of the time people think the issue is with them & make posts like this every tuesday.",SteamDeck

for your education it does absolutely nothing. no matter what you set in the bios the vram will use up to 8GB of ram. people seem to think setting it in bios forces the game to use 4GB which is just so untrue. all it does is locks that ram from being used by the cpu. there is some weird logic that even if a game only needs 2GB of vram as an example that setting 4GB in bios will force it to use 4GB which is just not how it works .go set your vram to 256MB (which is what mines set to so the device can actually make efficient usage of the ram) and you will see games will use the same exact amount of vram as 4GB. do explain to me how 4GB set in bios which is NOT preallocated is any different than 256MB raising dynamically to 4GB?",SteamDeck

- Reviewers were pretty negative about the control layout for Xbox and PC, but the official Steam layout is perfectly fine so far. Touch screen is ace for menu navigation. All that said I am starting to make some tweaks aligned to personal preferences (I hate actions tied to joystick clicks, for instance). 
- If you plan on doing Multiplayer (I was able to join a public match, kill some NPCs _Vampire Survivors_ style and then get murdered by a player, all in very short order), you're going to want to launch in desktop mode first in order to sign into your Microsol account.

Explicitly: it's not a rogue-like with RTS mechanics, it's an RTS first, just with a rogue-like control scheme. So if you're expecting to play a game where you're leading armies instead of directing them from the rear, yeah, you're going to be disappointed.

The most valid criticism I've read is that it feels unfinished. There's no AI skirmishes, no map or level designer (remember, this is the makers of Homeworld we're talking about), and people playing multiplayer are reporting that it's _stupidly_ unbalanced.

If Microsol/Mojang gave BBI enough funding to crank out some BoPs and DLCs, or if they open the game to community development, I think it could be a cult favorite for years to come.

The games you mentioned should not require an internet connection after first setup. You can put Steam into offline mode and turn off the Deck's Wifi.

If you keep your games on micro SD or otherwise back them up to external media, you should not need to have network to re-install them (this is just my common sense speaking, since there are people who swap SD cards - I have not personally tried this). However, I do think in a re-image scenario you would still need at least temporary internet access to log into Steam after re-install. \[There are utility programs (Linux, not Steam Deck specific) that should be able to create a backup image of the entire system (which should include Steam authentication tokens and such) and restore from it in case of issues\]([https://askubuntu.com/questions/19901/how-to-make-a-disk-image-and-restore-from-it-later](https://askubuntu.com/questions/19901/how-to-make-a-disk-image-and-restore-from-it-later)).

However, if you primarily plan on using your Steam Deck indoors or in low-light environments, you may not notice a significant difference in the viewing experience between the standard and the anti-glare etched glass screen.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to purchase the most expensive Steam Deck model should depend on your specific needs and budget. The middle-tier model with the larger SSD may provide enough storage for your needs at a lower cost, and you can always purchase an anti-glare screen protector separately if needed.

The most expensive Steam Deck model, which includes the anti-glare etched glass screen, may be worth it for some users depending on their specific needs and preferences.

jh2i9mb,"I don’t have a steam deck, just started looking into one today.

You can always do what I did with phones and tablets. Buy an anti-glare screen protector.",SteamDeck
jh2o3h7,"Not sure what's best for you but I will share my experience.

I got the 64 GB Steam Deck during the ""recent"" sale and upgraded it with a 2 TB SSD from AliExpress. With tax/shipping and everything I'm in it about $557.61 USD. While I was waiting for the drive to come from wherever it came from I dabbled with a couple 500 GB MicroSD that only cost about $40.

You can install an anti-glare screen protector and use vibrant deck to get the display to look how you want so I don't think it's worth it for the display.

The SSD install went ok. I will say that the Steam Deck has some of the cheapest and most flimsy screws I've ever seen in my life. The heads on two screws were starting to strip and I had to switch to a flat screwdriver that fit in the slots. I would suggest having a good small screwdriver set on hand and not trying to force anything.

USB drives seem to be insanely slow when being used for the recovery image to put Steam OS on the new drive and for dual boot setup. I would suggest getting the cheapest A2 microSD you can find for less than $20.

I will say that playing games off the micro SD was fine. It's not that much slower but with the 64 GB I could fit 0 of my games on it. I also had a ""window's to go"" install on another microSD. I found that the Deck with Windows was perfect for using a pen display and got me away from my computer a bit when editing photos for work. It was annoying to swap the cards all the time to go between windows/steam games and I was worried I'd corrupt or damage the windows microSD and waste expensive software licenses for my art programs. This was the main reason I opted to install a 2TB microSD.

After doing all this I'd say microSD is fine. If you want to upgrade beware of the flimsy screws. I got about 4x the storage for $92 less than the 512 GB model and a little elbow grease.

I've heard that there is either an upcoming or recent update to reduce the size of shaders that would fill up the 64 GB model and I've seen some videos about moving those to MicroSD. So just going with cards will get even better. 

Also, not voiding the warranty may have some value as these devices age and begin to experience stick drift and other problems.",SteamDeck
jh30uhb,I bought the 512 because I did not want to open my unit.  I helped fix my son’s when he got his with a paddle issue. Rather easy to change out the drive.

Installing SteamOS on your PC or laptop can provide a similar gaming experience to what you've seen on the Steam Deck, with a customized interface designed for gaming and easy access to your Steam library. However, it's worth noting that SteamOS is designed primarily for gaming, and may not be as user-friendly as other Linux distributions for general-purpose computing tasks.


Basically:
If you're intimidated by Linux, you might want to consider trying a user-friendly distribution like Ubuntu, Mint, or Pop!_OS, which offer a more familiar desktop environment and a larger community of users who can provide support and guidance. Alternatively, you can try using a gaming-focused distribution like Manjaro Gaming Edition, which is designed to provide a streamlined gaming experience out of the box.",SteamDeck

jgzk9ax,"Because I use my steam deck as my main computer. And for the past 13 years or so, I've used Ubuntu on whatever desktop I've had. My current desktop (well, I actually gave it to my nephew and installed batocera) was 8-9 years old. Maybe a bit older. Now my SD is my only computer besides an old ass janky Chromebook that refuses to die. 

Ive just become accustomed to the way Ubuntu does things. I can seem to find my way around steam os desktop mode just fine, but it feels kinda cut down and not full featured. Like it's there for troubleshooting or just basic functions. 

I will, of course, be dual booting with steam os. I still want it to be a steam deck and steam os is vastly superior for playing games. But it's less so for productivity. 

I know Ubuntu has a bad/noob rep in the Linux community. I don't care. It's not windows, and it works for me. I'm one of those weird Linux users that isn't a developer or programmer and I just use it as my go-to os. Much like most people view windows. 

Why not windows? 

I swore off Microsoft over a decade ago. I won't have anything to do with them on ethical grounds. I realize other large tech companies have ethical problems too, but I have a specific beef with Microsoft that I don't want to get into here. And it's indefensible in my mind. I'm also of the opinion that people should live how they want to live. If you want to use Microsoft products, that's fine with me. I don't judge. It's just that I won't.

Edit, if someone has a better idea or os than Ubuntu, I'm down to try. But the SD desktop mode is immutable. I realize it can be changed, I just don't feel like monkeying with it, especially when I'm not super big on steam os desktop mode to begin with.

When you add Non-Steam Profiles(Apps) it dosen't detect if you make duplicates of the same program because it dosen't matter. So if you already have a browser in your Non-Steam Apps, you can redo the following over and over again.

Rename the duplicate(or new) browser in Steam to ""Hulu""(dosen't have to be the same browser, i'm just assuming you have a specific one for Hulu) as a non-steam app, go into Game Mode & go to the launch options for the new/duplicate browser.

 There should be a bunch of existing commands that are already there, as Valve uses these commands to launch programs in Gamemode like Flatpak.

At the end of the command, add a space and write/paste:

jgzm8gz,"If you need to use the Microsoft office suite for work, youre stuck. I use Google's office suite, but i dont have anyone telling me what formats I need to use. 

Libre office and open office are both good alternatives, but they are _not_ 100% compatible with the Microsoft suite. I don't know enough about research publishing to give you advice. But I do know that it's the little formatting details that the Microsoft alternatives tend to get wrong. Like you'll open .doc in libre office and everything is skewed to one side. The _""open""_ standard file format for word processing is .odf and afaik, the Microsoft suite doesn't like them very much. I would assume the same for the presentation/spreadsheet files too, but I don't know. 

Microsoft has a stranglehold on office suite software. And it's only going to get worse once ai starts being integrated into it.

jh27zcm,"There could be several reasons why GTA V is running poorly after reinstalling it. Here are some things you can try to help fix the issue:

1. Make sure your Steam Deck is running in high-performance mode: If your Steam Deck is running on battery saver mode or power saver mode, it can reduce the performance of your device. Make sure that your device is in high-performance mode by going to the settings and selecting ""Power & sleep"" and then setting the power mode to ""Best performance.""

2. Check your storage space: Ensure that your Steam Deck has enough free storage space to run the game. Running out of space can cause performance issues, so consider freeing up space or expanding your storage capacity.

3. Check for updates: Ensure that the game and the Steam Deck operating system are up to date. Updating to the latest version can sometimes improve performance.

4. Check for background processes: Make sure no other programs are running in the background that could be using system resources. Close any unnecessary applications to free up resources for the game.

5. Lower graphics settings: Try lowering the graphics settings within the game to see if it improves performance. GTA V has a lot of graphics settings that can be adjusted to suit your device's capabilities.

6. Verify the game files: Verify the game files to ensure that all game files are intact and not corrupted. To do this, right-click on the game in your Steam library, select ""Properties,"" then ""Local Files,"" and click ""Verify integrity of game files.""

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact Steam support or Rockstar Games support for further assistance.",SteamDeck

Motion Blur is of course a huge one, fuck that shit. Also other settings also cause similar headache inducing effects too, you'd have to play around on each game to find them all but I will say that blurs and distortions are a huge part of motion blur, and any game that has settings for those, turning those down can help a lot as well.

But I have played a lot of Warframe, even had a friend I got into it quit in like a week because of that before trying any of my recommendations. I will say Warframe has a lot of eye candy, but it also has a LOT of settings to toy with.

If you ever decide to try it again, I'll first say, take a look at your own kit, actually, because sometimes it's specific weapons or frames visuals maybe even just a certain color on one you chose being too bright, but cutting off motion blur, regular blurs, level of detail visuals which are also a type of blur, and sometimes color correct, can help a lot, oh and playing with the FOV too sometimes some of those are more comfortable than others.

jh1b1dg,"If it's a toggle, then that means you need to press it to activate, and again to deactivate; so you set Outer Ring command to the key and switch from ""Regular Press"" to ""Start Press"", and then Add Extra Command, and for that second one do the same thing but switch to ""Release Press"" instead; that way it will hit the toggle key both getting in and getting out.

So for anyone finding this thread in future:

1. Set left joystick as directional pad and bind your keys
2. Scroll to ""Outer ring"" command
3. Add your bind to outer ring command
4. Change this command behavior to ""Start press"" (through settings button near command)
5. Add extra command (through settings button near command)
6. Add same bind to new command
7. Change this command behavior to ""Release press""

At the end you should have two ""Outer ring"" commands with same keybinding, one being of type ""Start press"" and other one of type ""Release press""",SteamDeck

jh28q24,"While the Steam Deck's internal storage can be upgraded, it's understandable that you may want to consider using an external hard drive for additional storage. The good news is that the Steam Deck does have a USB-C port that can be used to connect external storage devices.

However, it's important to note that not all external hard drives are created equal, and there are some requirements that need to be met for the hard drive to be compatible with the Steam Deck. The external hard drive must have a minimum transfer rate of 5,400 RPM and a maximum capacity of 8TB.

Additionally, games cannot be played directly off an external hard drive. Games must be installed onto the Steam Deck's internal storage or an SD card. However, you can use the external hard drive to store game files and transfer them between devices.

To set up an external hard drive with your Steam Deck, simply connect the hard drive to the USB-C port and follow the prompts to format the drive for use with the Steam Deck. Once the drive is formatted, you can use it to store games and other files.

Keep in mind that using an external hard drive may impact game loading times and performance, so it's important to choose a hard drive with a fast transfer rate and make sure it's connected to a high-speed USB-C port.",SteamDeck

As for input lag, I'm sure there is some measurable input lag, but I can't say these games feel unresponsive to me.

It looks like you're on duplicate/mirror now, I'd try putting it on one of the ""extend"" modes and see if that either fixes it immediately, or gets you enough screen space to fix the resolution manually.

Otherwise, you can hold the Win key and left-click and drag anywhere inside a window to reposition it even if you can't see its title bar. (And doing that with right-click instead will allow you to resize the window.)",SteamDeck
jgvas7j,"Edit: No this is all wrong lol, Steamdeck doesn't use X, it uses Weyland.

If you can open konsole (should be possible, click the 'start' button and type konsole + hit enter) you might be able to change it through xrandr.

    $ xrandr

will give you a list of attached monitors by interface, so identify which one is your monitor. And then, for example if it's HDMI-1, you can use:

    $ xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080

to set the resolution to 1080p.

Documentation here:

It sounds like you are unsure how this feature works in practice. Fortunately Valve developed this well. The Steam client does a serverside check of the state of the depot on your device versus theirs (the same kind of check when you pick the ""verify files"" option). If it detects any custom or modified files during the transfer, the client immediately switches to downloading from Steam servers. Steam resumes transfering locally again once it detects that the remaining files are fully equal. So you don't need to worry about any ""wrong"" files being sent. Steam only transfers files that it normally would during a game download. So no mods, no custom files, etc.

Source: Me who has tested this with downloading Skyrim and [this article](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/enable-steam-local-network-game-transfer) mentioning the requirements when Steam transfers",SteamDeck
jh0xego,Yes. Why would you though? It downloads 30Mb/s for me and local transfer is 970Mb/s. That's a noticeable difference.,SteamDeck

jh483zc,"Source : https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-why-valve-is-switching-from-debian-to-arch-for-steam-decks-linux-os/

« That's something Valve designer, Lawrence Yang, told us during our hands-on time with the Deck when we asked about the switch from Debian to Arch.

""So, Arch Linux, one of the main reasons, there's a couple, but the main reason is the rolling updates of Arch allows us to have more rapid development for SteamOS 3.0,"" says Yang. ""We were making a bunch of updates and changes to specifically make sure that things work well for Steam deck, and Arch just ended up being a better choice for them.""

On top of that, you're probably looking at updates to the graphics drivers and Proton could need some big changes too—which is the layer that ensures games designed for Windows work on Linux. Fundamental changes to SteamOS itself aren't out of the question either. 

Essentially, at launch, the Steam Deck is going to need plenty of smaller updates, not a big, one-off package.

The fact that Arch is based on a rolling release model, as opposed to a traditional all-encompassing update system, simply makes it a better option for Valve's needs »",SteamDeck
jh496oo,"Keeping it locked out of the box is part of how they provide a console-like experience. 


It’s not optimal if you intend to do a lot of development as your primary device, but it was built this way for a reason.

jh4debi,"I didn't know arch even existed. Always used mint, gentoo, ubuntu And Debian. Expected there are only .deb packages. Now that we have access to Aur, Flatpak, Appimage,snap. I'm not sure if the fragmentation of stores is useful. Canonical want to force their own shop and format, everyone wants to have a proprietary shop with their own packages.

jh67x3f,"There is multiple reasons, but it's mostly because of the philosophy of the distro.

One of the point of the Arch Linux philosophy is that :

>  Arch is a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one. The  principles here are only useful guidelines. Ultimately, design decisions  are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus.  Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not  politics or popular opinion. 
> The large number of packages and build scripts in the various Arch Linux repositories offer free and open source software for those who prefer it, as well as proprietary software packages for those who embrace functionality over ideology.

jh4f39l,"Well, I run Nobara on desktop (single-system, dual boot with Windows 10 for the games that don't run on Linux), and while I prefer AppImage for ease of use, in certain scenarios the jailed nature of Flatpak has its benefits.

And as you noticed yourself, it can introduce issues. Think about it this way: if those settings were worth it, would Valve have missed them? Would some of the most talented Linux developers creating a handheld gaming device miss simple flags they could set to improve performance? Of course not.

jh0ekgp,"A few games have minor reductions in stuttering from huge pages. It's pretty minor and you probably won't notice much a difference without benchmarks.

jh2o2ww,"5% improvement in some games is still a good improvement. Although I believe cryo settings help with general frame stability (since it helps with lows) more than actual raw fps, although I agree you’re not missing out on much. It isn’t some miracle. It’s just a set of settings with some trade offs. 

I don’t like the general idea of “if it’s so good why didn’t valve do it then huh?!?”. Decky loader has a bunch of plugins that tweak settings, like power tools. While it’s mainly used to fix a bug it has a lot more general settings that steamos doesn’t provide. Do you think valves developers missed settings like those as well? I don’t, i think they have a platform with a huuuuuggggeee variety of games and developers. It’s basically a pc right? It’s much more open than a console, so they have to choose settings that work with the majority of things while trying to get the best performance. That doesn’t mean you can’t tweak things to your individual use case right? Same general idea as OC and UV while obviously not the same thing. At least that’s the way I see it.",SteamDeck

jh0g1fl,Oh wow that’s convenient!! Will do this for sure,SteamDeck
jh2rl83,"> 5% improvement in some games is still a good improvement 

It also causes a 5% decrease in others, so on average, it's irrelevant. Unless you could toggle everything per game. 

> cryo settings help with general frame stability

That would be measured by frame pacing, that is, how much time in milliseconds each frame takes to be generated. Tests that measure this find no real effect from Cryoutilities. In fact, his own published tests (which should make his tool look the best) are so marginal a simple difference in climate would be enough to overwhelm the results. 

As for the rest of your comment... No, you're misconstructing the argument to attempt to sound smart. Decky Loader offers *additional* plugins with behavior not found on the device, while Cryoutilities changes default values from the OS that Valve also had to set themselves - it's not building something new that Valve didn't think or touch, it's changing the values Valve **specifically** chose. So that's why I can say ""why would Cryo set better values than Valve themselves?"".",SteamDeck

jh2ufo2,"First off on mobile my formatting won’t be pretty. 

Again that is why I said I agreed with you. The tweaks have pros and cons reread the comment. 

I’m not going to argue about whether or not it works. I already made my comments about that which agree with you in some cases. 

So you’re saying power tools doesn’t allow for gpu/cpu pinning on a much better scale than the quick access menu? Isn’t that an example of tweaking settings Valve set? Sometimes they pick the best setting for general stability or for whatever reason they have that we don’t know. That shouldn’t stop you from tweaking. What about UC and OC? You’re saying the AMD engineers are stupid and people shouldn’t touch that either? Not exactly the same thing but an example that fits here. They both have to go for a “one size fits all” decision in my opinion and the brings room for certain tweaks that will obviously have pros and cons. 

Also what about enabling trim? When his tool first released valve hadn’t done that. Why? Why is the default value for swapiness 100 meaning it can degrade the ssd by forcing the use of the 1gb swap file and degrade performance by using said file instead of the vastly superior ram? Are valves engineers stupid? Obviously not. We don’t know their reasons for choosing their specific settings. Either way those were examples intended to get my point across. Nobody is trying to sound smart and I’m not misconstructing any argument I’m trying to have a discussion.",SteamDeck
jh0fpbk,"No way you'll get a constant 60 out of it, I wouldn't have thought. It's not a very tidy running game. Spikes all over the place even on excellent hardware. Make sure vsync in game is turned off, it's paced all over the shop. 

Other than that, and low settings with a dynamic Res aiming for 60fps, I still don't think you'll get anywhere near it. The game is a confusing mix of CPU limited sometimes and GPU limited at others and that seems to be a worst case scenario for the deck in my experience.

Back then, you may have been able to demand a premium on one of these due to shipping delays and shortages. Even so, much like PS5’s, people just have not been biting on those scalper prices. I think it’s because most of the current gen systems are *want* upgrades, not *need* upgrades. If you have a PS4 Pro, a PS5 is a cool upgrade, but most of the games are playable on both. The Deck is definitely in a similar position, it’s not an upgrade on anything, and though it’s comparable to a Switch as far as form factor, the Switch is it’s own thing for out of the box Nintendo gaming.

Sort of. There's a lot of scalpers that got left holding the bag once availability became almost immediate.

Surprisingly, there's a lot of people that don't pay attention to who the seller is, and think it's just a way to get it from Amazon or whatever.

The screen protector, for some amazing reason, typically cracks and saves the screen in a lot of instances.

I bought the mid tier deck and immediately put on a protector as I opened it up the first time (that's the easiest time to apply one to avoid getting dust under the protector as you apply it).

Just keep in mind the Steam Deck is quite heavier than the average smartphone. In my opinion, don't ever tempt fate by holding the device with just one hand. When you use the protection case, always zip it up. This avoids the risk of the device falling out if you forgot zipping.

Due to the heavy weight of the Steam Deck, technically it could make sense to buy a glass screen protector.

I never dropped my Switch, and I notice that the bigger the device the less likely I'm gonna drop it.

So that's why you have to remove the drive.

I just don't know for sure if a Deck can even boot without a drive installed (never tested that) so it pays to be thorough.  Maybe it's fastest to just remove the drive from the get-go, and then see what happens.

Note that I have ""quick boot"" and ""quiet boot"" both disabled.  So in my case, I should always get the RAM readout and memory test, regardless of the drive's status.  but I don't remember if people get the Steam logo right away if quiet boot is enabled (which is the default).

Anyway, that's what happened when my laptop's m.2 drive (samsung) died.

The laptop sat there at a black screen (frozen logo afaik).

When I put the same drive in a desktop motherboard, I was able to enter the BIOS but couldn't access the drive--if it was set as the boot drive, the BIOS would just freeze for a long time then finally enter the UEFI --could not boot to it and in windows it displayed type 10 error.

It's likely that the Deck 2 will have USB4 and thus eGPU support, but the current Deck has just one way to get an eGPU, and that's by pulling the internal drive, using a PCI-E extension cord snaked out of the case, and then a hub with an external SSD to run SteamOS off of. And that's obviously a huge janky hassle.",SteamDeck
jh2c8rs,"You can't take an eGPU in an enclosure with you, either, and they're pretty expensive. If you shop used/refurbished you can build/buy a desktop for only a little bit more than an eGPU would cost. 

This isn't Steam Deck & eGPU vs Desktop. It's Steam Deck & Desktop vs *something that doesn't exist* because you can't actually connect the Steam Deck to a dedicated graphics card and keep it portable.

That's not even getting into how the Steam Deck's CPU would bottleneck most desktop GPUs. So even if it were easy and cheap to connect an eGPU to a Steam Deck, you still wouldn't be getting as much performance out of whatever GPU you pair it with as you could from a real desktop PC.",SteamDeck
jh2edaa,"The point of having an egpu is when you’re comfy at home you have desktop-esque performance, without having two separate devices. But you’re still able to game on the go with a performance loss at say, a hotel etc. Just because it’s not possible now, doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Laptops do it with egpus, only a matter of time till handhelds can. Maybe even the asus rog ally will be able to. 

I don’t get why having more options is a bad thing.. it’s like people are scared of their cult losing people or some stupid shit beyond me 🤷🏻‍♂️",SteamDeck
jh2f5wi,"There's a difference between a *future device* having an eGPU and the *Steam Deck* having an eGPU.

I'm all for some sort of handheld gaming PC having a USB4 port and being able to take advantage of eGPUs. If Valve can do it while still meeting the right price point, I think it would be a great idea that might finally bring the price of eGPU's down to the point where they're a reasonable option for most people.

If it's the latter, delete the prefix(either delete the file or use developer options-»delete proton files) and if you want to be sure, you can delete the game to be sure

Then download proton-7.3-GE-1

Stay in desktop mode

Set the game to use proton-7.3-GE-1, and when the launcher pops up, just press play, don't mess with anything, it's already in-game anyways

That's hard to say considering the SD is less than 2 years old so you may not see any evidence of that until further down the line.

I will say that overclocking panels in general reduces their life, but it can be fairly safe if the quality of the panel is good. Considering the fact that the SD is using run-of-the-mill 1280x800 panels in order to hit their aggressive price points, I don't know if I'd risk it personally.

I have a 512Gb model with a San-disk Extreme Pro 1Tb micro SD card.

Bioshock 1- bioshock 2 - bioshock infinite (gyro aim is great here if you want to try it, and it looks great imo. These stories made me actually care about game stories and are pretty short.)

Half life 1 (don’t be afraid to play on easy, made the game way more bearable for me. You will have to think to navigate for half life games. The whole appeal is that you are another employee figuring things out. If you try HL take breaks or else you may quit.

Fable anniversary (loved my playthrough, just as magical as Skyrim imo. Very linear and pretty short but was fun just picking a weapon and following markers and gradually having towns know my persons fame. Runs great)

jh08y21,"1. Yes, upon getting internet connection the steam deck will attempt to upload its save to the cloud if the game supports it, just make sure you give it a chance. IE get to a hotspot turn on steam deck and it should sync it.
2. Mine has never reached that hot but its still kind of winter for me and the weather is around 70-80 max for me, it really depends on the temperature of the environment of the deck. Majority of those mods are excessive and unnecessary.
3. if you stick with steam games there is almost no tinkering needed as if its verified on steam it should work out of the box. Check on protondb for instructions and how playable a game is before getting it. and yes tinkering can get complex depending on what you do.
4.  Check to make sure the Microsd card slot works, Check the screen for damages, run a game and check all the triggers, buttons, trackpads and joysticks for damage. Make sure the joysticks center in the calibrations after you flick it. check the screen for damage as well and make sure the feedback on trackpads still work.
5. I have a main pc and i find myself more often just laying on the couch now playing some random game on the steam deck or on my bed rather than sitting at my chair on my pc. Its quite relaxing, though I still suck as shooters with a controller though.

I would consider the steam deck to be quite cheap considering what it can do to be honest.  Specially if you get the 64gb version and just manually upgrade its internal storage to 512 or 1tb, its quite easy if you follow a video and go through it. 10-20 minute process.",SteamDeck

2) it doesn’t get that hot and slapping fans on the back is pointless. I don’t you’re getting any noticeable cooling that way

3) it’s not complex. It’s super easy if you’re willing to read 

4) I’d recommend getting a new one if you can but definitely check the controls with aperture desk job and if the wifI connects 

5) I personally never play the SD at home cuz I can just play games on my computer. I mainly play the SD during my train commute",SteamDeck
jh1e8tx,"1. Yeah it just asks later if you want to keep the cloud or local save
2. Not hot in my experience, some people don't like the fan noise but it doesn't bother me
3.
- Almost all ***steam games work fine***. You'll want to tweak controls for each game though unless there's a decent controller layout
-You can find guides to brute force mostly anything else to work on the steam deck, some things just take more time. We recently got emulated Zelda BOTW to 60fps
-A lot of issues are just general PC gaming woes. Some games have text too small to comfortably read on the small screen vs my desktop monitor with resolution too high to comfortably read lol. Having to do senseless anticheat/DRM workarounds, etc. There's a guide for everything though.
4. Make sure the touch screen works fine and maybe check the dead zone calibration menu for any stick drift. Ask if there are any aftermarket mods like a new ssd that could void the (1 year?) warranty
5. I mostly play in bed, it's perfect. It does get a bit heavy after a while so YMMV if you have any wrist issues",SteamDeck
jh24a2p,"I wouldn’t personally get one second hand because you never know what they’ve done with it and lots of people crack them open and tinker with the insides etc and who knows if the person who owned the one you get mucked it up somehow. 
That being said I’ve never tinkered with mine more than just adjusting basic settings and everything I’ve tried to play runs perfectly from the jump.

jh25iw9,"I heard some people dislike the fan noise and that it has to do with the Delta fan. Is there any way of knowing what fan a SD has without opening or turning it on? Is it specified somewhere on the box?

Regarding the weight, yeah, I know it’s almost double the weight of a switch. I did read tho that it’a more ergonomic and feels more natural to hold compared to the flatness of the switch. But I guess it also depends on hand size as well.",SteamDeck
jh24z4s,"Oh, I didn’t think it’d be risky getting a second hand one. I know some people buy smaller versions, upgrade the SSD then sell it for more to make profit. I did find a few that are still sealed though. I’m guessing people bought them on sale to sell them for profit. Regarding not tinkering, what games do you play from steam? Only the verified ones? Thanks a lot!",SteamDeck
jh15xhe,"I mean sometimes I would like better graphics or to crank the settings, but the resolution of the steamdeck has never bothered me, 720p on a 7inch screen looks pretty darn sharp tbh. 


If you're fairly tech savvy most of the tinkering you'll need to do is pretty easy tbh, you can get more in depth if you want, but you don't have to.",SteamDeck
jh0lsxb,"Yeah I mainly play the deck on the train commute, sometimes at home when I’m doing something else, but it’s obviously not nearly as powerful as my main PC.

“Downgrade” isn’t really the right word because many games perform just as well on the tiny 800p screen, even games like doom eternal run at 60FPS. Most of my favorite games of all time are games like Rimworld or dead cells or into the breach that run just as well on pc versus the deck.

However if you’re talking about PS5 and beyond era games, the games definitely don’t perform as well on the deck even with the lower resolution. It does run surprisingly well considering how cheap the device is, and locking it at 30 to 40 frames with low/ medium settings makes it playable for sure. And the small screen size also has the benefit where the graphical settings aren’t at noticeable compared to something at a big monitor 1440p or something.

You gotta imagine the steam deck as more or less a handheld PS4 which honestly is very amazing. Older games/ indie games it can run nearly flawlessly and for my own personal tastes the majority of AAA games are kinda bad/ boring so I’ve not really enjoyed any in some time (except death stranding lately).

jh0je9y,"how does one quantify ""twice as good?"" how does that compare with the unannounced price?",SteamDeck
jh0jegc,Twice as good sure for AT LEAST twice the price and later support is questionable at best.,SteamDeck
jh0m3f4,"The amazing thing is that a product that doesn't exist can claim to be anything they want ... whereas an actual product has to demonstrate.

The Steam Deck is not perfect, but is incredible at what it does and has been refined over the last year ... the ROG Ally is still vapor.

But what we DO know is that the ROG Ally has far fewer options in terms of controls - this means that it will play far fewer games well. The rear buttons and trackpads are incredibly useful for games designed with only the PC in mind - and something with fewer controls than the Switch simply isn't capable of those games.

As for performance? Who knows - synthetic benchmarks and spec sheets are nice, but similar to watching Apple/Google/Samsung/Intel/etc. trot out those amazing '2x performance' graphs every year at their show & tell ... it seldom translates to breathtaking real-world performance gains.

SteamOS is a Valve thing, and the Steam Deck will continue to be Valve's priority ... so the ROG Ally will necessarily struggle in that regard.

I hope it does well, competition is always good.  But my goal here is to play games - and the Steam Deck actually does that ... and does it incredibly well.",SteamDeck
jh0k5s9,"Think it depends on what you want a handheld for. The ROG Ally certainly could be better at running current AAA games than the Deck if the leaked specs are to be believed. So if that's what you really want from it, and are willing to wait and pay the higher price tag, maybe hold out.

For me personally, I don't really use my Deck for modern AAA games since I have a PS5, so I'm totally content to use it on older / indie / lighter weight games.",SteamDeck
jh0ytdw,Steam Deck hands down. I would not buy a newly launched product and be one of its testers.,SteamDeck

I see you are a gambler sir.",SteamDeck
jh0kwkm,We have no idea if it’s “twice as good” other than some fluff pieces. So nobody can answer that.,SteamDeck
jh12yyn,"Buy the deck, the trackpads alone will win this battle for the deck against the ally.",SteamDeck
jh0nwfk,"Linus Sebastian of LTT has been living with a ROG Ally, and he seems to really be liking it. He also said that their claim of twice as fast is no joke. And he is genuinely impressed with what it can handle and just how well everything seems to perform. 

That said, the price is going to be your deciding factor I think. Valve set off an arms race for handhelds it seems, and that's fantastic. Currently the Steam Deck has the best price to performance ratio, but no one knows how much an Ally will cost. It'll certainly be more expensive than a Deck. 

So take all of that for what it is. It *may* be worth the wait if price isn't an obstacle and ROG is able to deliver on what they're marketing (from the anecdotal evidence of Linus, it seems they're not being hyperbolic). But! The Steam Deck is killer and a great purchase. It comes down to whether you want to be patient or want something right now. 

Source: The WAN Show for Friday April 14, 2023",SteamDeck

If your buying horizon doesn't start until June,  make the assessment in June.   If there is more info on the Ally that solidifies the unknowns you then make the call there.",SteamDeck
jh13bwg,"""Twice as good"", what does that even mean?

Twice the GPU power, twice the performance, twice the resolution?

I'd have liked if the Steam Deck had been Zen3 and RDNA2. I think the CPU holds it back a bit more than the GPU. I think it was a power management and monetary budget decision to go with Zen2.

Other than that it is pretty much spot on for most things. 1280x800 is the right resolution for the screen size. 1920x1080 would have been too many pixels to push.

Bigger battery would be nice too.

It is built to a strict budget. It is very affordable.",SteamDeck

jh0su0a,"There are too many unknowns about the Ally to make this decision. I'm still skeptical about battery life on a handheld that supposedly runs twice as fast and pushes 120hz at 1080p. On top of that, Windows, in its current state, is not a great operating system for a handheld.",SteamDeck
jh0ulv3,You might as well wait for whatever comes after the ROG Ally because there’s going to be something better.,SteamDeck

If you want to play the latest AAA games though then the Ally will be better. The steam deck can play games like Hogwarts legacy well, but the decrease in graphics is noticeable. Personally I haven’t cared but if it’s something you want or care about it’s worth waiting.",SteamDeck
jh147sj,"After looking at it my concerns are:

* The cost, great if it matches around the Steam Deck but I'm skeptical.
* No trackpads - how will you navigate Windows easily?
   * Suppose you could plug in a keyboard? That's annoying to *always* have to do.
   * Without a keyboard, I feel this will be a pain to do some quick tweaks/mods/etc.
* Removal of additional buttons so less customizations
   * Great for games that are plug-n-play with a controller though
* Has it been confirmed that it has a gyro? 
   * If it doesn't that's a big hit for those that use gyro.
* Software updates? I know it's on Windows but will they continue to support the device? Valve has proven they're in it for the long haul.

I hope it does well, truly. I'm sure it will sell well but I'm just not convinced that the extra performance it can probably do is worth the tradeoffs listed.",SteamDeck
jh43zax,"ROG does not have trackpads. It's basically useless for any games that mostly use mouse like crpgs, fps's, RTS's and so on. It also features a more pixel dense screen than already 4k dense steam deck screen, meaning more battery drain and the 120hz will only be useful by very few games when not plugged in.   


Honestly the wise option would be to wait for the product to be out, see reviews and hold both in your hand and then make the choice.",SteamDeck
jh44giw,"No trackpads, no buy. And only two back grip buttons, probably no gyroscope either. I don't see this product being as useful for gaming as the steam deck.

I'm not sure that what the steam deck needs is more power right now. I think what it needs is a OLED screen and better battery power. I think they've hit the sweet spot with respect to performance.

jgzozeb,My options for 2TB was just the Western Digital SN740 2230 NVMe SSD.,SteamDeck
jgyxhdi,"There are several options for an NVME upgrade, so I ask that you please don't overpay for an SSD.    

You can get the [Micron 2TB Drive](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR99P.shtml&order_id=323669245&sitem=B09WR99#Availability)  straight from a US distributor for $158. The same price as the [1TB Inland TN446](https://www.microcenter.com/product/663766/inland-tn446-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck). 
The closest *available* option to this is the 2TB SN740 from AliExpress for $160+ but it's a risk and you won't have a warranty if you're within the US. The Micron 2TB has also been listed on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/micron-2tb-2400-series/p/0D9-0022-000N1?Item=0D9-0022-000N1) for $160 but is out of stock and they have cancelled many orders from those that were able to place them when it came in stock earlier this week...

Alternatively, if that's out of your price range you can buy the [1TB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01112_B09WR98P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!#Availability) for $89.  Comparatively, the [1TB Sabrent Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) sells for $160 on Amazon. And if you're fortunate enough to live near a Microcenter, they also sell their [1TB Inland TN346](https://www.microcenter.com/product/649991/inland-tn436-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck) for around $130.  

A lot of people find the convenience of going to Microcenter to purchase and exchange/swap the SSD *if* it ever fails much more valuable than the extra storage space and that's fine, but I would personally rather have double the storage and a new backplate for the same price or less than either of the 1TB Inland Drives.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, but the Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300.

jh09a01,"A 16-inch gaming laptop means you're going to have to get something in the 20 Liter range and bigger, even one as slim as the Framework. Having the Steam Deck as well means you want closer to the 25 Liter range.

The [Timbuk2 Custom Classic Messenger bag (Large)](https://www.timbuk2.com/collections/all-messenger-bags/products/116cust-custom-classic-messenger-bag) might be good. It's 28L and in your price range.

jh0yuwe,"Not sure if it's quite in your price range but I've been extremely happy with the waterfield designs bags. Everything I've had from them has lasted for literal years and got replaced because I wanted to not because it needed it. Currently I am actively using a backpack, city slicker steam deck case, and a gear bag. In the past I have used other backpacks and laptop sleeves with various pouches and padded straps. They are Durable, well designed, easy to find things in, and have multiple options for straps. The backpack straps are cut and attached in a way that pulls the backpack into your back and properly spreads the weight across your back instead of putting all at the bottom against your lower back. No more of that backpack stoop. The things I put in the backpack stay in their layers instead of shifting into a clump at the bottom. Cables and small items are easy to see against their lining. I would definitely get the upgraded straps if straps are a concern for you. The current default straps are a little thin.

They can be found at [sfbags.com](https://sfbags.com).

Edited because I wanted to clarify - The thin strap is not the backpack shoulder straps. Those are fantastic. It is the shoulder carry strap for the city slicker case. If you get something like that and the strap is optional/not integrated into the bag definitely upgrade the strap.",SteamDeck

sounds like you are going for need to play approach anyway so provided you’ve calculated your largest file size game and then give yourself wiggle room of 10 ~ 30GB for updates/dlc/shader data build up over time then you’re good to go.

It only happens once. I guess if you are _constantly_ moving stuff around it could matter, but (in my opinion) the faster cards aren't worth the money. (Keep in mind the reason that I choose those is because I could walk into a store and buy them. I won't order sd cards online. It's too much of a risk you get a fake card. Yeah, you can return them, but mail order returns are a pain in the ass. (Ask my wife. Ive been trying to return her for years and the website says no returns...)

If I go the dual partition route, I am def. getting the 64gb model and immediately upgrading to a 1tb SSD.

I was originally thinking that if I only use Win11, then I'd be fine with just getting the 256gb model; however, now I feel that I may as well just go with 1tb regardless.  More internal space def. would not be a bad thing.",SteamDeck

the L-R button is definitely in akward position, it's doesnt feel very good when using. but i rarely using it portable so it's fine. still its better to cut it. i see other hard case remove it alltogether

jgzugyo,"Just to add...

I get that Windows is bloated and all, and start-ups would likely be noticeably faster using the Steam OS over Windows 11 (so maybe this is why going the dual OS route is a popular choice); however, I feel like even with just a tiny amount of trimming of unnecessary processes, that Win11 would run just as smooth as the Steam OS would.  I could be wrong though, so if anyone has experience, please chime in.

Also if I do go the dual OS route, I'll likely go with two full partitions.  I hear that performance can suffer when booting from an SD card or USB drive, and I'll likely be playing PS5 games just as often as Steam games.  As far as I know the only downside to running two partitions over the removable boot drive route is the internal space needed; if that is indeed the case, then I'll plan on picking up the 68gb Deck and upgrade it with a 1tb SSD.",SteamDeck

Also, while things have gotten better on the driver front, be ready to deal with issues like trackpad detection, controller input weirdness, and other stuff. It's gotten a lot better in the last 6 months, for sure, but I always went back to stock.

In my case, it was easier to run Win10/11 off an external SSD so I could go back and forth. I would recommend you do that at least so you can see how it goes and either tweak Windows to your liking in preparation for a dual-boot and still have an easy way to back out.",SteamDeck

jgz1k7n,"So it depends, most games will run fine, if it works for linux it will likely work for the steam deck. Simply add it as a non steam application and inside game mode it will show up in the list.

Some games won't work because anti-cheat + linux = bad. Specifically battle-eye, but thats mostly on the game devs to enable the linux option for battle-eye.

I haven't tried sonic frontiers but it runs 40-60 if you use fsr according to [protondb.com](https://protondb.com) which is probably going to be your compatibility check site if you get a steam deck, users will list their experiences with Linux and steam games and steamdeck experiences there for each steam game. The other ones you list should have no issues.

Docked experience is just the same as handheld but on a bigger screen honestly. If you do use fsr it will be a bit easier to notice the tell tale blur that occurs. Get everyone controllers and you will just have some fun. Performance will go down a bit as you will likely be doing 1080p vs the normal 720p that the steam deck uses, but it shouldn't affect it much specially if you use fsr.

FSR is basically you setting the game to a lower resolution then it upscales the picture to a NEAR native resolution of what it would be. So it will likely have a ""slight"" blur or a softened edges. But this saves on a large amount of computing power on ""lower"" end pcs which a deck kind of falls into. Most of the time you won't notice much of a difference to be honest. Unless you are a huge graphics big boss.",SteamDeck
jh0h9fb,"1) the overwhelming majority of games will run fine. Check on proton db

2) the docked experience works fine but heavier games will struggle if you change the resolution to be much higher than 800p. Lighter games will work just fine though. I think you meant to type FSR. FSR basically upscales a lower resolution to a higher resolution to still have good performance yet fakes a higher resolution. Downside is it can appear blurry and smudgy. The deck has an AMD APU so it has built in FSR, but many games these days have it in the settings too. Me personally I never use it unless I really have to.

3) yes, gaming mode and desktop mode are the same thing, just a UI difference. If you install something in the desktop, through epic or gog through heroic or something, you can set a shortcut in the steam app. Now when you open up gaming mode you can access it easily. Bonus points if you visit steam griddb for custom box art.

The human eye can certainly perceive the difference between 30 and 60 fps. I might agree if someone said ""you can't perceive the difference between 24 fps and 30 fps."" 

This reminds me of a YT vid where a guy asserted that the human eye can't perceive 4k (""you can't see in 4k"" or some crap like that). Sure, if you put me 10 feet away from a TV without glasses, then yeah.. I can't see in 4K. However, I have a friend who happens to sit 3 feet away from his 65"" 4K TV who wears contacts.

jgrfa73,That's incorrect in two different ways.,SteamDeck
jgutdye,"Because classic animation doesn’t appear to be lifelike. It actually is jarring, just not enough to fully interfere with the persistence of vision effect, or how our brains create motion from frames. Same effect as if you close your eyes, you still see the light for a brief moment. Half the time we’re in a movie theater, we’re actually in darkness as the gate changes. 

Notice how games in 60 FPS look clearer to us, or 48 FPS movies? Or even smooth motion of TVs, which adds filler frames. Animation can go the other way and we can still see movement. More lifelike, CGI movies do render in 24 fps. 

The word “minimum” your post I referred to was wrong. Sorry I glossed over it. Also, in your last post, it’s not “effectively 12 fps.” It’s actually 24 with filler frames. We still fill in with persistence of vision, it’s just not as smooth. That’s why flips books work.

The price you quoted is definitely too high. Have a look at deals on Carbonite, I have seen a few steam decks sold there. Like any classifieds website be vigilant.

Plan B, like others said is to wait for the ROG Ally. The main selling point of the steam deck (other than the obvious) is the price. Hold out to see what pricing is like.

I got the deck for an 6 months exchange in Europe, so I knew I could not take my pc. I'll definitely continue using it as I mainly play older games and it's great to play in bed/ on the couch.",SteamDeck

IMO if you are not constantly on long trips or traveling where you want to play games, a steam deck is pointless (since mobile gaming is its core function) - I thought I get one because I spend 2 hrs a day riding a train, but never once I took the deck with me.

There's a weird price gulf when it comes to Android TV devices, you have this new Chromecast, a box from Xiaomi for about $80, and then at $150 and $200 you have two different Nvidia Shield versions which are the best experience but wayyyy overpriced considering its age in my opinion.

jgyvd0e,"I've seen videos of GTA V running great on the deck but haven't put time into myself. However, I played almost the entirety of RDR2 on it and it was almost flawless. I had some weird texture issues on the ground in certain spots of the map, but it didn't really take away from the fact I was playing anywhere I wanted. Using it for emulation is amazing as well. I just finished my first play through of Castlevania Symphony of the Night two days ago and I have about 80 other games I've yet to play. It allows me to play games I wish I played growing up wherever.

I wasn't a big handheld gamer growing up, but since middle school I have always wanted a controller with a screen attached that I could use CDs or some way to play AAA games and now I have it. Even if I only play a little at a time.

It also allows me to go chill with my dad while he watches TV or Youtube on the big screen and I can sit next to him and do my thing without interrupting his enjoyment. Even if we aren't talking, its still nice to sit together. Or sometimes I go out to the living room with my Gpa and do the same thing, and I know he enjoys the company. I will sometimes use my bluetooth headphones and keep them slightly off so I can be aware of any conversation.

ALSO! Sometimes I chill in the backyard and listen to the birds and get some sun time.

While I have a 3DS and Switch, the Steam Deck hits harder with the hardware. So it is also great to use alongside other handhelds that can't quite play the same games.

AND it may not matter to you, but having an almost seemless cloud save so I can go back and forth from my desktop is awesome. Makes me wish Nintendo and Sony did the same thing with their devices.

ALSO, Valve consistently updates the thing and more and more games become verified as time goes on. Which can be daunting, but with the steam catalog and how immense it is, there are thousands of games to look forward to.",SteamDeck

While they do have single player modes, you have to have an internet connection to get those games to run. Sadly there are many other games like that. Some require an internet connection to start the game, some require an internet connection within a random time frame of 24 hours to 7 days to play, and some don’t have this restriction. It’s a great device but you’ll need to pay attention to what you get if you plan on using the Steam Deck as a way to game on the go because sometimes it can be frustrating or even annoying when you find out that the single player game you want to play can’t run because you don’t have any wifi available.",SteamDeck

Yes, because the OneXPlayer2 has an AMD Ryzen 6800U inside of it.

> Can I expect 60fps in OneXplayer2?? 

It's got a Radeon 680M, which is probably 60% the performance of a mobile GTX 1060 so you could probably get a solid 60fps if you tweak the settings.

jgx11vg,"standalone: Using a stand alone emulator for the system

not standalone: Using retroarch (a multi system emulator) for the system

There is an internal rebellion attitude within the emudeck project, that has reached silent consensus, to try to move as many emulators to standalone and away from retroarch (the option to use retroarch will exist into the future probybly) as possible,

Benefit of standalone emulators usually: Better performance, more recent releases.

Benefit of retroarch usually: Better shader integration, better filter integration, retro achievementds integration, usually - better border cropping (via shaders), fast forward implemented as a standard, and a unified user interface, that if you learn once, you dont need to learn again.

Downsides of retroarch, UI (the thing that pops up, when you hit l3+r3 in a game running on retroarch) too complex for 90% if the users in this reddit. Emudeck usually tries to hide it because of that.

And no one likes the dev ethos behind retroarch(/libretro), because they ""stole code"", and had frequent disgreements with scene developers, because they pushed hard to get better and newer cores (cores is what retroarch calls emulators) integrated into retroarch - so now in maintaining those cores they usually lag a little behind the main development braches, because most of the goodwill is gone.

Retroarch: Insanely useful for the normal user - usually for older systems. But nobody likes them. :)",SteamDeck

You *can* just go by the 'Steam Deck verified / playable' badge in Steam's store pages, but ProtonDB is crowdsourced and generally more reliable.

(note: as mentioned by others, if something doesn't work this way, it may work in Windows, so it isn't literally impossible to play something that is confirmed unsupported by ProtonDB, but dual booting can also be a pain in the backside, so do your research if you intend to rely on this).",SteamDeck

The only real issue you may run into is compatibility with the SteamDeck itself. The SD is a handheld PC - you can pretty much do whatever you like with it including (if you're so tempted) just installing Windows.

I can't help you with working out whether the games you want to play will actually run on the SteamDeck - that's something you'll need to look up for yourself unless somebody else has experience with them - but in principle there's nothing about the SD itself which would prevent you from at least trying to run whatever you run on your PC normally.",SteamDeck

I would stick to Steam games tho where ever possible

For other stores, some got native Linux clients, others got third-party clients, and some just don't give a fuck and you have to rely on doings things manually. Apps like Lutris and Bottles could be useful to help you get some Windows-based games installed; with some stuff it's not much different from how you would do on Windows, besides having to use an app like those to get things started, but others may require a bit more tinkering.

Often, using Steam's Proton or something derived from it (or the original Wine), thru Steam if it's in there, or with one of the other tools mentioned previously, is enough to get Windows apps running on Linux; but there are some individual cases that are trickier to get running, or may not even run at all.

If you play the multiplayer for 2 the same hacker has been crashing those matches on and off again for years.  For some reason Respawn and EA don’t care to do anything about it.  So multiplayer for 2 is spotty.

jgxyfhk,How do you do this?,SteamDeck
jgxv2bh,"You can make a set of layers that goes: soft left trigger pull (enable gyro), full pull (enable gyro and aim down sights). That way you get gyro while hipfiring.",SteamDeck
jgrrjle,"I would like to clarify a few things about input lag on the deck, because I have the impression a lot of the input lag you’re experiencing is being wrongfully attributed to gyro filtering. The baseline input noise filtering for gyro should not result in any noticeable input lag for the user. If you’re experiencing noticeable input lag of any kind on your Steam Deck it’s either:

-Gamescope frame rate limiter being active.
-Vsync being active in the game.
-Poor frame rates because the game is too demanding.
-a combo of all of the above

I can’t stress enough how much Gamescope can add to noticeable input lag altogether. A great way to demonstrate this actually through Titanfall 2 or some other game that the deck can easily run at 60fps with little resources. add the following line to the launch options of Titanfall 2: +fps_max 120 (yes that 120fps. There is a reason for this I’ll come to later) Make sure vsync is turned off in the game, start a mission and play as you usually would. If everything is setup correctly the steam decks performance counter should indicate 120fps during gameplay. Now periodically switch between Gamescope frame limiter OFF and set locked to 60fps. The amount of noticeable input lag should feel like night and day! So when possible it’s typically always best to limit frame rates with a games own frame limiter if it has one.

Better yet, these older titles can usually easily run at 120fps without doubling the workload for the CPU or GPU. Despite the 60hz screen not making the image look smoother, the faster frame pacing still greatly reduces the experienced input lag even further. Hence why I recommend to set Titanfall 2’s frame rate to be set to 120 instead of 60. This benefits everyone, not just gyro players.


Every variable that adds a measurable delay between user input vs onscreen output technically constitutes input delay, yes. But that’s not be the reason you’re *noticing* input lag while using gyro. 
The filtering is not so much a delay as it is just, well, a filter. The more aggressive the filter the smoother but also more “sluggish” the input will feel. There is a gyro “smoothing” slider in Steam Input that gives a noticeable amount of lag if you max it out, but if your turn it down to a value of 0 and you system/OS/game/controller aren’t using settings that cause additional input lag, it should feel pretty much instantaneous 


The biggest contributors to perceivable gyro input lag are performance bottle necks, vsync and external frame rate limiters. You could have a mouse with the fastest polling rates on the most powerful and optimised gaming PC in the world, but If you play on a 60hz display with vsync enabled your input will still feel really laggy. The same applies to gyro.",SteamDeck

jgrpsvi,"I wouldn't make that argument about any of those, tbh, even though a lot of them are very good. Deep Rock Galactic is particularly cute and fun, though. And people who love DOOM Eternal do seem to *really* love it

Neon White seems like almost a whole new genre, although I guess it *is* technically an FPS in that it's FP and you do S. I don't know how you'd compare it to Titanfall 2 either way, it's more in the realm of hyperfocus games like Hyperdemon. That's the one I'd put closes to Titanfall 2, probably, although again, it's *so* different from other FPSs. I should get more time with that game

But the rest of those are more in the good enough camp. Destiny wants to keep people buying their expansions, and they do, but the Destiny community always seems to be miserable about it. But then again, just about every game community is always miserable, so 50/50 whether that means anything. Gamers don't know how to be happy. But that and BL3 are shlooters, all about the grind. Fine for people who want that! But I wouldn't say they're all-timers like Titanfall 2

I haven't tried Modern Warfare, but it looks like yet another by-the-numbers ""RIPPED FROM (but legally distinct from!) THE HEADLINES"" modern military shooter. I'm sure it's a very good one of those! Appropriately gritty and nice-looking, and like every singe other identical game, I'm sure it really captures the sense of being provocative without ever taking anything that could be called a position. Maybe I'm missing out! But I very much doubt it

Ape Legs is yet another battle royale. Like it feels better than most battle royales, for sure, but it doesn't feel as good as Titanfall 2. And it's also the main reason we'll never get a real Titanfall 3 (even tho it would definitely be a loot box grind if we ever did, because EA). Again, it's a *very good game*, but I wouldn't call it an all-time great

And to be clear, I don't think there were a huge bevy of great FPS games *before* Titanfall 2, either. I just think it's the best of the last bunch. Rainbow Six Siege, Titanfall 2, the DOOM reboot, and the Wolfenstein reboots all hit within a few years of each other. They're all super different and great in their own ways, and it's like taking a look at where the industry could (should!) have gone, but instead everyone started chasing Fortnite and/or getting really into legally-not-gambling

jgrsduj,"\> But here's something fun: I'm not in charge of which games are great, just the ones I think are great! It's ok if you think different games are great! 

I'm aware - but that doesn't really preclude discussion, does it? As it's okay to have different opinions, it's also okay to discuss them and make a case for them with others. 

I think you might just be particularly enthused by Titanfall 2. For me, it was good, very well executed, but not *particularly* innovative or exciting. I enjoyed my time with it, it's a solid 8/10. I wouldn't call it an all-time great. 

Modern Warfare (2019) was really good, compeltely revitalized the Call of Duty franchise, which was dying. The gameplay mechanics are just as fluid as Titanfall 2 and the multiplayer is great. You seem to hate CoD for being a standard military shooter that is amoral at best, but I don't recall Titanfall 2 being particularly profound or philosophical in its messages, either. 

Neon White and Deep Rock Galactic could indeed be called their own genres - but genres adapt and advance over time, and this, in my book, is a sign of a *healthy and active* genre. It points to the continuing innovation and success of FPS games, which is only likely to continue to grow. You imply the genre is stale, but games like this surely prove the opposite. 

You say that *you* wouldn't make the argument about any of these games being better than Titanfall 2, but that's not really what I was stating. It's okay Titanfall is your favourite. I'm just stating that from an objective standpoint, you make a valid argument that any of these is as good or better than Titanfall 2. For example, my favourite out of these is Doom Eternal, but I can see how Neon White could be considered a better game by some. 

Overall, my point is that the FPS genre isn't dead - it is increasingly varied, accomplished, and a ton of fun.",SteamDeck
jgsmfzd,"Yeah, we killed ash, but her robotic parts could be repaired",SteamDeck
jgrxujt,"I think the CoD MW games are actually *im*moral, but not egregiously so. They're just very much about finding ways to justify the kinds of atrocities that actual modern militaries commit without justification all the time. It's the inverse of having a villain present a good argument, but then he kills a puppy so you connect their argument with puppy murder. We've gotta assassinate this leader because he wants to use an atomic bomb! But that's all modern military shooters, really

But what I mainly don't like about them is that they all feel the same. You dash around and ADS, click on some heads, rinse, repeat. I like some of the other CoDs that mix up the movement a bit, but the contemporary/recent past-set military shooters all start to blend together. And again, I'm sure the new MWs are fine! But it's a setting and style of gameplay that's just been done all the way to death

CoD4 was the Last Great Shooter for quite a few years, when almost everyone else was chasing that high. We might get a new crop of actually good games if enough big states recognize that loot boxes are gambling or something, but I feel like it's going to be quite a while

Until then, there's plenty of other stuff to play, plus smaller indies experimenting with genre mashups. And that's fine!",SteamDeck

jgxeovi,Micron 2tb 2230 $160,SteamDeck
jgxl0ee,"There are several options for an NVME upgrade, so I ask that you please don't overpay for an SSD.   

To start, you can ONLY fit a 2230 NVME drive inside the Steam Deck, which narrows the market down quite a bit.   

You can get the [Micron 2TB Drive](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR99P.shtml&order_id=323669245&sitem=B09WR99#Availability)  straight from a US distributor for $158. The same price as the [1TB Inland TN446](https://www.microcenter.com/product/663766/inland-tn446-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck). 
The closest *available* option to this is the 2TB SN740 from AliExpress for $160+ but it's a risk and you won't have a warranty if you're within the US. The Micron 2TB has also been listed on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/micron-2tb-2400-series/p/0D9-0022-000N1?Item=0D9-0022-000N1) for $160 but is out of stock and they have cancelled many orders from those that were able to place them when it came in stock earlier this week...

Alternatively, if that's out of your price range you can buy the [1TB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01112_B09WR98P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!#Availability) for $89.  Comparatively, the [1TB Sabrent Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) sells for $160 on Amazon. And if you're fortunate enough to live near a Microcenter, they also sell their [1TB Inland TN346](https://www.microcenter.com/product/649991/inland-tn436-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck) for around $130.  

A lot of people find the convenience of going to Microcenter to purchase and exchange/swap the SSD *if* it ever fails much more valuable than the extra storage space and that's fine, but I would personally rather have double the storage and a new backplate for the same price or less than either of the 1TB Inland Drives.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, but the Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300.

If (IF!) Apple ever got serious about non-phone gaming, they could be a real force.

iPhones and iPads have cutting edge graphics, with the entire device/stack built around rendering performance at very low power levels.

The Mac, not so much. Its priorities are different. It's a monster at general purpose, but lags when it comes to raw 3D rendering power, compared to enthusiast GPUs.

If Apple decided to make, say, an Apple Arcade-powered handheld, I'm sure it could be a casual gaming monster, in terms of performance, battery power and visual fidelity. The hardware design prowess is obviously there, and Metal is competitive (and integrated in to the major engines). I doubt it would be another Pippin.

BUT... it would also have all the Apple baggage. i.e. a high hardware price point, the Apple-knows-best philsophy, terrible Apple-knows-all controls (see: AppleTV remotes), and would be limited to the (admittedly huge) App Store library. It would be a walled garden, like the Switch and iOS devices.

It wouldn't be something for Steam fans, tinkerers or enthusiasts. But then, neither is the Switch, and that hasn't stopped Nintendo from selling umpteen millions of them. (Big difference is that Nintendo has first-party exclusives.)

Okay... so who is going to design these ""exclusive titles""? Apple isn't a game developer, so they won't be making the games.

Third parties won't. As porting/making your game for a £3000 VR headset for an over £1000 computer won't garner many sales.

I'm gonna want a source for this, as this is a pretty big claim.   


> With that being said, once the product becomes ""affordable"" (for Apple  standards) it will have a real opportunity for mass adoption. 

Define ""Mass Adoption"" How many sales are we talking?

Because for reference the PSVR2 is considered to be ""underperforming"" and has sold 500k units and people are saying that is too expencive, with it costing £550 for the Headset and £400 for the PS5 console.   


Speaking of cost. How much do u expect the ""later gen"" versions to cost? Because keep in mind the cost of a Apple Silicon computer is already more than a PS5+PSVR2, so what will the cost be? And if people aren't gonna want to buy a PSVR2 why would they get Apple's VR headset which is gonna cost 2 times if not 3 times more?",SteamDeck

Desktop mode on the deck does not use wayland, and instead uses a display server called X. It doesn't have vsync built in.

The problem? The anti-aliasing isn't great and results in loads of jaggies. You can, however, solve this with the Alias Isolation mod.

Alias Isolation works by injecting itself into Alien Isolation to smooth out all the jagged edges. This isn't possible by adding it as a non-Steam game but you can get around it.

**Quick Version**

* Boot into Desktop Mode
* Load up Alien Isolation at least once
* [Download the latest Alias Isolation mod](https://github.com/aliasIsolation/aliasIsolation/releases)
* Copy the Alias Isolation files
* Go into the Alien Isolation folder and create a new folder inside (called ""Alien"" or something similar)
* Move ALL the Alien Isolation files into the new folder
* Go up a level into the Alien Isolation folder (you should only see the Alien folder we just made) and paste the Alias Isolation files
* Load up Alien Isolation as normal and Alias will boot first.
* Now just set the path and turn the settings down and you're good to hit play.
* (You'll know it's working cause the load screens will say Alias Isolation)

Everything went according to the guide except the last part.

When it started the game there was no Alias Isolation, it just started as normal.

When I went back into Desktop mode to check the folders it seems like it just downloaded the game again. So it does seem like it was looking for the files and when it could not find them it just downloaded the whole game again.

I will try it again today but I've not seen anyone else with this issue.

jgr02tk,"Turning off AA is not an option for me at 800p. You literally lose subpixel detail when disabling proper AA and even bad AA can reduce shimmering and flickering a lot.

The intention of AA is NOT to blur, it's to provide more detail, which otherwise get's lost between the pixels, and/or remove jagged edges. Just because post AA like FXAA or SMAA and poor implementations of TAA can't do the former and are limited to a poor imitation of the latter, doesn't make them define AA.

Blurriness is an unwanted side effect, which is intensified by the comparatively low resolution and by the size of the individual pixels of the Steam Deck and by poor AA implementations like FXAA or SMAA and poorly tuned TAA.

Some good AA implementations actually do have a sharpening pass, because of that. Great AA can give you a much sharper image with more details than no AA, because you are not limited by the pixel grid, which can swallow quite a lot of subpixel information like wire fences and foliage, for example. Great AA is literally resolving and displaying more detail.

If a game has bad AA you could enable fxaa or smaa in vkBasalt as described in the .conf, but as I said in the OP it'll be applied to the whole image, including HUD and menus and may chew up the text. Depending on the game and your tolerance for this, you might enjoy it. I don't like it.

Most modern games have at least some form of AA and older ones can be super sampled by setting the resolution to 2x on both axis (2560x1600) and enjoying the purest and best form of AA simply by bruteforcing it.",SteamDeck
jgurswk,"It should work, but as this is applied to the entire rendered frame, effects like FXAA and SMAA will most likely chew up some elements of the HUD as well as text.

jgwfusq,"I don't think so. If it does it's negligible.

jgr5mjt,"Sorry, you're conflating a few different things...Anti-Aliasing **does not** provide more detail. Yes, it does ""remove jagged edges"", but that's literally called blurring. It makes them **look** less blurred and can make colors blend better, but it literally does it by manipulating what's there to make it **less clear**. I'm sorry, but that's a fact of what AA is and how it works.

Yes, you're right about the rest - it can assist with shimmering/flickering and the weird jagged stuff...but it does it by literally degrading the actual visual quality slightly. The higher-level versions of AA do it really **well**, so there's usually not a lot of downside, but it doesn't negate that you're actually losing visual acuity. Doing after-the-fact secondary post-processing to ""clean"" it up is just attempting to undo what AA already did.

jgrax3t,"The other guy seems like he's dropped straight out of /r/FuckTAA and raaaaaaged lol! I don't understand why everyone's so highly opinionated about tech.

I have this issue with Zelda BOTW on cemu, still struggling to remove jaggies on that game :(

Anyway thanks for this vkBasalt trick OP, will check it out!",SteamDeck
jgu3s94,"MSAA is basically a limited version of SSAA that only applies to polygon edges.

jgunlh5,"Sigh..

My friend, just because you make something **BOLD**, doesn't mean it's right.

Several people have tried to tell you via comments and via downvotes, that you are incorrect.

You should drop it on this one.

Anti Aliasing, and computer graphics in general, are a fascinating topic and I encourage you to keep your enthusiasm for it, but please try to educate yourself before ranting on the internet about it.

I know it's hard, especially on reddit, since there is so much regurgitated bullshit floating around, but there are some great sources to learn. I advise you to play around with graphics settings yourself as well. You'll quickly realize, that much of what you said is completely wrong.

I'll leave you with this simple image, which directly contradicts each and every key point of your ""argumentation"", namely the bits where you said:

Proper Anti Aliasing does provide more detail. Without AA, there are literally entire chunks missing in the fence and in the foliage as well as the wires up top, because without AA you just can not resolve sub pixel details. They're lost.

Proper Anti Aliasing does not manipulate what's there to make it less clear. As I've said multiple times, it's literally resolving MORE. With Anti Aliasing you can get details you can not get without, I can just repeat myself over and over. The image is literally rendered at a higher resolution or multiple times at a slight offset to resolve details you would not be able to render without AA. The method depends on the type of AA used and not all AA does this, of course (like FXAA or SMAA) but that was the original goal of Anti Aliasing.

It's also not degrading the visual quality and you're not losing visual acuity! In this case it's objectively enhancing the visual quality. There's more detail, there's finer detail and you lose the stairstepping artifacts. This one, again, depends highly on the AA used.

Now the big part: The ShArPnEsS! You keep telling yourself that AA blurs the image. You even said that it's the ""intention"" of AA. And as I've said before: You're wrong! As you can see in this image, it's NOT blurrier. In fact there are parts in the image where the AA image has much finer details than the no AA image, just because the no AA image can not display anything below the size of a single pixel. That's why the wires up top and in the fence are much thicker while also being mangled beyond recognition. The AA image literally has details that are smaller than a single pixel. It's not BLUR, it's SMOOTHNESS. You have to realize that the raw look of no AA isn't how it's supposed to look. The sharpness of no AA is not ""desirable"" or ""correct"". It's a limitation that we've overcome with AA. It's not the ""ground truth"", it's an incomplete result with issues.

Proper AA is not about smoothing changes in texture in color. It's to RESOLVE MORE DETAIL and break free of the limitations of the PIXEL GRID. It doesn't lower the clarity, it literally gives you MORE DETAILS! Again, just because some forms of AA only try and approximate smooth slanted edges doesn't mean that that's what AA is about!

Now, I have to put some disclaimers out here as well: I'm not saying that all AA is created equal. There are AA solutions out there which do some of the points you state (for example SMAA and FXAA do only use what's there to trick you into thinking you're seeing more detail). However, just because some forms of AA do a bad job at certain things, doesn't make them define the ""intention"" of AA. The goal of AA is NOT to blur the image. The goal of AA is to render the image without the constraints of the pixel grid and resolve detail beyond that. The fact that the image get's smoother isn't a drawback, it's closer to how it's supposed to look. That's not blur.

Have a nice day!",SteamDeck
jgrema4,"You're welcome!

jgrc4tw,"Except I literally agree with you on all of that - my point was that their understanding of what AA is and what it does is wrong and you can more finely-tune the AA to get better results than use AA and then try to clean up the image after-the-fact.

I use AA in all my games...but it **objectively** degrades the actual sharpness of the image. That's literally what it does. It's fine to like AA and still understand how it works.",SteamDeck

jguzb48,"Are you running on steamos or on windows?

(hashtag: whatsalinux)",SteamDeck
jguzf7s,SteamOs,SteamDeck
jguzjzg,"so, did you install the .net .exe(s) through steam? (rightclick add to steam), or using lutris, or bottles, or heroic?",SteamDeck
jguzr05,added it to steam and ran it by forcing it to use proton as a steam compatibility tool.,SteamDeck
jgv0mr1,"ok.

then the .net installations should show up as ""games"" in steamos (game mode).

easiest way to uninstall what you installed would be to go to game mode, settings, enable developer settings (just the toggle developer mode on, see: https://www.google.com/search?q=steam+deck+developer+settings )

then go back to the "".net game"" in game mode and there should be an option in that shortcuts settingsoptions called ""delete compatibility data"" or similar (from memory). Hit that, and after that, ""uninstall"" the game. Also from its game mode shortcut.

If you dont have .net installed as a game anymore (""it not showing up as a game in game mode"") it gets more complicated.

Then you'd have to find the most recent folders in your steam compatdata folder (you are looking for numbered folders), and check them for size (should be quite small), and maybe delete them - although if you deleting the wrong one you might loose your savegames in installed games, or even break certain proton version so yeah.. have fun. ;)

Also this i not at all how you do it. Installing .net framework I mean. :)

Because, basically every .exe you add to steam and run via its steam shortcut, gets its OWN set of fake windows directories (those numbered folders in compatdata), and they all are seperate from each other. So you never installed .net in a way that spiderman could see it. :) You basically installed your own seperate game called .NET that set in fake windows folders of a ""fresh windows install"", looking jolly and propper... ;)

Note, you cant follow windows tutorial to do stuff on a linux device (Steam OS).

Now, how you'd normally install .net framework is as follows. Install protontricks, point it to the spiderman prefix. then do this:
https://discord.com/channels/934078500552462346/955837767680655370/1088000978869043210

But first learn a bit more about SteamOS, and how the proton compatibility layer works. Google for steamdeck compatdata folders, to learn stuff. :)

Also, to run a mod launcher for example, without it creating a new set of fake windows folders, you need to actually edit the steam shortcut to your game, and replace the path to the games exe with the the path to you mod installer exe. So no new shortcut is created, which would then create its isolated fake set of windows folders again.

Issue, thats not so easily done in games installed via steam (because their shortcut settings look different that ""non steam game ones"" where you could just do it, ...). Lets just say people stopped supporting folks who wanted to install mod but easy, for a reason.. ;)

Its doable if you know how to. But its many steps.. ;)

People mstly resorted to modding their games on windows, then moving the files over, or installing the mod launcher in lutris. then moving the entire steam os files of the game over into lutris' fake windows folder structure for the mod installer, then modding it there, and then moving files back... Its not exactly easy.

There should be a few tutorials out there mostly onhow to do it using Skyrim?

So learn it with those if you want to learn it.",SteamDeck
jgv18hw,Yeah I'm not the brightest...after running the exe and letting it do its install once I realized it didn't work I removed them as steam games which i see I shouldn't have. Thank you for your answer though.,SteamDeck
jgv1swv,"In my struggles with Battle.net I noticed that all my forced installs (""adding as a game"") had significantly higher numbers in/on their directories than Steam's games. Also, there's a file in there somewhere that contains a string referencing whatever it is, so then you wouldn't have to go and delete blindly. Will edit if I figure out what that file is called.",SteamDeck
jgv1u6v,"then you are looking for current (as in created today) small (as in only the .net installer in it) numbered folders in the compatdata folder in the steam folder.

Google around how to find that.

(And in the linux file explorer, make sure you enable ""show hidden files and folders"", because otherwise folders with a dot ( . ) in front of their names wont show up, because those are hidden folders in lunux, and you need them to show up to find the compatdata folder, and the numbered folders in it. :) )

But dont delete the wrong numbered folder in the compatdata folder! ;) So browse arround a little in them, see if you find installed files --

But then your best prevention mechanism to delete something thats not that .net install is to make sure, that the numbered folder was created today (presumable the day you first hit ""play"" on the .net installer in steam, which is when the numbered compatdata folder gets created (=fake windows folder structure). And making sure, the numbered forlder in compatdata folder is very small (because, only .net files in there). :)",SteamDeck
jgv3pz8,"Thank you, my recent folders do have higher numbers. Still worried about blindly deleting something though so i'm my best to figure out what everything is lol",SteamDeck
jgv8xrz,something thats still throwing me off are the folders i showed in the picture I linked. I have no idea if those were already there or if they were made because the .net installer exe installed .net lol,SteamDeck

jgvil97,"I also dont know, and you would have to rightclick go to path, or rightclick properties to see the path, what I'm presuming is, that all those ""fake windows folders"" that get created in compatdata, already get created with .net folders in them.

But thats just a guess.

The opposite of what you are probably expecting is much more likely, so the design of getting one set of fake windows folders per exe is exactly there so one install can not propagate everywhere in the system. So that your installation did that (created 20 folders) is very, very unlikely imho. Far more likely, that they were still there to begin with.",SteamDeck

D2R ran lovely, and playing it on a handheld helped as I was wracked with covid at the time. The most I wanted to do in my incredibly rough state was roll over and play more druid like a filthy addict.

I don't really get why people complain about Secret of Mana. Sure, the voice acting isn't good, and you can tell they were working on a smaller budget for that release, but it was still great! A pixel remake like they've been doing with the earlier FF games might've been more well-recieved, but they managed to get a lot of detail into those models anyway. Very faithful while also receiving full 3D treatment.

Now, I *do* understand why some people complain about Final Fantasy 7 Remake; that's probably Square's biggest example of a game that *isn't* faithful to the original. While it may be a great game in its own right, they've changed so much about its mechanics that it's more like they transplanted FF7's story into an entirely different game.

Because there were notable framerate issues on PC also I’m hoping that means Blizzard can further optimize the experience in those rough spots.  I heard yesterday that the game had gone gold, so it’s also very likely that play experience in the beta is what we’ll get on launch day (hopefully with improved servers and no queues).

Even if there are no further improvements, I like the prospects of playing D4 on either PC or Deck and think either should be a great experience.  I had a blast during the beta and am stoked for the rest of the game.",SteamDeck

* Go to Desktop mode
* Open up the Discover Store
* Search/Install 'Steam Link'
* Create a link to Steam to use in the Steam UI
* Relaunch SteamOS

From here make sure your laptop has Steam running and then connect via Steam Link. This will be dependent on the Wifi you're currently staying at. Two wireless connections usually means a bad time but it *can* work. Just make sure to output resolution is set natively to the Deck to limit the amount of bandwidth required.

Why use this over direct connection to a game in Steam via the 'Stream' button? Steam Link allows you to view stats to see what's going on to determine if it's network issues. Most importantly, it allows you to close Steam Big Picture if needed and access other areas of your laptop i.e. Game Pass.

jgr4bjw," Chat GPT3 says...

It's difficult to accurately predict the exact year when SD cards will be able to store a petabyte of data, as this will depend on various factors such as technological advancements, market demands, and research investments.

However, based on current trends in memory technology, it's possible that SD cards could reach petabyte capacity within the next decade or two.

Currently, the highest capacity SD card available on the market is 1 terabyte, but the industry has been steadily increasing storage capacity over time. With the development of new materials and techniques, such as 3D NAND flash memory and advanced lithography processes, it's likely that SD card capacity will continue to grow rapidly.

Additionally, there is significant research and development focused on new storage technologies, such as phase-change memory, memristors, and quantum storage, which could potentially offer even greater capacity and performance than existing flash memory.

Overall, while it's difficult to predict an exact year for petabyte-capacity SD cards, it's reasonable to expect that such technology could become available within the next 10-20 years based on current trends in memory technology.",SteamDeck

But if you have a device, like an SSD with tons of write cycles before it's used up, why wouldn't you just use Zswap so you can dedicate less RAM for the same amount of memory pages?

? I'm fairly certain the k380 isn't a full size keyboard? If you don't demand much frequency and precision from your mouse movement, a K400+ works fine with the SD and is what I used..

For a decent combo, the MK540 is a decent basic set which I used at work because I hate typing on laptop keyboard. Pretty robust and should survive commute so long you can bag up a full-sized keyboard. If you top up a little more, you can get the MK545 which have 2 side buttons on the mouse. Not too sure about the pricing for them at your side but should be under 100 euros I believe..

I disagree. Most of the games I've played don't have framecap or don't allow for 40fps cap. Some of them have but are proportional, so you need to change in-game settings every time you switch to handheld@40Hz, while the gamescope is always accessible. Also, your argument against it doesn't have any ""because it's going to be worse"", it's just ""I don't think it's necessary"", so I don't understand why you'd be against it as it doesn't hurt your experience if you don't use/need it.

jgxiq2g,"> dont run unofficial ISOs

This is good advice when talking about Windows or another closed-source OS. But it's a pretty bad take when it comes to Linux and other open-source OSes. Forking a distro or a piece of software and making your own version with specific changes is part of the very fabric of open-source development, and all those changes *must* be visible because the resulting fork must also be open-source (anyone with programming knowledge could easily look into your source code and see if you added anything malicious).

Valve themselves have made 'unofficial' software and ISOs many times -- Proton is their own 'unofficial version' of an existing software called Wine, SteamOS 1-2 were 'unofficial ISOs' of Debian Linux, and now SteamOS 3 is based on Arch Linux. It's *all* 'unofficial'.

They're not the only ones either. Pop!_OS, for example, even goes further down the rabbit hole: it's an unofficial version of Ubuntu, which is itself an unofficial version of Debian. ~~And IIRC, ChimeraOS started as an unofficial version of SteamOS 2, which was an unofficial version of Debian.~~ *(Edit: Okay, I was wrong about that, it actually started as an Arch-based* ***clone*** *of SteamOS 2 that tried to mimic and improve upon Valve's ideas but didn't fork the code directly)*

So the fact that HoloISO is unofficial isn't the problem. It's unstable because it's run by a small development team, forked from an incomplete OS (yes, SteamOS 3 runs fine on the Deck, but isn't really *ready* for other systems yet), and trying to implement major features that don't exist in the distro it's forked from. HoloISO may never get there before valve releases SteamOS 3 for general use. Or it may become a separate-but-similar distro, like ChimeraOS, and keep being developed and updated along-side SteamOS.

jguyqij,"Didn't work. The game mode shortcuts for ryujinx still won't work fully. Just to clarify, my switch games function fine. I'm trying to set it up so that I can launch my switch games directly from game mode without having to select them in the emulator first. Take BOTW as an example.


I have the shortcut to BOTW in my game mode ""recently played"" games.


I go to open it after setting its ""Launch"" properties to launch directly from yuzu (yuzu.sh)


BOTW loads directly after I launch it. It doesn't go to yuzu for me to open it, it just skips yuzu entirely and goes straight to the game, no hassle. (This is what I want with sparks of hope)



If I select ""ryujinx.sh"" in the BOTW launch  properties instead, then launch it, it half works. I get sent to the ryujinx emulator, and I am forced to load the game from there (this is not what I want).



I am trying to get Sparks of hope to launch directly from game mode. Ryujinx currently is able to run it far better than yuzu, so I can't use the yuzu.sh command line to launch it immediately from game mode, which sucks, because if i use yuzu.sh to run my switch games directly from game mode, it ALWAYS WORKS. Yes. I am aware this particular game is cursed emulation, and that emulators struggle to run it. However, I have the game running almost perfectly through ryujinx, which is why I want to be able to launch the game from game mode through a ryujinx shortcut. 




Right now, I can open ryujinx itself, select sparks of hope, and launch it with no issues for the most part. I want to skip the emulator entirely and just launch the game itself from game mode. However, it simply won't fully work.",SteamDeck

jgun4td,"Anyone saying you're going to kill a microSD in a matter of a couple of months from running Windows on it is talking out of their ass and doesn't know anything. Many people, including myself, are doing this exact thing and lo and behold, the microSD is still good.

While it's true that microSD has less TBW (which is how flash media lifespan is measured) than SSDs, it's still in the neighborhood of 150+ TBW, and you're just not even remotely going to hit that running Windows for gaming purposes. I'm not sure where people get this idea that Windows is just writing stuff constantly, but that's not remotely the case. Windows is designed to run on SSDs and constant writes are just as problematic there. There's scenarios where you can kill a microSD quickly, such as running a web server off it, but those same scenarios would kill an SSD as well. It would just take a little longer. If you're going to throw 150 terabytes of written data in a couple of months, you'd be swapping SSDs every year. That's obviously not the case.

So the program scans all sub-folders in ""shadercache"" and ""compatdata"".Scanned sub-folders have gameid as name.  
You use that gameid to compare with SteamStore and if you get a result, it is a Steam game, if you get no result, it is a non-Steam game.  
You separate those 2 results and put them in ""STEAM"" and ""NON-STEAM"" lists of your program.  
Deletion happens based on what is selected in the lists and by gameid.

In my opinion no?

If Proton 8 exists, and no game you have is using 7 go ahead and get rid of it & just run  games on Proton 8..

I set my default to Proton Experimental so I don't have to ever think about it, but for games like Sophie DX(patch notes for Proton 8) if it's not going to benefit from future Proton versions, I'll lock it to the best version at that time to save myself from gaving to download Proton EX updates.

Now if you ever have an issue, using an older Proton could help your issue?

But Proton is really, really flawless these days. We are realistically getting pretty close to actually running the entire Steam Library.

**TL;DR** / / *Think of Proton as like a Driver Update.

^(*btw I'm not saying it is a driver update before someone tries to to correct me, i'm merely simplifying it so it's easier to understand.*)

*Proton 7.0 released 1yr ago and was when SteamOS 3 & the Steam Deck were still in their infancy, many games didnt run & SteamOS was largely in Public beta.*

*Alot has changed in that yr with Proton 8, we're at SteamOS 3.5, Steam Deck has a major driver update being Mesa 23.1 & Proton 8 can better utilize said driver & Valve has essentially accumilated all of their fixes of the last year into Version 8 Stable.*

jgr2r6c,"In terms of functionality, EA's launcher at least does something, which is all I was talking about. They're both bad for the Deck irregardless, but that's not exactly what I was talking about.

At least with EA's launcher you can buy/download games, it has its own achievements system, social system, etc. It does \*something\* and can be justified (not by much). 2K's launcher literally does nothing except a ""play now"" button. No extra features, every single thing in the launcher just redirects you out to a website, or back to Steam/Epic.",SteamDeck
jgrm55x,If I hand them my data to harvest can I get rid of the launcher,SteamDeck
jgnysz0,"Yup, works great in Doom Eternal.",SteamDeck
jgr4vei,"Yea figures as much.

Seeing the commits having hardcoded app IDs [like this](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/blob/4a3731c3d951fb8ea78a8d08d973d5de9d07db79/proton#L988) for custom workarounds seems pretty unsustainable.

jgr54kz,"Sorry, but that's not true. The 2K Launcher is literally the same as the EA Launcher - it's a storefront to get people to buy more games. You may not see that side of it as much on the Deck, but it's a store. The EA Launcher that's used on the Deck doesn't even tie much into the EA architecture, that I'm aware-of, so it doesn't even use the Social System or Achievements.

All third-party launchers are exactly as bad as the rest. None are better than any others, and none provide any features that shouldn't be integrated into Steam for games launched from Steam. It's stupid and should be banned.",SteamDeck

Practically: all the proton versions inside the storage settings are basically extra proton versions installed by the users (compatibily mode, force another version of proton etc...).

jgmpcgp,Large deck 😉,SteamDeck
jgmrui1,Good point. Glazing and spot putty to infill is also good for surface finishing but honestly that layer height texture might add some grip.,SteamDeck
jgq45sm,neat il have a little look when I get back from work.,SteamDeck
jgzuec2,"My second print attempt failed at ~3/4 of height and it turned out the grip is even more handy with this size. It's smaller, it is less fragile since it has less thin walls, but it still fits perfectly. 

In fact I have made 3 prints with PLA 0.4 nozzle, 0.2 layer height, 0.4 2xWall, 200°/60°. Here are my notes

- first attempt was printed horizontally and broke immediately due to bad layer adhesion and wrong layer orientation

- second attempt printed vertically failed at 3/4, turned out to be the most handy version. It failed because the model fell of the bed, the contact patch with the table was way too small

- third attempt printed vertically with small negative z offset in Cura so that the contact patch is slightly bigger, this version has a small flat surface on the bottom. This version also cracked a little bit because of layer adhesion, but still works ok.

And here are my suggestions for v2:

- Consider making it smaller: 3/4 of height is quite ok
- Consider slightly thicker walls if It does not affect required flexibility. I'd personally try to remove as much thin walls as possible
- Make indents around trackpads slightly wider, +2-3mm would be super
- Make a little flat surface 1-2cm² on the bottom for better bed adhesion, the grip would still be comfortable for hands

Besides that the grip is super handy when playing with trackpad/gyro. Thank you again

UPD: A friend of mine is working on a remix. I'll share it  on printables when it's done

It’s a common thing that happens when the Steam is unable to access the SD card - usually it’s caused by the card being ejected while still being read, but not necessarily. The Desktop Client does the same thing with external drives.

To check: Desktop Mode> Client> Settings> Downloads> Select the Download Library option.

From there re-add the SD card Steam Library Folder found there. It should open in the correct location on the card. 

Also, if the Client added/created a new blank library, you can just delete that after re-adding the old one. 

After all that, your games should be working as normal, just keep an eye on the card.

I glitched once like that, tried to readd the microSD to steam library from options to no avail. Then i realized after readding the card to my library i had two SteamLibrary folders containing a steamapps folder and a libraryfolder.vdf file. The newest folder had the steamapps folder empty.

jgrzkvy,"GoW has a memory leak, it affects all hardware that has integrated graphics. If the game crashes after a set amount of time playing it's usually that you ran out of RAM/VRAM. When I played it, I would crash between 45min and 1 hour of gametime. Lowering texture quality can sometimes let you squeeze by, but since you already said you tried that I'd recommend increasing your swap file size. It looks like you already have increased it some (your screenshot shows 14.2 GB of RAM + 6.5 GB of VRAM for 20.7 GB total, the deck normally only has 17GB available including default 1GB of swap). 

I upped my swapfile to 16GB for the game, but 8GB would probably be enough. As usual I'd recommend Cryoutilities for increasing swap since it's the easiest way for most users. I've also heard that some of the other cryo tweaks (like huge pages) help with slowdown on the beaches of the elf realm where performance tanks for some reason, although I can't confirm that from personal experience.",SteamDeck

no its called its inaccurate. that shit is normally caused by cryos trash and will even display higher values than 16GB even without a swap file. you really need a better understanding of how swap works. it is not ram and can not be used as such as the name suggests it SWAPS",SteamDeck

jgs4jh3,"Man I just realized you're the anticryo guy on every thread, probably don't need to waste my time arguing with you.

The simple fact of it is that I couldn't play GoW without crashing when I hit 17GB of reported RAM + VRAM used. After increasing my swap I never crashed again in GoW, even at much higher reported levels of RAM + VRAM used. I don't think people care about the technical differences between swap and RAM that much, what ultimately matters is it made the game playable for me and I hope it will for OP too.",SteamDeck
jgsb6zb,Would you look at that. You’re wrong. AGAIN. Op hasn’t installed cryo yet.,SteamDeck
jgs2erv,I completely agree with you that it should run on launch giving that it’s deck verified. I was disappointed to say the least lol,SteamDeck
jgs3bsk,There are a lot of reports of it crashing for people. I think people targeting higher frame rates are less likely to have issues due to lower texture quality/etc reducing VRAM usage. However if you're playing at 30FPS with high quality textures (or possibly just original quality) you can easily run into out of memory crashes.,SteamDeck
jgs3xhs,which also means you havn't changed the swap file either still making it inaccurate values if we did assume the swap could be used as ram (which it can't),SteamDeck
jgs4phj,i play it with no swap file with no crash. point is you think the swap can actually be used to increase the vram and ram usage beyond their limit which is just plain wrong. thats my problem with your claim,SteamDeck
jgsidj9,good job looking over the word normally and applying it to always instead,SteamDeck
jgsm81c,Well I set my settings to low to get a consistent 40 to 45 fps so maybe i won’t run into issues.,SteamDeck
jgs43s6,Honestly it seems like you’re just here to argue lol,SteamDeck
jgs5xne,"I suspect some people are able to get by with lower texture quality to lower the VRAM usage, seems like people targeting higher fps are more likely to get through the game without crashes, where people using original or high quality textures are the ones more likely to have out of memory crashes. OP said they already tried lowering their settings though, so I'm suggesting the other fix I know of.

Using swap to work around high ram requirements isn't that usual though, I've been experimenting with different AI stuff on my desktop and using giant swap files is often needed to load the models into memory. For example the chatGPT-like model I'm experimenting with right now requires at least 60GB of RAM. Since most home users don't have that much, the official recommendation is to use a giant swap file to make up the difference. I only have 32GB of RAM so loading the model requires a 30GB swap file for example.",SteamDeck
jgsmb7c,"Do you like being wrong or do you have poor reading comprehension? If the bug is present before cryo being installed that obviously means it’s not “normally” caused by cryo, it’s “normally” caused my something else and you only noticed it while having a hate boner for a set of tweaks with a “smarter-than-everyone” attitude.",SteamDeck
jgs4e4s,um its called logic even if we did assume what he said was correct even though it isn't you would be able to use 17GB max. so again as stated the values are inaccurate,SteamDeck
jgs6mkl,I don't use a swap file on my steam deck period. huge swap files for games are things from the days of 2GB or less of ram and are absolutely worthless. very demanding apps are a different story. but again my point was your false claim of that 20GB+ being due to a swap file. a swap can NOT be used in that way it can not replace ram it has its own place on the right of the memory that shows how much swap data is being stored to swap in and out as needed. the 20GB is an inaccurate display of memory simple as that. misinformation like this comes from cryo telling people that you can inflate vram size using a swap file which is just a load of shit,SteamDeck

jglj3p5,"I'm curious what the concern is here... is it criminal liability? or retribution from Valve? or ethical concerns?  
Generally a charge of receiving stolen goods would require proving you knew or had reasonable suspicion the item was stolen. When buying from a reseller it's good practice to ask for proof of purchase. Even if they fake it, you have reasonable evidence you believed the item to be genuine. Also look for obvious signs like selling without the charger, or any markings or ownership.

As for Valve, I don't think there's any evidence of them blocking stolen hardware, though I've seen posts suggesting they reached out to some people to ask for details on how they came to own suspected stolen devices (and that seemed to be about fraud prevention and identifying supply chain issues).

Obviously ethical is harder to dispute, but I think following good practices for safe transactions and walk away if anything feels off is about all you can be expected to do there, unless you just avoid purchasing anything from any kind of second-hand market.",SteamDeck

jgtfe4m,"These issues can be caused by the emulator, the rom, the specific game, or your Deck itself.

In my experience the majority of the issues are due to just how the game runs when emulated. For example, I was playing Area 51 through PCXS2 and encountered significant graphical glitches when using the Vulkan renderer. When changing to the software renderer, it fixed the issue. 

Sometimes performance can be improved with modifications to cores via the Power Tools plugin (which Emudeck can install for you) or by adjusting the emulator’s settings. 

My recommendation, before changing anything in the emulator settings or Power Tools, is to research how well whichever game you’re emulating runs on Duckstation, PCXS2, etc. Normally you’ll find a post, article, something in the wiki, etc to provide a workaround for a problem.

However, some games just….won’t run well or work at all. I was trying to emulate Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects through PCXS2 and it would not load past the main menu. Had to emulate the game through Dolphin (the GameCube emulator) just to get it to work.",SteamDeck

Personally, I prefer Lutris because I've been successful in installing [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) games, GOG, and Epic Games (probably others i.e. Ubisoft/EA Origin? haven't tried but assuming it's possible). Heroic covers GOG/Epic Games so it's just two platforms.

Lutris is just a tool that helps you download and install OTHER launchers, like GOG Galaxy and EGS.

Both can install and manage Proton prefixes and work alongside Steam.

Cloud saves vary from game to game, and most use their publisher's launcher to handle and manage them. Also, depending on the game, you may be required to install their stupid launcher because of DRM. 

By using Heroic, you're less likely to need another launcher, because GoG is committed to not requiring DRM... but that launcher may be required for cloud saves.

You can also manually do your own ""cloud saves"" by using cloud storage and scripts to backup saves. Use pcgamingwiki to find the save files.",SteamDeck

jgv76mt,"HoloOS is irrelevant to this conversation, because it's not made or supported by Valve and is very much a use at your own risk kind of deal. There is no guarantee it would actually work, and if it doesn't, tough luck. This all is very different from what OP is talking - active collaboration and official support for a device.",SteamDeck
jguyfaz,"Which is why I'm sure some competitors will not touch SteamOS because that helps Valve more than it helps them. Selling hardware at a loss and making up the difference in software sales is a very old strategy in the game industry. The only way this would make sense for any competitor is if Steam was the only PC store front available which it obviously is not.

But considering Steam is available on every major OS and Big Picture Mode is basically the Steam OS front end now I don't see any reason why any competitor would jump on supporting SteamOS natively when some of the biggest benefits of it are already available to them.

The biggest benefit to supporting Windows over SteamOS is that not only will the user still be able to run everything available on Steam, they can natively run games from any other store as well as titles that's simply not supported on Linux since Windows support is still leagues ahead of Linux support.

The competition natively supporting SteamOS, cool story but no. I don't see it unless MS does something very stupid with Windows or an OEM comes to hate MS.",SteamDeck
jgvrr3t,"1. OEM licenses for Windows are not that expensive. It doesn't significantly affect the cost. The competing handheld devices are more expensive, not because they use Windows, but because, unlike Valve, they actually need to make profit on the hardware. 

2. It is actually exceedingly rare for a company to be good at both software and hardware. You can count on one hand the companies that have successfully bridged the gap. Even Valve mostly produced hardware flops until the Steam Deck. It took them a lot of time, R&D and failures to get where they are now. It's really not a situation of other companies can just make their own Linux distro optimized for gaming. They choose Windows because that's the path of least resistance.",SteamDeck

2) Copy **doom2.wad** to **/home/deck/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom**

3) Copy brutal wolfie or brutal doom somewhere, internal ssd or sd-card

4) Install/run FlatSeal and make sure GZDoom has filesystem access to /run/media/mmcblk0p1 (*if you have brutal wolfie/brutal doom on sd-card*)

5) make a script using Kate that contains the following and save it wherever you put the brutal wolf/doom mod, in my case its in a Brutal-Wolf folder on the SD-Card.

`#!/bin/bash`  
`cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1/Brutal-Wolf`  
`flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file BW.pk3 BW-HUD.pk3 BW-UpscaleGfx.pk3`

Rightmouse the script, look for file permissions, click ""Make Executable"", rightmouse the script and ""Add to Steam"", you probably did this in desktop mode so return to gaming mode and look for your fresh new entry, click it and see if it works, it ""should"" as thats exactly what i did.  If you use the SteamGridDB Decky plugin then add your artwork/etc and you ""should"" be done.

But they're also a real pain to use when you're used to wireless ones, and the Deck is much lighter than a home console, so accidentally pulling the cord might result in the Steam Deck falling to the floor rather than the controller cable unplugging...

For those reasons, I'd definitely suggest a DualSense or DualShock4 (which, incidentally, can more closely match the Deck's built-in controls since they have gyro and trackpads).",SteamDeck

jgshu3k,How would the vpn help?,SteamDeck
jgsisgj,"I use wireguard on my Steam Deck to route all traffic that would be local back to my home network. This allows me to connect to my NAS remotely. Since Chaiki connects to your console via a local network (like [192.168.1.200](https://192.168.1.200) for example), the VPN would act as a bridge to create that local network when you aren't home. Essentially a VPN creates a 'local network' between your remote device and local network even when you aren't actually locally connected. So it would go: Steam Deck --> External WiFi --> VPN --> Local Network --> PS4/5.

&#x200B;

OpenVPN will definitely be the easiest to setup of the two, and has wider support, even on common retail routers, but I would say the performance of wireguard makes it worth running over OpenVPN.

https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7D01-D2DD-D75E-2955

The second list has actual commands in which you'll type something like ""PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 %command"" into the launch options.

You will still have to hop around to find more of the commands, but hopefully these give you a good starting point!

You can set it to hide everything except titles you’ve specifically whitelisted.

What I do is mix it up. Mid to long games broken up by shorter ones that are quick and enjoyable. Keeps me feeling like I’m making progress without getting bogged down in all the super deep RPGs out there. 

Avoid live service games. League, Destiny, WoW, and FF14 are the reason my backlog got so deep in the first place.

Humble bundle sends you steam keys. Just pay the minimum you need (adjustable slider, you can make it higher if you want to contribute more to charity) and that’s it.

There is also the current ongoing [humble choice](https://www.humblebundle.com/membership/home) that is a subscription for $12 a month but you get sent steam keys that you keep forever. You can also pause and cancel the subscription at any time as long as you remember to do so. This month’s humble choice is really good, death stranding and Rollerdrome alone for $6 each is an absurd deal.

A pro tip with humble choice is if you pause a month, and pause the next month, humble will beg you to come back with a $4 off coupon. So I essentially got all those games there for $8 :).

jgodmdz,"The reason is that VSync forced the game to refresh at a rate evenly divisible into the monitor refresh rate while the framerate cap just caps fps. So if you’re playing at, say, a 60fps screen refresh rate with VSync on, you can only get 60, 30 or 15 fps from VSync. If instead you cap fps at 30, you can receive anywhere from 1-30 fps, so when you get fps drops you’re dipping down to say, 27 or 28 fps, as opposed to 15, which is the next evenly divisible fps VSync could have chosen.",SteamDeck

jgpldfn,"I’m in my mid-thirties now. When I was a teenager, it was right around the time DSL internet connections were starting to become popular, so a lot of people still relied on dialup. My mom was a crazy religious nut job, but my grandparents gave us a computer. I discovered AOL CDs at Burger King. I had a lot of fun trolling their chat rooms with my online friends. It was all fun and fairly harmless stuff - just saying random shit to confuse the adults and disrupt the conversation. 

Anyway, my mom didn’t like that I talked to people online, so she got a parental controls program from Yahoo. It also restricted me to a single hour of online time per day. Of course, that didn’t work for me. It only took me a day of that shit to order a Ubuntu CD. It came about a week later. I booted from CD and entirely bypassed her parental controls, since they were *installed* on Windows. 

She never could figure out why I was always online but never triggered her program to lock me out.",SteamDeck
jgpy25s,"I'm in my thirties and I know about Linux for a very long time. At least 15 years I'd say. As soon as I had my own laptop and got frustrated with Windows (And there is a lot to be frustrated about with it), I started experimenting with Linux.  I'm not even close to have experienced it since it's begining, but I did witness the shift in mentality regarding this OS over the years. I saw it going from something really obscure that nobody knows/cares about except a couple of nerds on the internet to seeing it used in a more mainstream setting. It's still somewhat obscure for a lot of people, but not nearly as it was back in the days. Today I still use Windows out of convenience (The office suite is provided to me for free and it dosen't have a desktop version on Linux) and for most of my gaming, but my laptop is running Manjaro (which is based on Arch Linux, like Steam OS)

Fun fact I was laughed at 10-15 years ago when I was enthousiastic about finding out the very few games that had a Linux port and/or were playable with Wine or PlayOnLinux. I always hoped and dreamed about a Linux gaming machine. And now it's here and it's amazing! 

I installed a couple of different Linux distributions on my PC when I was experimenting (mainly different flavors of Ubuntu and Fedora) but I ended up settling with Manjaro a couple years ago and it's still what I'm using. Linux is not much more complicated to install than Windows if you follow a guide. If anything I often find it easier to troubleshoot than Windows. I would describe my IT skills at a 5 (from 1 to 10). I'm not that good with tech but I know how to Google my issues and how to try things out. 

Finally if I was certain that all the games I currently like to play on PC had good native Linux ports or a near perfect performance with a compatibility layer like Proton or WineI would definitely ditch Windows completely and migrate to Linux. I'd probably stick to Manjaro or maybe I'd challenge myself in building a kickass Arch Linux gaming PC. Unfortunately we are not there yet. Maybe one day.",SteamDeck

jgrdk1s,"I am a Senior Security Architect and have been in Information Security (Identity Management) for over a decade now, starting off in engineering (Oracle Identity products) at a very large F100 company, and eventually moving into IAM security architecture.  In my spare time/hobby time, I muck around with my homelab, testing various security designs and concepts, or just spinning up useful apps in docker.  I also dabble in game development here and there.  I would rate my IT skillset at 10.  

In any modern enterprise, a large majority of your OS spread is Linux under the hood.  Usually some flavor or RedHat, though the tide is shifting to more FOSS alternatives.  

At home, I have two personal devices running Windows 10/11...I've lost count of the number of PCs we have, physical or virtual.  If you just count physicals, I've got a few dozen PCs/servers.  One of the Windows rigs is a gaming rig that I haven't touched in about a year, but when I get a chance, it's getting wiped and Ubuntu 22 loaded on it.  I've found that to be the easiest (for me) to set up as a Linux gaming device.   The other Windows device is the Lenovo Legion 5 I bought as a mobile workstation late last year.  It dual boots Ubuntu 22.  The only reason I leave Windows 11 on it is because Lenovo's warranty stuff only works on Windows.  So, if I need service or warranty support, I'm booting it back to Windows to do that.  

I honestly hate using Windows, especially Windows 11, which I find to be somehow even more bloated and clunky than 10.  My Lenovo Laptop with Win11 pre-installed, on first boot, was consuming 9GB of the installed 16GB (I upgraded it to 64GB, not because of Windows bloat, but because it's a necessity for game dev stuff and virtualization).  I ran debloat tools, removed a bunch of the shitware, but still couldn't get it to cold boot Windows 11 without consuming 7GB of the available RAM.  I'm sure there's more stripped down images I could use, but I don't see a point in bothering with that, if the user experience is still garbage.  The forced Microsoft account registration thing in Win11 (and Win10 on new installs) is pure nonsense, and my Lenovo sat unused for 2 days because I was busy and didn't have time to look up how to bypass the requirement.  Eventually I did, and have a local account.  ""OS as a Service"" is not the one-size-fits-all that Microsoft intends it to be, and I'm not going to have my PC locked because I can't ""log in with Microsoft"".  

The SteamDeck got my attention when it was announced it would be a Linux OS, and that Valve was trying again with SteamOS.  I had known of Gabe's desire to pry PC gaming out from under the Microsoft boot for a long time.  I believe he mentioned it back in the Steam Machines days.  Especially as they were pushing SteamOS2.  I agree with him that letting one vendor control the entire gaming market (a lot of the APIs for DX are used in the XBox as well.) isn't healthy for the industry, developers, or the consumer.   I immediately jumped on the SteamDeck during the day one pre-ordering last year and got one, my wife also got one.  I really hope Linux gaming can continue chipping away at the Windows/MS/DX stranglehold on gaming, and we can start to see some real innovation in the space with non-proprietary, universal APIs that work across a range of operating systems and hardware types.  And I think Valve is uniquely positioned to drive that forward.  The SteamDeck is as much a gaming device to me as it is an investment in Valve's efforts to push Linux gaming forward.",SteamDeck

jgsn6z6,"whats inside the copper is just alcohol. you can use low temp paste solder to low temp weld that to whatever, i wouldnt bother on the Deck, not much room anyways.

what does work rather well is very simple; repasting your APU (cpu/gpu die), and the jsaux backplate also helps dissipate more heat.

Problem is that lower APU temps also means lower fan speeds and thusly higher temps on ram and other IC's, whereas the APU will be cooler due to less airflow from lower fan speed.

You can mitigate this by using thermal putty on the ram and IC chips to mate them to the heat shield which is then mated to the jsaux backplate, which is a PITA, but would help....



...Or, you can use Decky and the Fantastic plugin to create a custom fan curve, bumping speeds up slightly, along with PTM7950 and/or jsaux backplate.


I decided to see what i could do to mine tempwise...

PTM7950 dropped my APU temps about 6c, and the Jsaux backplate dropped them a further 6c. I also undervolted by -40mv across the board, tested for stability, and bumped back up to -35mv.

I was seeing temp spikes up to 98c on my Deck with Valheim and Hitman 3, at 20c ambient, within just 10 minutes, and thats with fan roaring at 6800rpm or higher. T98c is right at the threshold of thermal throttling, which is 100c iirc, with 105c being automatic shutdown temp/tjmax.

Since repasting, puttying, undervolting, using Decky/Fantastic for a 10% higher custom fan curve on the OLD fan speed, and the Jsaux backplate, the max temp ive seen is now 83c at 20c ambient, with the fan at a much saner and quieter 6100rpm, and it took 20 minutes to hit those temps.

The paste job on mine was pretty bad, but 15c cooler is a hell of a difference, and i confirmed the temps on RAM and IC's remain 5-7c cooler than stock with the fan curve bumped up, even charging while playing. I butchered a backplate to test RAM and IC temps with a laser thermometer so i could have the backplate on and get temp readings with the laser thermometer.

That said, the Deck is good to 100c before it throttles, so no need to worry unless yours is 95c or higher after sustained sessions.

I enjoy tinkering and working on thermal solutions, and for about 3 hours worth of work and testing, im glad i did it, but like i said, i had much higher temps on the exact same games as a buddies' deck (89c) and my sisters' deck (91c) with exact same settings/location/time, theirs also took longer to reach those temps, about 20 minutes.

Ive since repasted, undervolted, adjusted Fantastic curves, and installed jsaux backplates on their Decks, and now all 3 are within margin of error on Valheim and Hitman 3, cruising along in the high 70's/low 80's with fans under 6400rpm, same version, settings, ambient temp etc, after 30 minutes of Valheim and Hitman 3 waking around in circles.

Once i had done all that to mine, it only took about 15 minutes to repaste and install the new backplate.

I spent about 40 minutes to undervolt and test stability on both of theirs as well.

The jsaux backplate does get hot on the heatsink, max ive seen is 49c with laser thermometer, which is uncomfortable, but its out of the way of your fingers. For me, its a non-issue.",SteamDeck

jgydfov,There’s a way to fix the connection error issue for MelonDS. The thing that causes the issues is the bios. More specifically the lack of bios or an incorrect setup. Is the bios set up correctly? Is the bios for ds in a folder in the bios folder?,SteamDeck

jgys46d,Alright. If you tried everything I’m not sure what could be the issue for you. This happened to me before and I was eventually able to fix it by changing the location of where retroarch looked for the ds bios.

It’s weird, ff was working fine on overworld on melonDS. The FF barely works even in battle on Desmume, to the point that the change is negligible. Either way, not a huge deal.

If you want to cheat in an item I suggest using PKHex. Seems to work well on Steam deck. One last question. Are you using Retroarch or the DeSmuME app and MelonDS app?

The only reason I've even used other brands is for 1TB cards, which Samsung doesn't offer.

I mentioned Kingston because you listed it as one of the most reliable, and aside from no name cards that obviously fail often, it's actually the only brand I've seen regular posts on this sub saying it failed on them. There's an occasional one here or there about a Samsung or even SanDisk, but nothing with the regularity of Kingston. Granted, that doesn't necessarily speak to anything in terms of broad scale reliability. Maybe for some reason there's just more people buying Kingston cards for the Steam Deck, so failure rates are skewed.

That said, this type of thing is hard to nail down. Even if there was a site that did reliability testing, it would require many thousands of cards to get an acceptable sample size, and any type of true torture test you could throw at them is going to pretty much take them all out. It's a tiny portable flash media, so it's more fragile than most people consider. My success with Samsung could be entirely down to the fact that it's always been purpose driven purchases. I bought them for a specific device and they stay in there forever. I'm not swapping them around, carrying them place to place, reformatting them constantly, etc. It's just one and done.",SteamDeck

>You don't need to set the UMA buffer size, and you don't need to change any of the settings altered by Cryoutilities, the defaults are already properly set for the device based on the expected usage it will get.

You had me until here. Everything you said before is absolutely correct, but this is absolutely wrong. First, it's not just Cryobyte33. He gets credit for creating an easy tool and perhaps popularizing these settings, but the settings on offer have tangible benefit that is known and recognized to anyone who knows computers and especially Linux.

Valve set sensible defaults that are, for the most part, good on average across most games. However, they are by no means the optimum settings for every game or even most games. Take huge pages as example. That is disabled by default, because it notoriously can cause issues in some applications. Most Linux distros have it disabled by default. However, particularly in memory heavy games it is absolutely worth enabling and can both dramatically increase performance and prevent crashes. All of the settings in CryoUtilities are the same. Depending on the game, they are potentially very beneficial, even though in some instances they might do nothing or even negatively impact performance.

The problem is people swinging to one side of the pendulum or the other, saying these tweaks are never useful at all or that you should turn everything on all the time. They're additional tools in your toolbox. Use them when it makes sense.",SteamDeck

&#x200B;

this though I must correct. the system will only detect around 11GB if you set the vram to  4GB so it won't be able to use that 4GB for the cpu no matter what but it won't change how much vram is used either",SteamDeck

I get 40-50FPS in RDR2 with 256MB vram and no swap file",SteamDeck
jgro404,Its not a bug because it was part of an update so it would run better at the default steam deck settings. It was designed to work better with the BIOS being default.,SteamDeck
jgr4tl0,But yeah if you’re using steamOS then the OS should handle all that stuff.,SteamDeck
jgr7ec7,"Yes, as I said, I totally agree with the first part of the reply. The utility of changing the UMA frame buffer value is minimal at best, and even Cryobyte33's own videos show that it's pointless most of the time.

jgrixpg,"..... actually the reason I posted this. I was attempting to show that aside from the water issue, there's not really any detriment in leaving vram set to 4gb, whereas in Cryos video it shows a serious hit on performance.

I find having the cryo utilities enabled with 4gb vram helps a LOT with PS3 and Switch emulation, so I wanted to leave it enabled constantly rather than having to go into the bios every time I want to play RDR2.",SteamDeck
jgr88c9,"Well, first, my point was that you don't need Cryobyte33 to tell you these things and it is well known outside of just one YouTuber. Second, 3 FPS for a game running at 30 FPS is a 10% improvement, and actually is quite noticeable and may be the difference between playable and not. Third, I have no idea where you get that it makes no sense, because it actually makes perfect sense in many cases.

jgrksj2,"When you start downloading a game for the first time, Steam will ask you where you want to install it– the internal storage, or an SD card if you have one. It may also appear under Settings > Storage, but I’m not sure if it shows games you’re currently downloading.

When you download a game, Steam has to fetch all the data from the internet *and* write it to your device. In the Downloads graph, the blue bars show the download speed, while the green line represents the write speed. It looks like your write speeds are slower than your download speeds– so maybe your microSD card is limiting how quickly you can download something.

You can test this out by installing something to your internal storage instead, which should be faster than your SD card. If installing to your internal storage results in a faster download, then maybe your SD card is too slow.",SteamDeck
jgrmtma,Try the server nearest to you and then another one in a big city like new york. If they're both slow then just wait a few hours. The servers are probably just spreading downloads out.,SteamDeck

jgq3miq,"I ran into a problem Valve tech couldn't fix.
I moved games from internal 512gb to 512gb microSD - everything fine.

Moved some games back from microSD to internal for faster loading - failed on every count.

SD's were compatible, multiple SD's were used - same failure on moving back from SD to internal. Valve tech were stumped.

The only fix was to uninstall games & reinstalling on internal storage.

I use SD now only for smaller games or for larger games I've finished.
I don't know if the last OS update fixed it I'm not keen on downloading 500gb a fourth time - maybe it did.

So in theory moving from SD to internal in your case should work fine - but if you later want to put it back on SD to save valuable internal space that may fail or require uninstall & reinstalling.",SteamDeck

jgw12wh,"Yes PS5/Series X really upgrades some older games. Days Gone was amazing on PS5. Shadow Warrior 2 is upgraded on Series X through fps boost. But at the same time other back compat games do not have significant fps upgrades. Quantum Break and Ryse Son of Rome are examples. While they look good on series X, they are still only 30 frames per second the last time I checked. Both games I have played on steam deck both games look great there and both games play at around 48 frames per second on the steam deck. As well as the games mentioned in the initial post.",SteamDeck
jgoaj4x,"Both and neither are correct. The UMA frame buffer size is just the default VRAM allocation to the GPU. Regardless of what you set it to, the GPU can allocate up to 8GB of system RAM as VRAM. However, the CPU holds priority, so there are certain scenarios where the CPU could potentially starve the GPU of the VRAM it would like. This would obviously be something in the range of 1GB (the default) and 4GB, or it wouldn't matter anyways. If the GPU is already using more than 4GB, then this didn't come into play, and the UMA frame buffer setting ended up not mattering at all.

In truth, changing this value does very little if nothing. Because increasing the value means less RAM is available to the CPU at all times, it's encouraged to apply the swap fixes, and it's these, not the UMA frame buffer value, that accounts for increased performance in some games.

There is potential that it might help, depending on the game, but it's going to be a very small subset of games that feature just the right balance of needs from both the CPU and GPU simultaneously. Most of the reason the UMA frame buffer got popularized was because of Windows on the Deck. There at least was an issue with the GPU driver for Windows that prevented the VRAM from being dynamically allocated as it is on the SteamOS side. As such, with the default of 1GB, you literally only got 1GB, so setting it to 4GB instead obviously increased performance there. I'm not sure if that's even still an issue though.",SteamDeck
jgp72e6,"Some games are RDR2 it helps to have UMA at 4GB, other games like Borderlands 3 having UMA at 4 instead of default 1GB makes the game unstable and prone to crashes.",SteamDeck

jgo9ibq,Use 4gb,SteamDeck
jgoq9ue,"You're absolutely correct - of course, this view is not widely accepted in this subreddit due to a certain popular voice - but the UMA buffer is just a suggested default allocation and actual VRAM usage will shrink or expand automatically, with the CPU having absolute priority. Even if UMA is set to 4GB, the CPU can, under pressure, allocate just 1GB of VRAM anyways. 

Arguably, setting it to a very low number could have a small performance impact in games that shuffle a lot of data using the CPU - but for the vast majority of cases, and considering the aggregate result across many titles, it's a completely irrelevant setting to change.",SteamDeck

VRAM in the other hand, the only way to increase it is with UMA buffer.

What this means is that anything installed is done so in the user folder/partition and not the system one. So any changes you might make to the system itself (such as installing non flatpak system packages) will get wiped the next time the system updates.

That particular card, if it's legit, is A1 (which as I said, doesn't speak to anything of benefit, except to distinguish it from a higher performing A2 card). The real problem is that it's also U1, rather than U3, and depending on the application, that can make a significant difference.

I think it very much depends on your gaming background. I always preferred playing PC shooters with a keyboard and mouse, so I never got used to stick-aiming. Gyro with a horizontally-biased trackpad is the closest config I found so far to that keyboard/mouse feel. I continue to give Stick + Aim Assist a fair shot since most modern shooters default to that scheme when I install it on the Deck. Every time though, I end up being annoyed by the aim assist and dissatisfied with stick turning. I feel like I either have to choose between more control and turtle-slow turning speed, or faster turning speed but jerky control in the heat of battle. Stick + Gyro and Flick Stick + Gyro felt slightly better, but Trackpad + Gyro felt best for letting me do both fast and controlled turns and aiming with minimal movement.

I was also considering trying those fat stick cap/ring accessories, but realized I was perfectly happy with Trackpad + Gyro, and there was no point in spending more money and limiting my right stick when it comes to playing other games (or going through the hassle of removing it and replacing it each time).

If you're still willing to give gyro another shot, try having it activated by a bumper/paddle rather than simply placing your thumb on the stick/trackpad. That way it's less intrusive and you can use it only when you feel you need it.",SteamDeck

jgpi7oq,"I bought two cheap PS4 Dualshock controllers to use with my deck so my niece and I could splitscreen Portal 2.  They work great on the deck over Bluetooth.  I think if you tried your PS4 controller on your Deck you'll be pleasantly surprised by the results.  Plus the PS4 Dualshock 4 controllers have gyro sensors that the Deck is able to detect and use; I can't live without gyro and my understanding is that Xbox controllers still lack this feature.

And FYI: Windows support for Playstation controllers is *really* poor, and I think that's why you're seeing a lot of the problems you're seeing when using it with your PC.  Usually a Dualshock controller connected to a Windows PC will be seen by the computer as a generic gamepad.

I’d try some basic troubleshooting if you haven’t already including;

1) whilst ROR2 is open, open your settings - controller - test. See if you right joystick is working in the test. If it is then I’d be inclined to suggest there is a game software issue here

2) go back to ROR2 and go into settings. I think you can reset default settings there for controller. This is very basic troubleshooting I know but try it

3) hit steam button again whilst in-game, go to controller settings (the steam in-game control mapping), try re-mapping right joystick to say mouse.

4) go back in game, Test if your right joystick is now working as a mouse on all axis. If it is, then this is good sign.

5) go back to step 3, this time change right joystick assignment back to as right joystick. Check back in-game is it working now?

6) off all above fails, before you do more in-depth hardware/firmware troubleshooting, I’d try re-install your game. That is, if it right joystick works perfectly for other games etc.

The physics in FX3 (for Williams tables) were already head and shoulders above most other games, and I really haven't seen, felt, or read anything actually quantifiable on whether they're improved in FX. Again, not talking about Zen original tables (which I rarely play).

VR, I mean I guess. They've already had a VR version of their game. It was okay. If you really cared about VR I'd assume you'd have set up VPX.

Thankfully, Steam Deck isn't my primary platform to play the new FX now and it definitely isn't going to be as soon as Praydog drops that VR injector mod.

I'm not big into the Nintendo/Switch scenes, but what little research I've done reveals a general opinion that the performance of Switch games, even on the native Switch hardware, is just all over the place.  Some run amazingly well and some chug along like crap and struggle to maintain even 15 frames per second.  This translates into even worse performance under emulation.  Since Switch emulation is relatively new, some of this will be improved as the emulation techniques used mature.  Some of this is down to poor game optimization and so will not ever be fixed (*cough Pokemon Violet cough*).

I'm seeing the same pattern here taking crap about ""Nintendo fanboys"", too blind to take a look in the mirror.

Nobody cares if Deck can emulate some games. For one, they don't run better. Most run worse, and even for the games that run great, it's the same at best. But on a larger, heavier system without the OLED screen or tabletop or removable controllers or any of the benefits of just playing on the original hardware, and at half the battery life. And it's such a teeny, tiny percentage of people doing it, too. 

Like, so many games run worse, and you'll see fanatics that cherry pick games that get pretty close to running the same, and parade it around proclaiming how much ""Nintendo fanboys"" are jealous. When in reality... nobody cares. Even if 100% of games ran the same... nobody cares. 

If somebody wants to play a few games that can run mostly the same as Switch on Deck, knock yourself out. With all the bragging and taunting you'd think the average Deck user was a 12 year old child.

Switch emulation shines with dedicated vram that the Deck doesn't have. The HT is a bit hit and miss, and the 15 watt TDP is too low to boost core enough to get good framerates/frametimes and stay at even close to native resolution.

That said, both Yuzu and Ryujinx development seems to be catered more towards the games and systems that their retrospective early access/patrons care  are about :- Nintendo first party, but the issue with this is these are the games that have the least issues, bar Pokémon. The games that really need fixes get ignored.

You cared enough to reply. 

But even then saying ""no one cares"" is a downright lie. Emulation is one of the core reasons why the Steam Deck is so successful. I've had people who've never been interested in Emulation before getting a Steam Deck come to me asking for Emulation advice. 

>For one, they don't run better. Most run worse, and even for the games that run great, it's the same at best.

Here is the lack of self-awareness. There are many games that run better:

● Luigi's Mansion 3 can run at 40fps on Steam Deck and only 30 on Switch.

https://youtu.be/mxiDeShail8

● 3D World Bowsers Fury only runs at 30fps on     handheld mode on Switch but runs at 60fps on Steam Deck. 

https://youtu.be/w1Gk2S5Iob8

""Most run worse,"" care to provide some examples? Because every game I've run is either better or on par. 

>But on a larger, heavier system without the OLED screen or tabletop or removable controllers or any of the benefits of just playing on the original hardware and at half the battery life.

Everyone I've asked who has used the Steam Deck finds it far more comfortable than the Switch.

You can buy cases that add the ""tabletop functionality.""

I love how you ignore all the benefits the Steam Deck offers that the Switch doesn't. Like:

● Using any Controller you want. 

● Far better controls (No stick drift)

● Remote Play Streaming

● Full Screen Recording

Also what are these ""benefits of just playing on the original hardware""?

>Like, so many games run worse, and you'll see fanatics that cherry pick games that get pretty close to running the same, and parade it around proclaiming how much ""Nintendo fanboys"" are jealous. When in reality... nobody cares. Even if 100% of games ran the same... nobody cares.

Many people say the Deck's battery life is bad, but in native games battery life can actually be quite good with the right settings - I regularly get 3.5-4h in fairly modern titles (e.g. Elden Ring, Cyberpunk, Kingdom Come, Mortal Shell, Bleak Faith Forsaken to name a few), but Switch emulation may push harder than that even if you limit framerate?

See The Last of Us's garbage PC port because they could effortlessly take advantage of the PS5's hardware decompression, then watch the talk from some of Nixxes' developers about **how rough** it was getting Spider-Man working well on PC because of the differences between the platforms. Naughty Dog should've never released it like they did, and I'm not going to defend them, but there is a reason that the game is so CPU dependent right now and it's because of that hardware decoding on the PS5.

Yeah it'd be cool, but you don't even know what you're asking so it seems like a no-brainer. Directstorage will alleviate some of what I've mentioned above but you're then limited to nvme and if you want decompression then a very recent Nvidia gpu. I fall into both of those categories, but talk about a fraction of a fraction!

Imagine how many games you have to sell ""extra"" to make as much money as with their hardware, switch online and accessoires.

Breath of the wild sold 30+ mio units....a witcher 3 about 40 mio.....thats not that much difference if you think about the fact, that Witcher 3 is often sold for only 10€ and Zelda is always at least 40€ and Witcher 3 is 2 years older than Zelda.......

Mario Kart -> over 50+ million units sold. There has never been a pricedrop to this game under 40€........even other comapnies sell more games, its only cause of massive sales to 10€ or something.

Lastly with MK8, the video shows the best performing track, the first one of the first Cup. It is not representative at all. Go to the any of the DLC cups or any of the tracks with sand and you will have a different experience.

They would expand their market for their small pool of games by publishing Multiplatform, yes.

It would be pro-consumer for them to ditch their hardware and publish their games Multiplatform, but they make more money by making hardware and publishing their games exclusively to that hardware.

Those ‘battle pass’ expansions also do not account for anywhere near a majority of Nintendo’s profit.

EDIT: here is [a breakdown of Nintendo’s profit](https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1489147793558102016) from last year, showing over 50% of their profit came from hardware sales.  
Game sales made up 38% and NSO, DLC and digital only games combined only made up 7%.",SteamDeck

jgm5i5f,"> How much money did they lose because their published games were limited to their platform? 

I’m almost certain it’s not as much as they made by selling hardware and making profits off of every Switch game sold.  
Switches aren’t that expensive, most Nintendo fans own one. I’m sure game sales would be higher, but I don’t think they would be so much higher that it would increase their profits beyond what they make with their current business model.  
Compared to Multiplatform devs/publishers Nintendo don’t actually put out that many games per year. 

> They can still sell their accessories and make them compatible with Steam Deck / PC.  

There just isn’t a big market for that. Most PC players use KB+M, and those that use controllers use an Xbox or PlayStation controller or a retro controller like 8bitdo if they play retro (or retro style) games.  

Switch controllers are already PC and Steam Deck (and even iOS and Mac) compatible and I’m almost certain they haven’t seen a noticeable jump in peripheral profits from that.",SteamDeck

A lot of people seem to get confused by changing the aspect ratio, too, for some reason. 1280x720p is just going to give you black bars because it still can't be upscaled. It has to be less than native in both dimensions.",SteamDeck

jgoy2i7,"I understand that FSR includes sharpening like the ""Radeon image sharpening"" (or FidelityFX CAS). So if this is correct there should be some kind of benefit in running it even at native resolution. 

In my desktop I generally run RIS at default 80%~ (I don't use FSR) and always miss it when I switch to Ubuntu and I don't have the setting anymore (this is at 1440p. Not 720p tough). 

However, I haven't tested properly the SteamOS FSR option on the steam deck quick settings. I think I haven't noticed a difference there (just for the sharpening), maybe because it is only enabled at lower than native res.",SteamDeck
jgozwj6,"No, because at least how it is implemented at the SteamOS level, it is only engaged when upscaling. LCD displays can only display at their native resolution. If you feed it anything less, it has to use some sort of upscaling to bring it to native. That's what the slider is about in quick settings, and why the default is linear instead of ""off"". FSR is just offered as another option, but will never be used in any way unless the output resolution needs to be upscaled to native.",SteamDeck

jgqeib4,"Well, you have the first part correct. The other options won't do anything either, though. They all only activate when the output needs to be upscaled.

u/amenotef, I thought the same thing, I figured FSR would upscale the image and then downscale it to native res.It's for good for getting higher FPS or extend your battery life.

Doesn't appear to be substantial, but still interesting. According to the thread, support says it's a region-specific revision, or at least they are releasing there first.

Original thread: [https://tieba.baidu.com/p/8363052012?pn=1](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/8363052012?pn=1)

From what I can see, the changes are:

* New fan.
* New slightly different motherboard.
  * Mobo shape changed around the edge by the fan.
  * WiFi module has been moved out from under the M.2 slot.
  * RAM packages (unlabeled) and power delivery layout looks different, but components look the same?
* Heatsink retention bracket has different mounts, and commenter states there's no thermal pad between heatsink and EMI shield anymore.
* New EMI shield, can be removed without the silly tape flap.

Also odd is that the revision letters seem to be earlier letters? The mobo is marked REV:C as opposed to the current REV:E/F, and their controller daughterboards are marked REV:B as opposed to the more common REV:F. Wonder if it's somehow actually an older revision that got sold, or if I'm overthinking that. Production date according to the second commenter is February 15, 2023.",SteamDeck

Can't exactly tell the diameter of the fan since the blades extend further into the housing, but it would still seem bigger on Delta/Huaying than this fan. 

That said, the Delta was more noticeable mainly because the blade design produced a high pitch resonance that the Huaying design did not, rather than the difference in volume (although the Delta was indeed slightly louder). 

This was mitigated with foam on the backplate that pushes on the fan housing in the Q3 units and later.",SteamDeck
jgq7kzc,">The fan opening is very clearly bigger 

I do not spend most days with my deck disassembled to the point where I have the internal fan size memorized. There also isnt a side by side. So, no, it is not ""very clearly bigger"". 

I have my memory to go by, and scale isnt a memorable feature. A ""very clear"" difference, to me, would be if the fan had a 1 foot diameter. I would certainly remember and notice that difference. I'd also notice if they replaced it with a standard 80mm desktop fan.

I'm not arguing ""it's definitely not bigger"", I believe you when you say you see a difference. I'm just saying it's not obvious to me, and I think that's the case for others as well.

> it's very clearly the more traditional style of blower. 

Ok. I do not test the effects of various fan types and their effectiveness, so while I did notice it's a different cooler, I don't immediately know the performance changes.

Also, I've disassembled plenty of laptops; parts can be made crapily. The fact they they switched to a more traditional style of cooler, yes that is obvious. It is not obvious, to me, what the performance characteristics will be because it depends on the quality of that part. 

If you've zoomed in and figured out who makes it or something to know it's a quality part, please do share. In my experience, seeing that it's a standard laptop style fan only means it is cheaper and easier to find a replacement part.

>Why are people focusing on the heat sink

This is what my last post was addressing. Again, if you're seeing a huge change in performance due to the fan difference, great. I wont argue with you there. To me, the obvious difference is the heatsink and shield changes. You questioned why people were discussing the heat sink over the fan, and I addressed that, but it seems you took my words to mean ""the fan is not important"", which isn't the case.",SteamDeck

jgnm7qx,"Check out r/WindowsOnDeck.  You'll find a nice guide on how to get windows going but I wouldn't call it super beginner friendly.  You'll find a lot of negative opinions about running Windows on an SD card as it has a tendency to wear out the card (and load times are very slow).  

Booting to windows is also more complicated than just popping in a card.  Once it's set up as a bootable device, you'll have to hold vol + when booting to get to the BIOS options where you choose how to boot, or check out something like refind/clover to give you boot options for each restart.  I am dual booting windows on a partitioned 512 drive with SteamOS using rEFInd and I love it.

jgmroa7,"As far as I am aware, most ways that allow you to play Genshin inside SteamOS bypass the anticheat and leave your Genshin account vulnerable to banning. It's rare, but I don't want to take the even slight risk. I do as you've outlined above and run Genshin from a windows install stored on an SD card. It runs fine. No issues with the deck or the game. I just pop the SD card out when I don't want to be running windows. Valve doesn't care, since it's your deck. 

I DO however have to use [GlosSI](https://glossi.flatspot.pictures/) in order to use the controls, but it's a breeze to install now and even let's me use the back paddles.

Under normal circumstances, Genshin will not work in SteamOS. In general you'll want to assume that games with an active anticheat are not compatible with SteamOS, which you'll want to keep in mind because you're risking potential account bans if you try to make it work.",SteamDeck

It's a nice thing they put that here but I always end up pressing keys before spacebar, which I think might have something to do with the fact that a letter is inputted only AFTER releasing the click and not at its release as opposed to the back paddle.

jgom0pe,"* Spiderman: Miles Morales 8/10

Great game, tight controls, runs great on deck, but IMO it's a little short for the price point. Would highly recommend Spiderman Remastered if you haven't played it on PS4 already as it's only like $10 more and is a longer game. They both go on sale pretty often so I'd wait for one of those.

* Jedi Fallen Order 8/10

Runs pretty well on deck, must play if you're into Star Wars. It has a sequel coming out soon IIRC.

* Control 9/10

Fun gameplay, cool story, overall just great vibes from this game.

* Marvel's Midnight Suns 9/10

Played this game on a whim during it's free weekend and got sucked in. It's a tactical RPG (I think that's the term for it) like XCOM (I think the same studio might even have made or worked on it). Ran pretty well until like the last story mission when I had to turn some settings down but very fun if you're into Marvel and/or tactical games.


* Mass Effect Legendary Edition 10/10

Contains Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3. I haven't actually played them all on deck, currently working my way through the first one, but I played them all when they originally released and it's one of my favorite game series in general so having them all in a SD compatible remastered collection is a dream.

I also recently started playing Citizen Sleeper, it's a scifi point/click and resource management game. Lots of reading and stressful (the good kind) decisions but it's hardcore feeding my dopamine addiction.",SteamDeck

jglhq0m,"To explain the storage situation:

- the steam comes with an SSD, a Solid State Drive. This type of storage is the standard nowadays and uses no mechanical parts.
- It takes over the function of the “hard drive”, but the technology it uses is completely different which is why we refer to them as SSD’s and not hard drives.

- The steam deck has a MicroSD-card slot that can be used to increase storage capacity.
- SD stands for Secure Digital. It is not the same as an SSD. 
- SD cards have different speed ratings, these are standardized and you can look up the differences online. 

How quickly you run out of storage will depend on the types of games you end up playing. Indie games generally take up very little meaning you could likely install more than a hundred of them whereas installing 5 AAA games could fully fill up your storage.


Keep in mind that the 512 version comes with a matte screen, installing a glossy screen protector will nullify the purpose of this, whereas installing a matte screen protector may lead to extra blurry images. For this reason I would recommend picking the 64GB version and upgrading the SSD yourself, or choosing the 256 version and installing a larger MicroSD card.

Most of the other stuff I think has already been answered.

Enjoy!",SteamDeck

Memory card wise I use a mix of SanDisk 512s and 1TB, Samsung Evos and Integrals. Generally any U3 give faster performance which is great for the deck.

jgli9zs,"1. All decks have carrying cases included. 
2. Dock is a must imo. I recommend the official one.

5. For the 512gb deck get the JSAUX anti glare screen protector.",SteamDeck
jglq89g,"1. They all do
2. Depending on your needs, there are cheaper options, but if you prefer the simplicity of one made by Valve with guaranteed support, it's a fine choice
3. The official Dock comes with a power supply that's the same as the one that comes with the Deck, so you're alright on that front. A cheaper one may not, you can use the Deck's one or any third-party USB-C charger with PD3.0 and enough wattage (30W is enough for the Deck alone, but it can take 45W and I'd definitely want to have that if I was using it docked so there's overhead for the dock itself and any USB peripherals). And you'll want an HDMI cable, maybe ethernet if you have a suitable setup.
4. I have the 512GB and am nowhere near filling it up, but I've only got a couple of reasonably large games on there (Spider-Man, Elite Dangerous, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider) and a bunch of small ones - nothing really huge. Whether you need an SD card really depends on what you're going to be playing, and whether you're more of an 'install everything' kind of person or you play one or a few things at a time and then uninstall them. Don't have any SDs bigger than 32GB and haven't used any with my Deck so can't give any specific advice on that front.
5. Don't really use them myself, can't advise here.
6. Controller(s), headphones, powerbank maybe? I'd recommend at least 30W, don't necessarily need the full 45W if you're on a budget. I have a 22.5W and it does work, but the Deck complains about slow charging and it can exceed that wattage if you push it, which *may* lead to battery calibration issues (anecdotal only, not confirmed). 30W is enough to avoid the slow charging warning and covers the Deck's max power draw.

3. You'll need an HDMI cable and probably a charger for your dock (the Official Dock comes with a charger, but most 3rd party ones don't.)
4. With the way games are ballooning in size, you need an SD card, yes. Any decent-brand U3 A1 or U3 A2 card (A2 is better, mainly because it will write much faster, which matters for downloads) should work.
5. Up to you. I don't think they're necessary. If you get the 512 Deck, don't bother with a protector at all, because most of them are shiny and will just defeat the purpose of getting an antiglare screen.
6. Once you have your Deck, you can then decide if you need other stuff, like a kickstand case, or fancy third party charging bricks, or skins or whatever. The only accessory you truly need is an SD card, and in your case, a dock + controller.",SteamDeck

jgms8e4,"I'd echo this, I originally started looking at a Vita for remote play that also had some decent on the go games, but then realised to do remote play properly really you need the Hori case etc. That took me way into the £200+ range for console and case not to mention SD card adapters or memory cards etc...

So then I started looking at the android handhelds like the retroid pocket 3+, but then if that landed and import taxes hit it was creeping closer to £300... 

Steam deck was on sale for £314.10... no brainer for what it can do! Value for money (even with an SD card and 512GB SSD) all in I spent under £400, and got something WAY better than a Vita! Remote play, game pass, steam sales etc... I knew there would be tinkering to get some games to run and I was eyes open to the limits, but as a kid from the 90's that seen the evolution of gaming from just text response based games on an old PC (feel like it was on an old acorn or BBC micro...) the deck is an incredible bit of kit!",SteamDeck
jgmvyg3,"Absolutely. The Vita was honestly a great piece of hardware, and even though Sony royally messed things up with it, I still feel the Vita deserves a piece of gaming history. I loved my Vita. I even still have my OG OLED Vita (PCH-1000, it was 3G model! Lol). A few years ago I dug it out and dusted it off, realized it had the ideal old firmware version for exploitation, so I loaded it with everything I could. It kept me entertained for about a month, maybe longer, before I lost interest in it again - and that's even including the Vita2SD mod that lets you stick any size micro SD card in it, so space constraints were not a concern. Remote Play *performance* was at least decent with the Vita, although I never used the official app due to never having a PS4 back in the Vita's heyday, and being on an older firmware by the time I did have a PS4 (I didn't upgrade so I could keep my exploitable firmware). But control mapping was a big issue with the lack of L2/R2 shoulder buttons. The rear touchpad was cool and worked well for Vita designed games, but nothing translated well for DS4 emulation. When the Deck came out I definitely remember having a similar feeling to when the Vita came out. The idea that such a cool handheld was even possible, it was quickly overshadowed by how awesome the Deck is and how much more it can do.",SteamDeck

jgi3ldm,"You can effectively do that with Tailscale too.  Just have the Pi advertise the route to your local network. Then you get everything on your local network without going past the 20 device limit (or needing to install headscale). Tailscale also manages to get around some of the more restrictive public wifi systems. For example, Dunkin’ blocks my Wireguard VPN but not Tailscale. Starbucks allows both through.

You can configure your router to route packets for your tailnet back to the Pi so you can do bi-directional communication, but that’s a bit beyond this. I have not figured out how to use magic DNS like this yet.

Another side advantage I just remembered. I had my home network at 192.168.1.x last year and stayed at an AirBnB that also used 192.168.1.x for its network, this made my VPN not work as well. [Tailscale uses IP addresses in the 100.x.y.z range](https://tailscale.com/kb/1033/ip-and-dns-addresses/), which I’ve never seen a local network use before.

If the Plex server allows you to install Tailscale directly on it, go that way. If it does not, install it on another device on the network and make it a subnet relay.

Completely unrelated to Tailscale, another option is Cloudflare Tunnel. It will also traverse CGNAT and expose your Plex server to the public internet. The only limitation here is that you must have a subdomain. I have my own paid one, but I don't see why you couldn't use something like https://freedns.afraid.org/ to get a free subdomain. Cloudflare Tunnel is completely free, and it comes with free TLS too. I use it with [podsync](https://github.com/mxpv/podsync) to watch YouTube using my podcasting app and make the feeds available to my friends as well (which would be more hassle if we used Tailscale).

I'm not sure how well that would all translate while on a satellite connection. I know Starlink's impressive, but hey, you can give it a try anyway since Tailscale is free to use for this use case.

Your mileage may vary.

jgh5lw5,"Yeah this works. The problem is that most people don't have static IPs. You can work around that with dynamic DNS, sure, but that's lots of faffing about. Further to that, some people are forced to use ISP's router/modem which don't allow port forwarding or bridge mode, putting them behind double NAT. Finally, some people are behind CGNAT, which prevents any sort of direct inbound connection.

When you do that, if you run `tailscale status` it will show the machine that's a subnet router as active and advertising routes.

At that point, if you ping the PS from Steam Deck, it should be reachable. The connection gets sent to the subnet router machine, who forwards it to PS.

The clients are open source, but the control server is not.

Actually, without NAT punch-through, any server you connect to wouldn't be able to reply back to the specific client on the local network!",SteamDeck
jghhtg9,"It is possible. Tailscale server is used as a negotiation partner to set up a tunnel.

Basically:

Host X send UDP packet to remote server. When routers (with NAT) relay the packet, they open the ""source"" port for this UDP connection and put it in the packet as source port. When router (NAT) receives an UDP packet on this port, it will be relayed to Host X. That's how it is possible to use UDP connections behind NAT.

So, Host A send UDP packet to Tailscale, so Tailscale knows the source port of host A that allows to send UDP packets back to host A.
Host B does exactly the same.

Now, when Tailscale knows which are public IP addresses of networks with host A and host B and it knows which UDP ports were opened to the public that allow to relay UDP ""answers"" to host A and host B, this information is shared with client applications installed on Host A and host B. This way, host A can send an UDP packet directly to host B and vice versa.",SteamDeck
jghe24w,"It's because of how firewalls are setup most of the time.

Like you said, I wouldn’t expect this to be the result of your SSD swap. My guess would be that some in-game graphics settings could be used to lower power usage. 

If you use the most detailed overlay, it should show you what clock speed the GPU and CPU cores are running at. The GPU caps out at 1600 MHz, and each CPU core caps out at 3500 MHz. The overlay will have those clock speeds slowly turn to red as they reach those caps. I would play a bit with that overlay expanded to see how fast your GPU/CPU is running, and what speed they’re running at.

If your GPU is running too fast, you may be able to reduce power usage by tuning the in-game graphics settings. Otherwise you can manually clamp the GPU clock speed, or overall APU power usage, via Steam’s performance panel. For a turn-based game like DQXI, maybe lowering the refresh rate will still feel acceptable– and it’ll definitely claw back some battery life.",SteamDeck

I want a handheld. I have the Backbone controller for my phone. It scratched an itch and now I want to move up to a proper dedicated gaming device.

My problem is I want one that does it all. I want Steam. I want Xbox Game Pads. I want PS5 Remote Play. 

PS5 Remote play seems to be an issue with all of them from what I can find. I want a machine that can run it without sideloading or workarounds. Just use the app and I'm set. 

Very long way of asking do you know if there is a handheld like this? Maybe I'll get lucky when the RoG Ally releases.",SteamDeck

jh8vzsm,"Not rude at all boss. I came from the Dominican Republic  to the US a long time ago. In the DR I never had the chance to have a game on release date, always playing 6-7 year old games on my gamecube or psp. 

When I came here I wanted to work as hard as possible to get a good education and a good job. I managed to save some money for my first gaming pc which is an absolute monster (both in performance and size) but my real passion were the handhelds. That’s when I started collecting this newer handhelds and found my niche. Like you said, you can run almost EVERYTHING with a deck instead of buying all these but for me they’re a bit special. I’m now waiting for the ROG Ally to stop my collection for a while so I can focus on getting my Degree and continuing my education after that.",SteamDeck
jh9kq6e,"I have one of the Miyoo Minis - bottom right - and it's very nice having a portable that is actually pocketable. Though I think OP has the mini pro which is a smidge larger.

I tend to play Gameboy and SNES games on it though it can handle up through PS1. It's small enough to stick in your pocket which makes it a great travel companion. If you're clever with the RetroArch cores you use, you can even share saves and save states between it and the steam deck.",SteamDeck
jh9lypy,Try running RE4 remake on the steam deck then stop when you realize it looks worse than the original. Then try streaming it from your pc and stop because the stutters too much and is unenjoyable. Those other hand helps have more hp than the deck.,SteamDeck
jh9od9c,"Right now, I have a SD, OLED Switch, and Vita. I had my switch first of course. When I got the deck I really got into emulation but felt like with some of the PSP games, the emulation just felt off or not true to the original experience. Plus I don't want to always use the big ass SD for something light in performance. So I picked up the vita and have been using the vita for emulating everything PS1 and under. It's so pocketable and I'm having a good time playing some of the vita and PSP titles that I never got the chance to play when I was younger. Plus it feels great to play playstation games on Sony hardware.",SteamDeck
jh9z8vs,"I have a few handhelds myself, but usually there are some differences between them. 

I haven't done any emulation on my steam deck, so that's one of biggest differences. 

I didn't buy any of the windows handhelds that released, but I did buy a 2nd steam deck and made it a dedicated windows handheld when they were 10% off lol.",SteamDeck
jhayr3f,I'm agreeing with you on that every once in a while I'll see one of the smaller ones and go 🤔 sadly none of them are clamshells like the GBA SP or Nvidia Shield.,SteamDeck
jhbdceu,"Just to weigh in here, personally I have a deck, a switch lite and a hacked PS Vita, and they're all good at certain things. The deck is great for all the PC games, and I've used it for emulating certain things, home consoles like ps2 or snes, but something feels so wrong about playing gameboy games on a steam deck. It's too big and heavy. The vita is better suited to that type of emulation because its small and light, more akin to a gameboy or gameboy advance. Though when I started zelda a link to the past (the snes version) on the deck I was amazed at how good it looked, the colours and sharpness was great for how old the game is. I never had a snes or played many games from that time frame (I'm a 90's kid and grew up on the PS1 and PS2) but if you showed me that game without telling me what it was I wouldn't have said it was a snes game. I keep the switch around for Nintendo exclusives and waiting for the lite to be hackable",SteamDeck
jhbe6lh,It’s kind of like people having 4-5 cars isnt it? They are all similar yet different in their own way…,SteamDeck
jhbpy7v,"That was my first thought. Why settle for the rest when you have the best (and more so when the best is also the *cheapest*). But then again people would probably think I’m crazy for how many record players I have, or how many cars I *would* have if I had money, so if handheld PCs are someone’s thing then I can’t really argue with that.",SteamDeck

jh8tim2,"This is something I was super concerned about but being able to transfer games through steam without having to deal with download speeds from the device itself, using One Drive for important files, steam cloud saves and an external SSD are the solution for this. It’s like I’m using one device.",SteamDeck
jh9wz6n,"I basically won't play the same game on my desktop and Deck.  It's too annoying to wonder if the Steam Cloud is working or fucking it all up.

Not having that nailed down 100% is one of the two biggest gripes I have with the Deck (the other being the screen feeling like a cheap out compared to every other aspect of the hardware, just look at OP's photo, so much bezel and only mediocre colors, while the Deck beats all the other devices in controls, power, ergonomics, etc).

Last time I tried to play a game on Deck and PC, I lost all my saves.  Installed a game on PC that I was playing on Deck, and Steam took my empty save folder on PC and overwrote my 30hour save on the cloud...",SteamDeck
jha3vlz,Must be certain games. I started Webbed on my desktop Pc a while back. I downloaded it on deck because I thought it be cool and it continued the story mode.,SteamDeck
jh9a6md,"Don't know about OP, but in my case I originally only wanted a Switch for the portability and possibility to play some of my favourite games on the go. 

... Thing is, none of those games are Nintendo titles, and I personally have never really cared for Nintendo games or even liked them that much. So even though I almost got the Switch for myself a couple times, I eventually went back on my decision because of that, because it simply wasn't worth it to pay +300€ just to be able to play Witcher 3 and two more games on a train ride, especially when so many of my favorite games are not on the Switch either and the console itself is mostly geared toward gaming franchises that I simply do not care about.

Getting a Deck has completely replaced the need for me to ever get a Switch. Truthfully, the only Switch games I'd play ATM are Smash Bros and Mario Kart, which are precisely the games I bought my brother when we got him his Switch last Christmas. He's really into Nintendo games and he'd been wanting that console for a really long time. So it all worked out in the end.",SteamDeck
jh91swd,"Great question. Honestly my plan was to get the Aya neo line up but I soon realized that maybe it was better to have a more colorful collection with devices from different brands. After getting my Deck I scored the aya neo 2021 retro power and started from there. 

I know all of them have the same chipset and specs but for me is all about the design and different gimmicks. After having 3 6800u devices I decided to stop because even if they had different designs that was just a little too much. The last one I was going to get was the onexplayer 2 but as soon as they announced the ROG Ally I decided to wait and get that one instead. 

I’m not really into cloud gaming devices because as we all know they depend a lot on a good internet speed and I’m not really a fan on them really.

Thank you for the appreciation comment!!",SteamDeck
jh92gbj,Thank you so much. I would say that my daily driver is my Miyoo mini because of the size. It’s smaller than a Joycon and can play up to ps1 games.

jh92nfi,I mean the deck has a really special place for me. Steam os is extremely practical and simple to use after a while and being able to quickly go from days gone to vampire survivors is something out of this world but my Win 4 is very very close to the deck. Not only because I got it for the base price which was about 900$ but because it is very practical too. Easy to use and carry around and the small track pad or whatever it’s called works like a CHARM. It’s an awesome device!,SteamDeck

The skin I have on my deck is a Gundam skin that I bought from POP SKIN. I’ll send you his YouTube channel if you want to see his work. I reached out to him through reddit and sent him the money through paypal. Got my skin like 5 days after.  https://youtu.be/oAxpkWKo-Zs",SteamDeck

It is super portable and easy to carry around. It is an absolute powerhouse, I love the form factor and the backlit physical keyboard for easy access. I honestly feel like is the best one out of all the other 6800u’s handhelds. If you have the chance to get one of them don’t even think about. Pull the trigger on the Win 4!",SteamDeck

jhb3ov9,"Besides some gimmicks and different designs I dont think you’re necessarily missing out. They all perform better than the deck when using them with 15 watts or more but the battery drains faster when you use more than 20 watts. I would say that if you’re looking for an alternative option with windows to play unsupported games than you should wait for the ROG Ally to see how the prices are going to be. If that device is less than 1000$ you should give a try!

In my case I would only pick the GPD Win 4 over the deck because of how portable and powerful it is. Awesome physical keyboard  and the very cool psp like design.",SteamDeck
jh94p1v,I just noticed. It sounds awesome hahahhahah,SteamDeck
jhb41pw,"I’m going to be honest with you. None of them are going to replace your current setup. If you’re willing to sacrifice fps and a little bit of quality then I would suggest you to get the gpd win 4 or wait for the ROG Ally. 

The win 4 is very powerful, more than the Deck, comes with windows 11 and is super portable. On the other hand the rog ally is supposed to be a monster performance wise but we dont know the price yet. If your interested in a replacement I would consider the ROG ally if it’s under 1000$.",SteamDeck

jh9wdw6,"> I don't get how any one could prefer it, it just seems like a downside to not have your sticks, and dpad/buttons to be parallel.

Hahaha my history is kinda like yours, Dominican too, and I went through the same process like you, except I didn’t leave DR, I made a company here haha!

I only had 2 consoles, GameCube (I literally BEG for it) and a N64 (My lovely Godfather brought from the US)

Been working since I was 8-7 years in a mini market (colmado) with my dad (not by choice) I had to woke up at 3am every fucking day in order to be back home around 6:30, take a shower and go to school til 1pm… Then, work again at 6pm - 9pm. (Terrible childhood, got out at 18 and been working a lot for myself since then)

Besides the things that they’re meant to be providing me as a kid, I was never ever gifted something else… Just more work, everybody got a PSP (I didn’t) I got the GameCube by miracle. 

So, got a few builds in the office but mainly been using the Deck!

jhaslkq,"Cheers for sharing this. As a fellow Immigrant myself, I can closely relate to your experience. As a child I never had a proper gaming console. All I played on my AMD K6 pc was Neo Geo games because thats all it could run(besides OG resident evils). Fast forward to present day, after migrating to the US alone, finishing my Degree and making middle class salary, I am able to afford almost anything which I couldn’t as a child. Gaming being one of them. I now have each and every console that I wanted as a kid. My brothers always asks me, why do I still play old school games, while there are so many new AAA games in market. I wish one day I could make them understand the nostalgia factor is the main reason that makes these game’s amazing.

PS. The American Dream is still real. Anyone can make it as long as you put down the effort for it.",SteamDeck

Good luck for your degree! And don’t forget to share when you get the ROG",SteamDeck
jh9ehlu,7th gen APUs are what I am waiting on as well. If the Ally is as cheap as they are saying I will get one. I mean from my calcs we are looking at 5 to 6TF of performance on the ally at 35w and 2 at 15W. Far stronger than the deck. I never saw the point with the 6800u if I am honest feels more like a sidegrade than a true upgrade. Will keep the deck. Might get rid of my tower as once you go handheld you never go back imho,SteamDeck

SteamDeck for me is rediscovering the idea of being impressed some games run as well as they do and ranting about Tim Sweany hating Linux xD.",SteamDeck
jhbgmph,"Congratulations man you deserve it. The hard work pays off.

I hear you on the ROG Ally as well. I do like 80% of my gaming on the Deck these days and love AAA games, so if the price is right I will probably upgrade. 

With that said though, I hope they can provide a decent software experience because that is what really sets the Deck apart imo. I hate using Windows on a touchscreen. It just feels awful and makes it feel like a hacked together DIY project compared to SteamOS feeling like a polished console. 

I'm also bummed there's no touchpads on the Ally. Am I the only one who absolutely loves the touchpads on the Steam Deck? Once you get used to them, using the touchpads in unison with the gyro makes for an amazing FPS experience that joysticks just can't match. Yet no other manufacturers seem to value adding them to their competitors. 

So while the Ally looks awesome and I might buy one. If they released a Steam Deck Pro at the same time, it would be no contest on which one I'd buy. With that said though Asus has been making some amazing hardware in recent years. My Zephyrus G15 is a game changer of a gaming laptop. Plus they make those Microsoft Surface looking laptops where you use an external GPU over thunderbolt that are super cool.",SteamDeck

jhanc0c,"Agreed. I love my Switch, and I was able to have some great times playing BotW, D:OS2, etc. but once those are tapped then the rest of the games have very little appeal to me as I'm simply not in that demographic (no interest in overly family-friendly games, JRPGs, etc.).

The Deck is indeed the more capable device, that can run more demanding games. It’s also more ergonomic if you have adult hands.

But don’t disregard the portability of the Switch, which is much lighter and thinner (and smaller) than the SD. Lastly, to be able to play a quick multiplayer game of Mario Kart anywhere, without additional hardware, is killer.

Oh, and the Switch is also much quieter. I don’t think I ever heard the fans.

They can't protest either, because not working means, people are dying.

>Lots of people work hard and never get lucky.

No. Lots of people run in place. They never adapt or solution their situation. If you work really hard at a call center expect to stay a glorified phone clerk.",SteamDeck

jhb96mk,I remember really enjoying this game on PS3 and was disappointed it never continued on. Never played the expansion as I had finished the game and long moved on. I think it's $2 CDN currently on Steam so there's no going wrong with that choice.,SteamDeck
jhbpy0u,"Such an amazing game. The story, the visuals and characters are all brilliant.",SteamDeck
jhbqlc9,"Man, I'm seeing a lot of hate for this game here. This game had a particular rhythm and flow, and even combat (the small encounters) took 10 seconds max to finish if you know what you are doing.

&#x200B;

I've heard this game's flow mimics the original PoP, and I know a ton of the current fanbase started with the trilogy during the GC/PS2/XBox era.",SteamDeck
jhbd08q,"Shame the controls are so messed up, native controller support is there but the steam overlay, and by extension steamOS, conflict with it.",SteamDeck
jhbg38l,This game was a huge step backwards compared to the reboot trilogy. It sucks because a sequel to this had the potential to be awesome.,SteamDeck
jhbhjne,One of the first games I played on steamdeck. brought back memories.,SteamDeck
jhbxq20,"Pop 08 was pretty goated. People were upset that it was hard to lose or something I remember, but I never cared about that",SteamDeck
jhbqg2y,Hidden gem of a game right here,SteamDeck

jhbi4pi,The game looked incredible but the gameplay was so bad compared to the trilogy,SteamDeck
jhbeo9f,I didnt like this game the trilogy where way better.,SteamDeck
jhbgtn2,How are the PoP games on the deck btw? I got them a while back haven't touched them.,SteamDeck
jhbk7jd,Say *whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutt?*,SteamDeck
jhbncid,Reminds me I need to look for hitman,SteamDeck
jhbpfq6,This is one of those games that if it got true sequel it could have turned into something special. It really needed a second chance.,SteamDeck
jhbqyus,I thought I would hate this game after playing thr SOT trilogy but wow it was so good. I recently got it on sale for both Steam and Ubisoft. I should play it again.,SteamDeck

jhbsrhb,This type of thing is the absolute best purpose for this system!,SteamDeck
jhbt65s,Nice,SteamDeck
jhbtj4f,Sands of time is still my favourite just for both it’s cinematic presentation and gameplay.,SteamDeck
jhbtk1y,"Ohhhhh this looks like something I might want to do, replay alm of them!!",SteamDeck
jhbtuau,"One of the first games I booted up on SD. I totally get the sentiment that it was a disappointment after the SOT trilogy… but once you get past that it’s it’s own thing, and you just get into the flow of the rhythm based platforming and lightseed collection, it’s wonderful. I would have loved a direct sequel.",SteamDeck
jhbtxq6,I remember holding the first game so high that when this came out I was in happy. Then I beat the game like 5 times 🤣 I literally just watched the movie a few nights ago too. I had also named my old car Elika. My favorite car I ever had 01 is300,SteamDeck
jhbtzo8,"I was so excited for this game after Sands of Time, so I was so sad when it sucked.",SteamDeck
jhbu18u,"I still remember when I could not beat one of the bosses, because it had QTE scene of mashing space button, but for some reason my PC or keyboard made it insanely more difficult to complete that QTE.

Still very cool game, maybe worse, but the only PoP that I have fully finished.",SteamDeck

jhbvy9c,Nice! That game is beautiful but good lord the controls are a mess. I might give it another play sometime though.,SteamDeck

jhbymv8,"Maybe this game didn't have a great combat system but the cell shading implementation is still one of the best I've seen and holds up even today.

jhc1zgy,"Played it years ago on xbox 360, was fun but i couldn’t figure out what the hell is going on",SteamDeck
jhc2nbq,I am prince of persia fans. But playinh this game...i can't finish it. Feels like different game..,SteamDeck

jhc57p3,From what platform are you emulating?,SteamDeck

jhbz4es,"coming from the SoT trilogy, this was a major letdown",SteamDeck
jhbxvzf,"When you say ""The game's flow mimics the original PoP"" which original are we talking about?",SteamDeck
jhbuhom,"As already mentioned, emulating the original is probably a better experience.",SteamDeck
jhc2pw1,idk I loved that game. It felt so unique and different. Also loved the story. Spoiler: >!loved that it had the exact same ending The Last of Us would have years later!<.,SteamDeck
jhbiis5,"I remember this one was very repetitive, but the female companion and her interactions with the prince were amazing.",SteamDeck
jhbt0fm,"I don't like the steam editions. They weren't good ports for PC at the time and I don't think they work particularly well now, even with the controls.

I've been emulating the PS2 versions and those seem to work pretty well for me.",SteamDeck
jhbmghe,I've played the first of the trilogy and there's a bit of jank but plays well enough with some tinkering. The PC port isn't nearly as optimal and/or as seamless as you would hope for.,SteamDeck
jhc7zdv,Never finished it either. Felt weird.,SteamDeck
jhc6cco,It's a completely different game really. Would have been better to name it something else. I enjoyed it for what it was.,SteamDeck
jhc065l,I dont think they mean the 1989 original :d,SteamDeck
jhbq9vg,Repetitive?,SteamDeck
jhc6u32,"The 1989 PoP is firmly engrained in my mind from my childhood... So hard for me I never got close to passing the first level, still loved it",SteamDeck
jhbrsys,"I played it a really long time ago, but from my memory it felt like all the bosses were the same? Plus no time manipulation like in the trilogy.",SteamDeck
jhbts3n,"Yeah but the time mechanic started with the trilogy, not the series as a whole",SteamDeck
jhbd54r,I’m not terribly into the idea of bringing this massive contraption outside at all tbh.,SteamDeck
jhbea8i,"nobody cares bro, I just don't play in public cause it's quite hard to get into a game.",SteamDeck
jhbkh25,A guy stopped me in Panera bread today asking if that was the steam deck I was playing. We talked for about five minutes and he said he’s going home and ordering one.,SteamDeck
jhb5jvd,You shouldn't worry about the size. Size doesn't matter buddy.,SteamDeck
jhbe7qq,"More worried about getting robbed in public than playing, hence why I don’t take it out or only do so on plane trips",SteamDeck
jhbi79e,"Yeah, sometimes people get a little freaked out when I'm playing with it in public. I think it's the sheer size, or maybe the shape.

Regarding the Steam Deck, no issues so far using it in public.",SteamDeck
jhb81of,"Our daddy taught us not to be ashamed of our Decks, especially since they're such a good size and all.",SteamDeck
jhbbdgb,I wouldn’t play at a social setting like a bar because that’s kind of weird but I wouldn’t feel self-conscious at all if I am commuting on a bus or a train.,SteamDeck
jhbi3vo,"Honestly I feel like the main use of the deck is to play with it around your house, trips or if I know I have to wait for a long time. Carrying it to a bar doesn't sing right with me.",SteamDeck
jhb5wuq,"Nobody cares about you playing on your little Steam Deck, dude. Just whip it out and enjoy yourself.",SteamDeck
jhbc2rm,just play it in public man i play it on the bus to work all the time and whenever i can really. Its your life who cares what others think,SteamDeck
jhb5qc4,"Honestly I think you just gotta whip it out. I use my deck in class to take notes on but I was always so self-conscious about pulling it out because it's a pretty unorthodox design, however it's now normal for me to do so. Nobody ever commented on it...never taking it out on the bus just for a 20 minute commute.",SteamDeck
jhbb94f,Only if I'm worried about getting mugged. Cause that's a legitimate concern. But I keep even my phone in my pocket in those areas and don't find myself sitting around.,SteamDeck
jhb8zpg,Then there's me who looks for any occasion to play it in public,SteamDeck
jhbmzvn,It's a conversation starter. As a londoner I cannot be arsed to have a conversation with a stranger. Therefore it stays at home and I look at my phone like everyone else.,SteamDeck
jhbmxpy,"Why would one go to a bar, commonly known as a social scene, to play steam.",SteamDeck
jhblua1,Not worried about it at all lol. Idgaf what people think of me based off my own hobbies.,SteamDeck
jhb5lrj,"Not at all. Do it all the time. I am old, so people will pay even more attention to me playing LOL.",SteamDeck
jhbawaa,It's smaller than some the tablets I've seen kids playing on I think it's relatively normal in 2023,SteamDeck
jhbk21f,"As long as it isn't somewhere wildly inappropriate or a place you're likely to get robbed, you shouldn't give a fuck about how people perceive you doing something completely legal, non disruptive, and harmless. Sounds like a general anxiety/insecurity thing to me.",SteamDeck
jhbr49s,I don't mind nerding out at home but nerding out in public  is a nono for me.,SteamDeck
jhbrjnt,"My view is if you are out enjoying life gaming doesn’t fit for me. Like bar, beach, social events. But if I am transiting on a plane, waiting at the airport, on the train. I will proudly play .",SteamDeck
jhbvjtm,"hell no, i love that shit. then when people are like “is that a switch?” i tell them how it’s a SD and it’s better than the switch then i tell them they should buy one.",SteamDeck
jhc0s3a,"I just don’t get the point of playing it at a bar or any other place that’s social like that. I’d rather focus on hanging out with whoever I went with, listening to the band, or meeting people.

But bringing it along to pass time between classes or while on a trip, sure. 

In the end, who cares what other people think? Do whatever makes you happy.",SteamDeck
jhbi4nr,"Personally, I wouldn't play at a bar.  If I'm at a bar, I'm there for drinks.

However, I regularly bring my Deck with me to the laundromat and have plopped my fat ass right on the floor in front of one of the washers I'm using, and got my game on.  I also use it regularly at the office and sometimes at Starbucks when I'm there with my sib.",SteamDeck
jhbm619,I don't care I just don't want anyone bothering me about what I'm playing or asking to try it,SteamDeck
jhbnkma,"I totally get the whole ""feeling uncomfortable playing in public"" vibe. Feels like our insecurities holding our decks hostage outside of our ""safezone"". I've been trying to level up my confidence by hitting the gym and chowing down on protein like its on a Steam sale.

I've got this mental image of myself transforming from a basement-dwelling, sun-deprived gamer into a buff, sun-kissed demigod who just happens to love his deck...steam deck. I have this image of Thor picking up a Deck instead of Mjolnir. That's the vibe I'm going for and hopefully I'll finally be able to play with my deck on public then . 💪🎮😎 \*sight\*...Loooong way to go.",SteamDeck
jhbrrre,"I’m a 47 year old man. I don’t really like to whip my deck out in public.

Likely far less awkward than Hynnie Pop.",SteamDeck

jhbncs4,"To provide a different opinion, I have recently gotten very into emulation, and I’ve been playing through the old Pokémon games on my MIYOO mini. It’s great to play when you have a few minutes and it’s super small, about the size of a smartphone, or the original is about the size of a small wallet. It’s very compact and great for pockatability",SteamDeck
jhbo03r,"I don’t consider the steamdeck to be portable at all for public use imo. I tried using it on a train once, just didn’t like the experience. For any public use to pass the time I’d just take my ps vita, much much smaller, huge community, decent library of games/android ports.",SteamDeck

Oh and in a hospital casualty waiting room while waiting to be seen by a doctor, for over ten hours!!! An old couple actually asked me what it was and I explained it’s a handheld pc, they were very interested and asked where they could get one for their grandson for Christmas (this was in October I think) Nothing to be embarrassed about unless it’s cos you have social anxiety in the first place I guess.",SteamDeck

I've sat in parks with it a few times, brought it camping, and just generally giving my Deck its best life. I even used it as the voice box for a Halloween costume. And my desktop gets to keep its place as my home gaming machine.",SteamDeck
jhc09fg,I have actually thought about taking mine to my favorite local pub on more than a few occasions because it’s totally the kind of place that lots of people just come and work on a laptop or read a book over a pint but the main thing stopping me is just the fact that sticky bars and handheld computers do not mesh well.,SteamDeck
jhc0io9,"I would play it at a bar? No I’m there to socialize not sit alone. I play it while I travel all the time. On the plane, at the airport, anywhere at my hotel, on my lunch break at work if I’m visiting the home office, in vacation. It goes almost everywhere I do.",SteamDeck

I told the couple that it was no trouble if they needed to squeeze out on this longer flight. A meek nod. I whipped out my Steam Deck during the early proceedings. Apparently, it's shear girth imposed such a strong will on the aforementioned couple that they didn't move a wink the entire flight! I happily gamed at my leisure, enjoying the rogue-like wonders my SD held. Hell, even two drink coupons were used as I connected to the free plane wi-fi on my phone... at the same time!

Sometimes people come and ask me about my huge Deck I’m grabbing with both hands, I just tell them it’s a good time. 

At the end of the day, I’m just playing with my Deck, even when I’m gyrating the Deck so I can hit the bad guys in the face with my projectiles I don’t really notice any discomfort for anyone else around me until the screaming starts.

But if you’re a dude who’s working out of town, go to the bar, plug in your steam deck and chill and chat there’s never a problem with that. 
Just don’t be a guy who’s at a restraint drinking water and not tipping.

Anywhere else that’s not a good establishment I honestly can’t see why someone would have a problem with it.
Maybe if you’re at a football game and you’re playing FIFA on it? Haha",SteamDeck

jhbtgu7,"I know what you mean, I took it to Disneyland and while I was waiting for the train at the park to come to station, I definitely got a lotta looks but I mean I came to the understanding that it’s new for a lot of people.

jhbtkbt,"without a couple of exceptions, i've never been a ""playing in public""-guy, no matter the system (game gear, game boy, gba-sp, nds, 3ds, switch). for me it's all about the comfort of my couch. when i'm in a bar, i'd be too worried getting dirt on it or fatty fingerprints from peanuts. or it being stolen, while i'm in the bathroom.",SteamDeck
jhbtmvm,Yes but not because I'm self-conscious about using it. Subconsciously I want to brag about my new toy that most people don't have. But I refuse to bring it to public places I don't trust because I don't want to lose it or get it stolen.,SteamDeck

jhbuqz0,"I work in watch repair. Sometimes I deal with customers who come in waves and squads and never a steady stream. Sometimes I’m alone for an hour or 3-4 hours. 

Since younger folk who like watches are nerd like at times they see my steam deck and they just start asking questions since not many pop up in the wild and in public.

Star Wars squadron runs really well on it and it’s fun seeing Star Wars fans light up when they see it. Just today I had one person who was worried about the weight but felt the weight (when I had their expensive watch as collateral) and they are always shocked. I always have fun explaining how my game library is a decade plus old compared to newer consoles that typically are at the mercy of a narrow game library or waiting for backward compatible games or 4K rereleases. 



Just as a side note I also play solo player board games or read comic books or books which usually gets the customers attention and opens them for a quick convo.

I guess I treat the steam deck as a great boredom killer and great ice breaker.",SteamDeck
jhbusiw,"I’m only worried when I play some uh, nsfw games outside",SteamDeck

Joking aside, while I'm not uncomfortable, I'm very finicky about my electronics in general.  It's torture just putting my phone through the abuse it does at my work (blue-collar physical labor job) which has it constantly exposed to large amounts of heat and humidity which is another reason I'd be hesitant on bringing it with me, that and possibility of theft.

I don't find it weird to play in public because that's literally what it's for. Playing at a bar seems... Idk.. lame",SteamDeck
jhbx8lp,"There will be like 5 empty benches next to me, and of course, a guy comes up right next to me and sits down. Perv was even trying to sneak a peek at what I was holding. Apparently, he caught a glimpse and said, ""Wow, I really didn't expect it to be that big, looks really satisfying coming from that tiny white thing I've been on since a trip to Japan in 2012!"". I didn't respond, just kept playing my game. All the sudden I feel a tickle on my ear as he whispers, ""I'll let you hold mine if you let me hold yours."". I look over at him in horror as he whips it out... ""Ohhhh a White PS Vita. No I don't want to hold it."". He looked sad, stopped jerking off, and went on his way. So to answer your question, no, im super cumfy in pubelic playing with my big black deck!",SteamDeck

jhbycff,"I was using my Steam Deck in a public setting in my community, and people would not stop staring at me. At first, it seemed like general curiosity. But then it felt that people were scowling at me as they walked by. Sure enough, I started to hear whispers and murmering beneath their breath as they walked by. 

Finally, I had to ask my brother why people were so freaked out by someone using a handheld device to play video games simply because it's not on a Nintendo product. 

My brother simply shook his head and said, ""Robert ... we're Amish."" So now I play with my Deck under a blanket in the barn late at night, to hide my shame from God. 



(Btw, it's OK for me to make this joke because if an Amish person ever reads it they will be in more trouble than I will.)",SteamDeck
jhbye3w,"I bring my deck with when I pick my daughter up from school. She’s in middle school so I just park and she comes to me. Traffic is hit or miss so I end up with 20 mins to spare on a good day so I play while I wait in the car. I am very self conscious at times but I just throw on music of an audio book and embrace the weirdness that is me. Currently playing Lego The Hobbit while listening to The Hobbit 🤣. My bf is the same. If he is picking up our daughter, he brings his and does the same thing. We’re a bunch of bookworm, music loving-gamers over here. I haven’t tried to play too much else where but it does what I need it to do and I usually am heading home so I don’t worry about it being stolen so much. If I go into a store I put it in my purse.",SteamDeck
jhbyei8,"Honestly kinda feel like this but it all depends, I haven’t brought my deck out with me much in the 7 months I’ve owned it , I’ve got fears of it getting stolen, if I’m on a road trip and stop somewhere to eat or the airport then probably",SteamDeck
jhbyh1f,"I generally only take my deck out and about if I’ve got a long commute, or I sometimes take it to work (I work in a video game cafe and want to show my shiny new toy to customers lol).

jhbyw14,"I won't lie, I played it on a plane a few days ago and felt a little like an elitist douche bag..",SteamDeck
jhbyw57,"Yeah my PSP Go is the handheld that actually goes out in the wild with me.  Way more pocketable and works perfectly for waiting room gaming or waiting in line quick bursts.  The slider sleep function is almost perfect.

Steamdeck is more for allowing me to game at home and not be tethered to a certain room or chair.  I have a massive Big Joe bean bag in my living room and it's so wonderful to come home on my lunch break and just chill on there and game.  Also I'm getting older and having some issues with neck pain so sitting and staring at a TV causes alot of issues.   The Deck allows me to get in the most comfortable position and game out.  

The Deck to me is like having a hardbound book.  I prefer it but I wouldn't carry it around in public to read, I would bring a paperback.  That's the Deck for me, reading in bed, chilling on the couch while my wife finally gets a chance to watch her favorite shows when the kids go to bed.",SteamDeck

jhc0ft4,"Depends on the location. A big part of being in a bar is to socialize. So in that setting I wouldn't see myself bringing my Steam Deck. I'll occasionally bring mine with me, play during a commute, at an appointment, etc.

Also - you're overthinking it. Everyone is in their own heads worrying about what others think of them.",SteamDeck
jhc0iln,I wouldn’t,SteamDeck
jhc160u,"Hilariously enough, the few times I've taken the Steam Deck outside people have asked about it.

I think valve is shooting themselves in the foot by not having retail stores in the us, because most of the people I've talked to about it are interested but hesitant since they can't try it out unless they commit to dropping hundreds of dollars on it.",SteamDeck
jhc1cz2,I don't like playing my $700 Gameboy in public either but libraries are a good spot. So is my car with AC and Bluetooth surround sound. On idle I use a half of a gallon per hour. Considerably less than the cost of AC in my house.,SteamDeck
jhc1eoh,"I wouldn't judge anyone for gaming in public but I wouldn't be able to relax enough to do it myself. I have a switch lite as well and I've never used that in public either.

jhc296y,"I got asked by airport security and flight attendands about it, and if I could recommend it, or they told me they're a bit jealous haha. They were just genuinely curious.

So far, all people reacted positively to it :)",SteamDeck

jhc3l1j,"I would only play it on a plane or train. While traveling. If I’m out of doors I try to engage with what I’m doing be it food, scenery or sport. I play mostly in bed and I’m older though.

The same applies for books, I just can't zone out / enjoy the experience with people/noise around.",SteamDeck
jhc3zes,"I don’t even have the opportunity to play in public so that’s kind of a moot point. Though I wouldn’t be ashamed. It’s usually when I was able to (with other consoles like the switch), I never felt like it. When my commute included about 30/40min of train riding, that wasn’t ever nearly enough time to entice me to play. You barely start and have to stop again. Even whipping out a Gameboy or something, I just never feel the drive to progress in any game, and I don’t really play games you could maybe classify as „idle games“ (think tetris if you’re old school).    
   
Apart from that, there’s no situation when I would be in public with enough spare time. Maybe a really long train ride and probably wait times, but realistically I’m behind the wheel of a car anyways and I think it’s frowned upon if I play games while driving :‘D",SteamDeck
jhc4598,I'm scared of it being robbed or snatched if I play it in public.,SteamDeck
jhc4o10,"I carry mine in a JSAUX case strapped to my lunch cooler.

It makes those 'go here and wait for a phone call' assignments much more tolerable, and allows me to progress in my games.

I work in electric utilities, so downtime is unpredictable and can be lengthy. A power brick is useful if you don't want to leave the truck running, and bluetooth headphones mean you can play while your coworker sleeps. 

In the wild? In a crowded area? No thanks. Too many opportunities for somebody to try to steal it or go full Karen and snatch/destroy it for whatever reason.",SteamDeck
jhc500q,Only if I forget to turn any porn mods off.,SteamDeck
jhc502f,"No, not really. I take it to the doctor, took it to the library to kill time while my wife was taking a quilting class. I'll take it pretty much anywhere. It's still decently portable on my mind. Of course, I have a small backpack to carry the accessories in because the original case didn't hold anything but the power supply. 

I don't mind it, but then again I think it's just because I'm old enough that I don't really care what people think at this point. 😂",SteamDeck
jhc62ef,So ive used mine on flights but thats abt the extent of public for me. Im just not comfortable sitting in public gaming. To be fair i was the same with my switch and vita. Most public i got was work and flights/airport.,SteamDeck
jhc6g2g,I only use it in public when I’m on a plane etc,SteamDeck
jhc6h1o,I played my steam deck in a McDonald’s and I had this one guy who came up to me asking if it was a steam deck. Then he wanted to look at all my games and saw Shadow of Mordor and said that he’s put a ton of hours in it. It was fun just talking about the steam deck and games.,SteamDeck

Otherwise I'm always happy whipping out my big deck and let it air a while.",SteamDeck
jhbqc2i,"Wut. Personally, I just stash it in the case that it came with, the cord fits in comfortably in the recess. I semi-regularly play at both my local dive bar as well as a drafthouse, mostly just either getting in a couple of runs in something like Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain 2. 

I hardly consider it to be particularly bulky or unwieldy when it all fits into the case without issue.",SteamDeck

jhbr611,It's portable around the house though! Perfectly!,SteamDeck
jhbpmz8,"Same here, it's my favorite handheld by far but I can't just slip it into my pocket like I used to with the GBA or PSP. If I gotta carry around something to carry it, thats just too much hassle to pull out and kill time or something. I've got a pretty good phone that can handle any form of emulation available on Android or the most graphically intense mobile games at max settings, more than enough for anytime I'm away from home. 

Given it's not made of old school Nintendium, I'm not exactly looking to leave home with my fancy handheld PC anyway. Way less chance of it getting broken (or lost/stolen even) if it stays home. My GBA took a lot of falls as a kid and only has a small chunk missing out of it, I'm a lot more careful now but I'm willing to bet any modern handheld isn't surviving a single hard drop and I'm not taking that chance if I can avoid the possibility as not every drop is due to childish careleness after all.

Somewhere between low and mid range compared to what you can build currently with new hardware. I still know a lot of people with PCs vastly those specs though.",SteamDeck

now you just sound like a spoiled pc “master race” kid who has no idea what hardware most people use nowadays",SteamDeck
jh9yby2,Wdym potato both the ps5 and XSX sill have decent specs,SteamDeck
jha0vn2,PS5 actually has a good amount of  VRAM compared to current graphics cards. It's a bit of a sore spot right now because if you don't have a 3090 or 40 series card you will get worse than console performance,SteamDeck

jh9xvdc,"Not everything has to be hyper-realistic, but that's the direction the games industry is trying to go.",SteamDeck
jh9uoy9,IMO it’s still a matter of design and vision. Valheim is like 2gb but can still compete with bigger titles,SteamDeck
jh9ujx8,TIL Ark Survival Evolved is the most realistic game ever.,SteamDeck
jha84qy,"I dont think it's exactly that. In some ways, yes. If everything is supposed to be 4k, then the textures need to reflect that, and more detailed models mean more textures. Also, games have bigger play areas than they used to have. It's worse with cutscenes since the camera gets closer in... everything has to support that.

But, despite all that, I think the AAA developers also see ballooning drive sizes and dont care so much about the size of their game. In fact, I think they look at other games out there and compare... if XYZ is 150GB, then our game needs to be as well, or it seems like we dont have enough content in comparison.",SteamDeck
jh9wql5,"Not to mention the best quality graphics are always going to be uncompressed which always takes up a huge amount of space.  Though some things will have to be compressed otherwise you would have to buy at least at 2TB if not 4TB SSD for each game.  Which would mean having to use an external enclosure and a pci-e adapter/interface card, similar to the ones that let you use four or even eight graphics cards at once (basically the pci-e version of esata).",SteamDeck

jhax9ww,"Its not consistent but mostly 40-60 no problem. 40-45 indoor, 60 outsoor. Not sure why i get downvoted because there are benchmarks on youtube and pages of guides on how to do it, it takes some tinkering with config files and AMD’s ai upscaling. Downvoting me for being helpful is literally classic cancer reddit normie bull who can’t google anything. Buying a steamdeck literally means signing a deathwish of subpar linux experience where everything barely works. You have to use vine, protons and other bullshit to make stuff work. But when it works - its amazing. There are ways to overclock the deck too. So its your loss for not researching and using it to its full potential.",SteamDeck
jhams3y,That's true.. Är least to as far as you can compare them at all,SteamDeck
jhb2w0e,PS4 Pro would be more accurate.,SteamDeck
jhb9wgi,I believe FFXV did it. They had the 4k textures as a 100gb DLC.,SteamDeck
jhbhfe1,"World of Tanks has a SD and an HD client, the HD pack increases the install size by like 30%",SteamDeck
jhbrkr7,Diablo 4 beta had the option to remove the high res texture packs.,SteamDeck
jhb5bce,Yes absolutely. I've got a couple of games that are under 10 GB on my switch that are ~60gb on my deck. I would love to have the option of not downloading higher quality textures etc to save space where I need it.,SteamDeck
jhb82nx,"From what I understand, “4K textures” are kind of a misnomer. If you’re right up against a 1080p texture on a 720p screen you’re going to be able to notice it. “High-res” textures are a much better way to think about it, since where the texture is in the game makes a big difference",SteamDeck
jhbe9e4,"Sure, but right now games are being made for: Xbox One X/S, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Switch and in some cases mobile.

PS5 Sold 12 Million

Xbox Series X sold  like 17 million

The critical success of the Switch has sold over 100 Million.

Steam Deck recently passed 1 million and is on course to hit 3 million by 2024-25.

At BEST all linux users including Steam Deck is still less than 1% of 130 million

To be clear, I would love if Steam Deck users got optimized versions of games natively that were specifically tailored to work as best as possible out the box, but Proton itself is a godsend, we are already gaming like we have never gamed before.

Adding more development to an industry that just raised prices across the board would be horrifying just for one system that at best is only .5 % potential users in this generation of gaming.",SteamDeck

jhaqn1s,"70 hz screen overclock, lock at 35hz.",SteamDeck
jhagcuz,"Yeah I don’t know much at all about graphics, but its so weird that specs just keep jumping higher with games only looking slightly better. If they were using that power to somehow make games *feel* more realistic or improve the gameplay that would make sense to me, but they don’t - 99% of new games are either strategy games where graphics don’t really matter, or shooter/action games that play the same as they did 10 years ago but look slightly more polished.

And I get why AMD doesn’t have a problem with this, but they aren’t actually making the games, right?",SteamDeck

jh9y90j,"I definitely agree, I honestly prefer when they do something more unique with art direction. Hyper realism is a bit odd in gaming sometimes.",SteamDeck
jh9vfn9,"I agree about design as well. I don’t design games, as I’m a digital product designer but I have spent a great deal of my career focused on understanding quality design solutions that feel meaningful without having to be flashy or over the top. A lot of the big AAA games and companies spend so much time and money focused on creating games with peak visual quality only for the story to flat out suck and the world building to be non existent and lifeless. I’m a big fan of games that provide a deep and purposeful experience while using a clever art direction to offer something that’s visually appealing in more of an aesthetic way. I don’t need to see the uncanny pores and facial hair of an NPC with seven lines of dialogue.",SteamDeck
jh9ur2a,"Well, some Christians actually believe that Jesus and dinosaurs existed concurrently. So, there’s always that.",SteamDeck
jhbfxdf,So it’s 45 fps average not 60. If you say a game runs 60 it needs to average like 55 minimum to call it a smooth 60 even then that’s being generous. The reason it’s called “smooth 60” is because it’s basically always 60,SteamDeck
jhc2dr5,"The numbers I've found point towards a little less raw power (but years of technical advancements) compared to the base PS4. I'm really not sure how to compare the two because (if the numbers I've found are correct) the PS4's gpu can crank 1.8 tflop *and* devs can optimize for the specific hardware, while the Deck sits at 1.6 but is far more modern and it probably helps the cpu side is better too. I've ultimately decided to see it as ""the same"" as a PS4 and then it's up to the game to run well.",SteamDeck

jhbtpf0,"Ahh, my engagement 570 with its 1.3 gigs of vram. That monster was fantastic until ps4 Era of gaming hit",SteamDeck
jhaf2a5,And the used gamebryo engine was even outdated in 2011. That's because Fallout NV is technically Fallout 3 with an other story and additional textures.,SteamDeck
jha68lk,Imagine if there were kids at the GameStop with you back in the day angry that the game didn't have 4k textures,SteamDeck
jhauxbl,"Now look at PC, overhead from not having unified RAM/VRAM puts it at a disadvantage and doesn't have hardware accelerated decompression which has allowed the PS5 to run circles around it when it comes to loading high resolution textures in real-time.

So the company will either forced their game programmer to optimize their own work. usually done in like 3-6 months before launch. so that's barely enough time. And most of them are better at creating things (you are hired because you solve the business problem after all. It's all about solving them in any mean nessecary.) than testing and optimizing them.

How about Doom Eternal? I think a texture pool size of High/Ultra is the best I can get with the 6gb vram I get on the mobile gpu. The ultra nightmare with Rt on probably will need close to 8gb vram. So, doesn't PS5 just use a lower texture quality setting in this case?",SteamDeck

I'll summarise everything here and post links at the end. 

For my setup I have a 3D printed stand, Bluetooth keyboard and Xbox controller. To play WoW I just installed the console port addon (ill link a great tutorial video), I only tweaked the controls slightly and it works amazingly well. For those saying it doesn't look comfortable or just use a laptop.... The screen is big enough to play casually but if I need to see more I just dock it to my TV and play on the couch.... Or just play it handheld! So it's much more convenient than a laptop.

I also live in the UK, the weather here isn't usually this nice haha, and I have to admit the 3 different candle scents were maybe a bit much!

Keyboard - this isn't available but there's plenty similar ones out there:

jha5jqb,"Yea im thinking lint could be an issue too, as it finally started working again this morning... Not sure how long that'll last. Intermittent issues are the WORST to diagnose. But the two parts some are saying could be the timer (which I think we already replaced) or one of two internal thermostats. If im lucky its the little $10 fuse or just lint build up. It really doesn't help that insurance keeps going up. It's about 230 but is going up to 265 for... Reasons? We haven't hit anything... Haven't even used roadside assistance. Their excuse is that there have been more accidents in the area. Its Root insurance...

Another issue is our car situation. The one we're paying on is an 03 yukon denali because that's all we could get approved for. The commute car is down with a blown head gasket, 03 buick century. So now I'm going to work in something that gets 12mpg. It's hard finding an affordable car that can fit 3 full carseats and all the things needed for the kids (esp the baby). Thankfully the yukon will be paid off in another 11 months. The house in 4 years? Something like that.

Really wish I could just get something like a honda super cub for going to work lol.

Have considered selling the Steam Deck. It's a 512. Between that and whatever I get from selling the buick... Dunno. There's a dealership offering cash for clunkers if I can get it there... But that means yet another car payment",SteamDeck
jhaa79r,"Had to ditch my van back a couple years after having my head gaskets replaced (close to a grand) when I took it in to get the brakes checked and the mechanic pointed out the motor mount was rotted away and barely there. Ended up getting a used 2015 Nissan leaf for a steal considering it was when used prices were surpassing new. (Dealer has no idea what they were selling and I baited them hook line and sinker) My daily driver and it has been a dream not buying gas, oil changes, typical engine failure issues. Check like auto trader often might get a good deal from someone needing to cash out.

As for the dryer, most likely lint if it's in and oot. Easy fix is pull it away from the wall and remove the exhaust pipe. Take a vacuum (preferably with a hose) and suck out anything from the machines exhaust. If you have a lint trap cleaner, this is the best time to use it. Don't have one make one. Strip of bendy plastic, cut into the edges at an angle and pull the plastic forward. Done! As for parts, Google the make/model and you can likely find any parts for way cheaper than dealer. Bought the heater coils for mine for that 30$ I mentioned, never needed but holding into it in case. Wish you luck with this and the car bro. You sound like a good person, good things will come your way. At least I like to think that is still a thing and the evil bastards haven't won.

jhc02cz,CryoUtilities can move your shader cache to the drive the game is installed on ie your micro sd,SteamDeck
jhblxsa,This is why I couldn’t recommend the 64GB model for casual users. You can tell Valve put the 64GB model out there with compromises just to hit a price point. But unfortunately the people likely to buy this model are casual users.,SteamDeck
jhbrkg8,"the problem is probably the deck's built in shader precaching. basically valve fills up your ssd with giant shader downloads to get rid of stutter when compiling new shaders, but it fills up the 64gb model really quickly. 

if you have space on the sd card for it you can use cryoutilities to move your shader caches to the sd card (you should already have cryoutilities by now but if you dont its super simple to use)

if you dont have space on your sd card, delete the shader caches you have and disable shader precaching for the future. dxvk async eliminates stutter from manually compiling shaders pretty well, but this will still lead to some stuttering in demanding games",SteamDeck
jhbt3gt,"You look at the right place for the culprits. The shader cache and compat data folder contain sub folders of each game you installed. However, sometimes they are not deleted when deinstalling. The numbers are app ids, you can look them up on steamdb.info or if you use zshadercachekiller/cryoutilities/etc. they'll show you the game name. However the very long numbers are non-steam games. Only way to find out what they are is by snooping around in the compatdata folder and finding files with the game name. Delete compatdata folders with caution, they can contain save data but deleting shader cache should be without risk.

Edit: And when you checked that none of the folders are leftovers from installed games you can use zshadercachemover to move the cache to the sd card.",SteamDeck

Considering how Snoy bullied and pushed out JP devs with over a decade's history of working with them in order to pander to the international market (and has paid the price considering that Microsoft went for the jugular with the Activision Blizzard purchase, revealing how fragile they really were), not any more. They even rebuffed JP players by changing the controller layout to the international version.

Consider this, the Vita was Sony JP's project and it did gangbusters in Japan.

There is obviously some overlapping market which I believe is quite small.

In my opinion, it literally cannot fail. Even if only 10 units were ever sold those 10 units would still play the massive PC library and future titles. Steam and its library would still continue to work and flourish.

When choosing between buying indie titles on the Switch or the Deck the decision to me has been not which I think is better right now between the hardware but which I’ll be able to continue to play on a future machine, because I know the reality is I’ll buy titles that I won’t get around to playing for years.

Getting back to the OP’s original point, I doubt Nintendo are concerned about the Deck, let alone declaring war on it.

…are you serious? How are mods, backwards compatibility, and free multiplayer *not* perks? They’re very clearly reasons to choose pc over other platforms.

And no, they’re not historically specific to pc. In the past there have been consoles with backwards compatibility (current Xbox/PlayStation), free multiplayer (most consoles before 360 era, PS3, etc), and mods (very limited, but Skyrim on current gen consoles).

PC has had these throughout all the console generations but the point remains - these are reasons to get a pc just as they were reasons to get the consoles that shared these perks. 

For example, the PS3 had free multiplayer. This was a point to get it over the 360. But they still competed for the same demographic - free multiplayer didn’t magically give it an entirely separate user base.

>	One of the primary reasons that people give for choosing a console over PC is convenience

* Make sure your Rotation setting is dialed in for your trackpad ""as mouse""!!! Cannot be stressed enough; it rotates the tracking grid in software to line it up with the natural angle your thumb swipes along. This helps DRASTICALLY reduce unintentional vertical ""drift"" from the trackpad
* Set your trackpad as mouse sensitivity to be high. Most Steam Controller users like 180 degrees of camera rotation on a full horizontal swipe. I go even higher. Double that, in fact. 360/swipe. This is so its 180 on a half swipe either direction, which imo makes for better ""fast turning""/""target acquisition"".
* (optional, pending above) Reduce the Sensitivity Vertical Scale by some amount. Since most games lock the camera vertical rotation to some point (in fps' looking straight up to straight down is common), a good plan is for a full vertical swipe to take you from one limit to the other limit. Less (not making it all the way on a full swipe) is fine, hypothetically more (reaching from one limit to the other in less than a full swipe) is a waste. Also; reducing this slider will further help reduce vertical ""drift"" from the trackpad.
* (optional, if using trackball emulation) Set Friction Vertical Scale to 0. I cant recall if the new ui has the description, but if it does this slider actually behaves opposite to the description. 0 kills any vertical spin from the trackball emulation, which serves to eliminate any vertical ""drift"" from the emulated trackball.

Basically, you want the trackpad to be a ""fast turn""/""target acquisition"" input and then do your aiming with the gyro.

I havent played Amid Evil (yet), but this is how I play Ultrakill with the Steam Controller. Been working on getting P-Ranks on violent difficulty, and finding decent success.",SteamDeck
jh8pfgi,I personally don't like trackpad + gyro that much...I always use right stick and gyro...just put your thumb on it and gyro works great for me.  I get along really well with that.,SteamDeck
jh9bsox, Boomer Shooter?   Very disrespectful to the computer scientists who invented gaming for you children.,SteamDeck
jh98c6x,It's good for tiny changes.  Like setting up a sniper shot.,SteamDeck
jhacxoh,Anyone have a preference of Amid Evil vs Dusk?,SteamDeck
jhags8r,"Watching this makes me wonder if my trackpads are buggy or something.  I am absolutely, completely unable to get smooth movement like that no matter what settings I use.  For me it's pretty much always jittering around which makes precise aiming difficult.  

(and that's with the gyro turned off btw)",SteamDeck
jhbmbdx,You prefer trackpad only or trackpad+gyro?,SteamDeck
jhbyqy2,Never heard of this but it looks really fun,SteamDeck
jh9xp5s,"Yeah, gonna get Dusk as well!",SteamDeck
jh9x9ez,"Yes, it looks very mouse-like! Now that I think about it, I didn't like ttackpad-aiming at first either, maybe using it to play [2D shooters like Noita](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12h4pph/ditch_the_stick_why_trackpad_mouse_region_mode_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) helped me transition. It helps to re-bind Fire to your left hand as well, otherwise it will throw off your aiming thumb.",SteamDeck
jh9wg7h,"I had this experience with some games, it could be latency creeping in. When it happened with Deadlink, a simple restart fixed it. I heard using the Deck's framerate limiter can cause lag, and that it's better to use an in-game option if available. I'm pretty sure I had this issue with Black Mesa (don't remember, I'll have to retest).

Mixed input can also mess up in subtle ways, so you might have to go full keyboard/mouse bindings (restart the game after you do that). Hope you can solve those issues.",SteamDeck
jh9u7md,"Yeah, what's nice is whether you aim with a stick or pad, you can always use the other as a menu :) I remember not liking using the pad to aim when I first tried them as well. Maybe what helped me transition was using it in [""Mouse Region"" mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12h4pph/ditch_the_stick_why_trackpad_mouse_region_mode_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to aim in 2D shooters like Noita and Enter the Gungeon. Remapping Fire to left trigger also helps.",SteamDeck
jhaelvl,"Yeah, I think enabling gyro (with either stick or trackpad) is best for quick accuracy. However, some people can't use gyro due to disabilities, tremors, etc. so I just wanted to share how gyro-less trackpad is also a viable alternative that can actually work better than gyro-less stick. Especially without aim assist, which I think Amid Evil lacks (as there is no option for it).",SteamDeck
jhayllq,I wish that more games natively included flick stick.,SteamDeck
jh94gpe,"Fully agreed, I also used trackpads+gyro+backpedals almost exclusively during my playthrough of Amid Evil. Radial menu for weapon selection on trackpad was also essential for me.",SteamDeck
jh8qodf,"Yeah, stick cap-sense is cool, glad that works for you! This YouTuber [ZERO AIM](https://youtube.com/@zero_aim) uses sticks + gyro on Deck as well. Flick Stick is sweet too. That's what I love about the Deck, it gives enough options for everyone :)",SteamDeck
jh93e6b,"I find it interesting how different opinions are on this. Personally, I absolutely can't stand gyro *not* being on all the time. I use it so much also for just looking around, too, probably more often than the right stick in that case.

Either way, options are great!",SteamDeck
jh9vmhp,"Not sure if serious, but:
-  It's not a term I came up with.
- It might have originated as an insult, but I've only heard it used with connotations of endearment and pride, as a way to contrast the experience from modern AAA shooters with excessive guardrails and scripted sequences.
- Like ""roguelites"" it's become a genre in its own right.
- Many devs themselves have embraced the term. This game was part of a bundle literally called the [Boomer Shooter Bundle](https://www.pcgamer.com/humbles-boomer-shooter-bundle-is-one-of-the-best-fps-collections-ive-seen/)

(Really sad I missed that bundle, BTW.)",SteamDeck
jh9wohi,"Yeah, Boomers were the ones saying 1993 Doom was too violent for kids. They sure AF weren’t the ones playing these games.


Millennials had “ok Boomer” for about a week. Gen Z thought it was funny and wanted to say it too, even though they didn’t seem to know what a “boomer” actually was. Now an entire generation thinks a “boomer” is “anyone older than you.” It’s a travesty. Like if you came to the US from Europe and called Chinese people “crackers” and then a Chinese American person said “uh…no, you’re not using that word right” and then you said “no, you’re wrong. A cracker is an American of any color, you stupid cracker.”

PS yes, I understand that this is the accepted term now and that battle is lost. I’m still bitter though",SteamDeck
jh9dtct,"Not only that but very few boomers play video games, they where already +30 when these things emerged and they are 60+ now.",SteamDeck
jha5qop,What is disrespectful about that term?,SteamDeck
jhaneqx,"Hmm, could be, I have heard other inconsistencies with trackpads like haptics, though it's hard to isolate hardware/software/user.",SteamDeck
jhc69cp,"I have found that gyro feels really nice when you are using mouse input.

If you use joystick it seems to move in a horrible way for precision.",SteamDeck
jhbtwnf,"I still prefer trackpad+gyro for the highest accuracy, especially in cases where I have to simultaneously strafe-dodge and keep my crosshair locked on an enemy while shooting. But in circumstances where I might not have a choice, like riding in a bumping vehicle, trackpad-only works very effectively. I also wanted to share it for folks where gyro might not be an option; for example, some people have tremors or get easily motion-sick from it.",SteamDeck
jha22u9,Yeah I normally go full keyboard. I feel it's fine for movement with using outeredge bindings for sprint and walk,SteamDeck
jhadfkg,"Yesss, I'm not even considering another handheld until it can match all the inputs that the Deck can provide. This and ergonomics are just as important as raw specs, and the Deck is more than sufficient power-wise for the games I like to play on it, which is an ever-growing backlog anyway lol",SteamDeck
jh8spz4,Absolutely!!,SteamDeck
jha2hc3,"I remember the first time I saw ""boomer shooter"" I thought it was meant to be insulting, but then gave it a second thought and realised it would be absurd to think so many people are using this term to put down a genre of games lol.

Before this, we had ""old school shooter"" and ""Doom clone"", and ""boomer shooter"" to me just sounds like a funnier way of saying both. Maybe it's not accurate as people are pointing out, but neither was ""doom clone"", and as time goes on, neither would ""old school shooter"".",SteamDeck
jhac1pr,"Yup, it's just a catchy, convenient, tongue-in-cheek term. I forgot to mention the  subtle wordplay in ""boom,"" one of the key aspects of these games: lots of explosions and mayhem :)",SteamDeck
jhacc1s,"This post is the first time I've heard the term 'boomer shooter' too. Was going to ask what it meant. 

Just wondered if it was a new game type coming out,  like when every second game was a battle royale style.",SteamDeck

jhax91k,"One more far out opinion. Tex Murphy games (Dosbox) (Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directive). To play them on a purly gamepad focused device was impossible until now. :) Because their movement is mouse based for turn and forward and backward, but then you'd need to right click to stop moving, and at the same time you need extreme precision for menuing in dialog menues.

So after I started to set up analog controls with reverse outer zone for joysticks as mouse emulation, and the touchpad for precision mousing, and then put in an autofiring mouse rightclick once the stick reaches the inner zone (inverted outer zone), and then set auto fire interval to max, but then noticed, that the two rightclicks are stil too close together, because double rightclick kicks you out of walking mode, so then I hacked in an alternating command to the rightlclick of inverse outerzone, that does nothing, so I could stretch the autofire interval beyond the built in max --- and then it, just worked.

And then I finetuned delays, and it suddenly felt good. And then I wanted magnification for some ingame scenes, and mapped it to a backbutton within 10 seconds.

I've honestly been meaning to emulate Xbox Live Arcade games on my Steam Deck for a while, like Banjo Kazooie for example, but I haven't been able to figure out how to get any XBLA games to actually work on the system. I can run disk games on Xenia on the Deck just fine, but I haven't been able to figure out any ways to run XBLA games, mainly since the games that I have seem to be in an odd nameless file format. And running these same games works fine on my Windows PC, but not on the Steam Deck.

exfat or
ntfs or
ext4 as file systems on the usb stick.

(exfat preferably, as both MacOS and linux have no problems reading it.)

apfs = APPLE File System (ring a bell?)

Also, I would not do it that way. Because when MacOS copies files to external storage media it ads a bunch of metadata files (files with ._ in front of them) to the storage medium, that macos uses but that can not be stored on other file systems ""as part of the actual file"".

So now you run into the problem that when you tranfer them over, you actually have double the amounts of files, half of which are useless on a linux system.

I'd use samba or sftp for example:
https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#how-do-i-transfer-files-to-my-steam-deck - because when transfering using those, no additional metadata files get created by MacOS.

Or because I'm lazy, I use a windows virtual machine on MacOS (using parallels) (could also be a linux one), to copy files to external media, so I dont get those metadata files (._filename.txt).

There are also cleaners for those metadata files (some in script form, others simple Programs on MacOS), but that would be an extra step and I'm lazy.

It's mainly an issue of performance and battery for me. It can run all the things, but generally not as good, and for not as long. When a game can run on both Windows and SteamOS, running it on Windows is often the worse option.

If it's your only option for a game though, oh well. Windows it is.

> What’s the benefit of pitting people against Windows? Sounds like a L for everyone if you do that.

There's a lot to unpack with this question. But in short, Windows sucks, and in the places it shines best, Others are catching up.

Windows just isn't very valuable outside of some programs and ""Muh Games.""

Lets just say I helped 10.000s of people on the internet, on some projects longterm, I got nothing in return for it - and then I started to be a partly a dick about it.

Because I started to understand, that the people who were valuable to me in any sense - are not the people out there with a ""help me longterm"" attitude. :)

Its mostly the people that have stoped replying to low efforts posting entirely.

And thats in every field I entered. (Some without prior experience.)

So be nice to people who are new to a scene? Sure. I get the sentiment, and the concept behind it.

Always be on your best ""customer is always right and I should have been polite"" behavior, when you even would have to fake it?

No chance. In H-E-doublehockeysticks.

Low effort postings are a thing. Let me farm out ""project I want done"" to the internet is a thing. Abusive attitudes in people who always think, they can just request services, or quality answers without ever reaching the ability to giving anything back on their own - is a thing.

As in thats the normal outcome.

Because of one simple apect.

Social reciprocity breaks on the internet, because people dont know each other as small nit communities, so no one remembers the next persons face, or name and everyone just treats the next person in a ""free to exploit manner"".

So now enter online communities, set up to give you entirely made up point rankings, to give you dopain rushes, to do that stuff for free. Companies moving product support out to ""support communites"" using unpaid labor, and entire companies, that only build structures, for people to provide content in, and sells ads against it... Those business models exist. In practice and on paper (business plans).

And you might start to understand, why sometimes, I choose to be a dick...

Because what I'm handing out is not for sale. Its not a service a company or anyone could pay for. Because I do it for one motivation only and that is knowing that other people will learn stuff and then be able to teach others -- which btw. doesnt happen often, but for the few cases it does - doing so is worth it.

jhbsuov,"Actually no.

Its about sustained output. Of as many informed people as possible, over time.

So, you are correct, getting something in return on an individual level is something you can forget entirely, when dealing in those settings with the public at large. :)

What I'm describing as ""everyone is just out there to exploit the best person for their needs from their perspective"" is just normal behavior. I'm only mentioning it, because ""best person for their needs"" is not an unlimited resource, and allocation far more challenging than ""the universe will make it happen semi perfectly, there is karma"".

As in there is a point where quality of information usually plummets once information based communities leave their growing phase.

So there are two outcomes, either you see that the exploitation factor is high and you stop entirely. Or you ignore it for the benefit of people that might still learn and grow.

And then there is the position of someone looking and this starting to question how they could make the information flow better here, and coming to the conclusion, that if they reduce ""misuse"" (by scolding low effort questions, sometimes (overdoing is a problem)), they can keep the people actually willing to share higher quality information in the loop for longer, benefiting everyone.

Because to not see the exploitation, and the people burning out because of it, or just leaving, is simply not possible. You can ignore it. Or you can try to minimize it.

Also the tendency to overdo it is there - so what you do (balancing that) is valuable as well.

The point where I still have a conceptual problem is -- how do deal with information communities that jumped the shark entirely - so those that start to disseminate wrong information because the ""whats best"" and ""ego"" and ""most easy crowd"" took over. :)

There the right decision often is ""just leave them be"" - and I still find it very hard to do. As in I kind of cant. So when (personally perceived as) wrong recommendations get put out there, I still have the inclination to double my efforts.

Where you are right is, that if you want to elongate the growth phase of an information community - you'd do what you and every PR person in the world is promoting.

Just never pronounce anything to be anything other, than everyone is valuable to us, and we are friendly and welcoming, from whatever vantage point you want to shout it into the public.

Also ""spiraled"", and contemplated those aspects almost philosophically  are still two different things.

And actually, the more I think about it, the less I actually value the ""mass growth"" aspect of any information economy community concept.

Let the people grow who actually are interested and show promise. I'm not doing this for the lowest common denominator. (Youtuber popularity, or what someone can then put into a ""whats best way to"" posting, when reiterating part of it).

jhb3n6v,"Step 1: Install emudeck. Since you've got emudeck already, you're good here. Emudeck would've created a bunch of folders either on your internal drive or your SD card depending on what you selected when you installed it.

Step 2: Acquire your ROMs and PS3 bios files. Nobody here can tell you where to get these, because it's piracy.

Step 3: Once you have your bios files and roms, put your files in the relevant folders. For bios files that's emulation -> bios (you can just dump the bios files there loose, no need to put them in their own folder or anything). For roms that's emulation -> roms -> ps3.

Step 4: Run the emudeck installer again, select tools, select steam rom manager.

Step 5: Select preview up in the corner of SRM.

Step 6: Select parse down on the bottom of SRM.

Step 7: Select save. (You can also deselect roms/emulators you don't want added to steam before you hit save if you want.)

Step 8: Go back to gaming mode.

Step 9: Launch RPCS3.

Edit: Here's where it gets a little tricky. I wasn't aware of this since it's been awhile since I did PS3 emulation, I was getting thrown off by my much greater experience with PS2 emulation lol. 

Step 10. From within RPCS3, go to file -> install firmware, and navigate to the firmware file you downloaded (should be in a .pup format).

Step 11. Still from within RPCS3, go to file -> install packages/raps/edats. You'll want to use this function to install the rom's files. Should be a .pkg and a .rap file. 

Step 12. Now you should be able to play.",SteamDeck

jhaxp6l,Delete Proton files,SteamDeck
jhay528,"When switching proton compatibility layers, sometimes, but not always (its actually kind of rare) a compatdata folder can corrupt.

Compatdata folder = prefix folder (just another way of saying it)

What the compatdata folder is, is the fake windows install folder that gets created per game.

But because its the Fake windows install folder, the save files are also in there.

So find out how to backup your save files from there (cloud backup is one thing, but when you have hundreds of hours in a game you batter make sure you have them in your hands...). Then delete compatdata folder.

Then install again.

The thing for you to know is that sometimes switching proton versions will corrupt the fake windows install folder.

I'm not giving you folderpaths, because depending on what you used to install the game, they are different.

compatdata folder location is the search term for steam installs of the game

prefix folder location for lutris or heroic installs.

Also make sure that you have enabled ""show hidden files and folders in the linux file explorer"".

Also zshadercachekiller can nuke the compatdata folder, but first, make sure you got your saves.",SteamDeck

/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/THENNUMBEREDFOLDER (one compatfolder per game)

Game files folder:
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/THENNAMEDFOLDER


Game files folder can also be in a steamapps folder on you sdcard, if you installed the game on sdcard. Compatdata usually will always be in that place on the ssd, except if you used non official tools to move it.

/home/deck/

sometimes is /home/ only

so the way that that works is, that the folder path on the ssd is always /home/deck/

but if you click on home in the linux file explorer, you will be brought to home of the logged in user alredy, which is the user deck.

So you are in /home/deck/ already with no indication that you are.

Edit: big yes.

I installed it into an external hard drive on Windows, then connected the drive to my deck, booted into desktop mode, copied over the NOLF folder, added as a non steam game, forced proton GE, and it launched fine.

jh8c64l,"Maybe you clicked ""open"" in your browser when downloading the exe? Or you double clicked it after it finished downloading? It sounds like you might be trying to run the exe without adding it as a non steam game to Steam. There's a little work we need to do to get a Windows exe running under Linux.

In Steam (desktop mode) you want to click the Games menu then click Add a Non Steam Game to my library. Click Browse and find the installer exe, probably in your Downloads folder unless you picked somewhere else to put it.

The other thing you need to do for this step is  tell Steam to use Proton, which can translate some Windows-specific code to code SteamOS can use. Right click on your new shortcut (should be the name of the exe right now) and choose properties. Under Compatibility, click the drop down and choose Proton 8 (I think it's Proton 8.0-1 right now).

You can change the shortcut name from inside the Properties window (Step 4). Then follow step 5 either by downloading the controller template I provided or by choosing the base ""keyboard and mouse"" controller configuration (which you can then edit later). 

Once you've done all this you can run the installer by clicking the Steam Shortcut's play button (Step 6).",SteamDeck

jhaoyyi,"To be honest I don’t think you can.  Every time you add a new non-steam game it gets assigned a new autogenerated gameID number.  If steam can’t find an existing prefix with that ID it assumes it’s a new install and creates a new prefix for you.  I suppose in theory you could try renaming the old prefix folder to have the new gameID number, but I would kinda expect that would break things quite badly.

To ”fix” this, and to avoid similar issues for gog games in the future I would suggest ditching gog galaxy and using the heroic games launcher instead.  It’s an unofficial linux games launcher for the GOG/Epic games stores.  You can install it from the discover app in desktop mode.  You can then use another application called boilr ( also installable in discover ) to create shortcuts in steam for the gog game prefixes managed by heroic.  Because steam sees these as linux shortcuts (  eg// run com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl heroic://launch/123456 ) it does not try to create any new prefixes for them, so you can add/remove the shortcuts at will.

If you do decide to take this route, just make sure to backup any saves you may have before deleting the old prefix.",SteamDeck
jhay9cv,"Deleting the link is what killed it.

What you need to do is the following:

Take your installer, add it as a non steam game. Run it with some proton version. This will install the game.

Then you go to the ""non-steam game"" you added and change its target from the setup/installer exe to the game exe that you installed, via the 'properties' menu of the game in steam in desktop mode. You'll need protontricks to easily find the right prefix with the game exe, or you can do it manually.

This way it all stays in one prefix, nice and accessible.

I'm not 100% sure how well gog galaxy will work with this, but in theory you should do it the same way. Add galaxy installer as a non-steam game. Install it, then change the non-steam game's target from the galaxy installer to the galaxy exe.

Alternatively, you can use heroic or lutris to get gog games, or bottles to install gog galaxy.",SteamDeck
jhb9fk0,the launch parameter STEAM\_COMPAT\_DATA\_PATH fixes that. see other comment.,SteamDeck
jhb5oto,"Thank you :)

I got it running!

All in desktop mode:

A) Install GOG Galaxy

A.1) Download and add GoG Galaixe installer to steam and choose a recent proton version

A.2) Execute and Install GOG Galaixe & when done install your game

B) Add the games executable as game

B.1) Go to your games install location, select the exe and choose ""add to steam""

B.2) In steam, select your newly added game, goto options

B.3) go to Shortcut-LaunchOptions and enter:`STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=""/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/<game-app-id>"" %command%`

The game-app-id is generic and you need to find out your local one by looking into the parent directory of the path.

This option enables your link to be used within anothers proton directories (e.g. from the gog install)

B.4) Enable a recent proton version (""compatibility"")

C) Launch your game in gaming mode! Respect the Controler Settings as steam probably selects the wrong template and nothing works.

&#x200B;

It may be easier to download the standalone installer executable from GOG and use this one for installing. But i didnt do this yet.

A slight bump in CPU frequency seems to help a lot, however going much higher makes it use a lot more power and get very very hot.

I could also never get the CPU up to 4Ghz, I tried for Warzone in Windows and even with fanspeed at 100% and GPU usage super low and underclocked it would be pushing 100C as for some reason the CPU seems to heat up way more than the GPU, something to do with the chip layout I imagine!",SteamDeck

don't tell me you really think an SSD is faster than Ram. its not even comparable. pushing ram to the disk is MUCH slower and only meant to be used when your ram is limited which is not the case for the steam deck nor would it ever improve performance its just a crutch that sacrifices performance for pseudo ram. turning down swappiness is what improves performance because it GREATLY reduces the usage of the swap file to almost nothing",SteamDeck

* For streaming-heavy games evicting too much file backed pages might actually cause rising IO pressure depending on how the game is designed.
* LRU might be able to relieve some of the problems regarding to swapping out hot pages. It's not perfect but it's also not always ""we have to keep everything in memory"".

LMAO wrong. Swappiness decides how much anonymous pages (simply put: process memory) can be swapped out compare to file pages (opened files) when memory pressure rises, and the default is 50-50. There's also some algorithm in place to avoid hot pages so there's better chance that it would swap out pages that don't matter immediately to the game.

Keep in mind that stutters can still occur when the kernel tries harder to figure out what pages can be reclaimed when there's less viable candidates for it to work with, and that throw away hot file pages can sometimes cause problems too when e.g. the game streams heavily.",SteamDeck

I've also tested every vram setting and games will use the same amount of vram regardless of the setting and get the same performance. the issue starts when you start to starve the CPU as in the case of Red Dead Redemption 2 but otherwise the only difference is 256MB gives the system more ram to work with overall.",SteamDeck

This doesnt need to be 2 different services, it can be one and the same.

Not when the alternative is Piracy + No cloud saves at all.... I have the right to come with suggestions and I also have the right to complain as much as they have the right to host a subpar service, that only works sometimes.

Back to my original question: WHY is it up to the devs to implement and not just a standard for all games that Steam takes care of?

* Bluetooth device connections aren't in the right-hand sidebar overlay, which makes zero sense to me. I should *not* have to dive into device settings to connect my headphones when they don't auto-connect (Bluetooth Decky Loader plugin to the rescue for this one).
* The trigger buttons don't hard click like the Steam Controller.
* The virtual keyboard could definitely use a bit of work; it's almost certainly user error, but I always end up accidentally opening the accent overlay thing on keys when I try to capitalize a letter... it feels clunky enough that I frequently end up poking the keyboard onscreen instead of using the pads.
* Navigating the store on Deck is a *pain*; it's slow, the front store page frequently fails to entirely load or just wigs out, and I'm not a bit fan of the layout of individual game pages on the store on Deck

If you open konsole and paste and run this command:

```bash
du -h -d2 ~ | sort -h
```

It'll output a list of subdirectories that are taking up the most space. You can then replace `~` with the paths of the biggest hogs (_e.g._

```bash
du -h -d2 /home/deck/.var/app/ | sort -h
```

) to continue to drill down.

Of course, that will tell you _where_ the files are, not _what_ they are or how to remove them. But it should at least point you in the right direction.

#### Obligatory explainer 

It's a good rule that you should never paste and run (even non-privileged) commands on any device without understanding what they do, so:

- `du`: disk usage -- it's GNU's disk usage analyzer which reports the amount of space taken up by subdirectories along each given path. The cool thing is that it treats symlinks as files (instead of following them as folders) so you don't end up double- or triple-counting content that's available under multiple paths
- `-h`: make the output human-readible (52.3 GB instead of 54840524) 
- `-dN`: break down to _N_ levels of subdirectories (`-d0` would just tell you the disk usage of the path with no breakdown, FYI) 
- `~`: The UNIX shorthand for your home directly. Equivalent to `/home/deck` but way shorter to type. Provided here as the argument for where `du` is searching
- `|`: ""pipe"" the output from the first command as the input to the second command
- `sort`: what it says on the tin. Sorts the lines of a provided input
- `-h`: Allows `sort` to sort human-readible file sizes (so 12 KB isn't treated as larger than 9 GB)",SteamDeck

I just used my switch after a while yesterday. It sucks in comparison.",SteamDeck
jhbfxi3,[deleted],SteamDeck
jhbhkeg,"I loved these Hori pad when I had a switch.

But the general lag in the UI/shop of the switch pissed me off and made me sell it.

I'll take the steamdeck over it any days.",SteamDeck
jhbkibe,Valve did great job on this. A dedicated person can get an a awesome experience at a price that is reasonable considering the technology. Asus product release will be another interesting device. It will have a better fps and screen but worse battery life. The question will be which provides the best overall experience. Steam also has the store proton partner and Im guessing that Steam will kind of welcome Asus because of the Steam store. The best part of this for me is how many new Linux users there are.,SteamDeck
jhbmcw1,"Because of health issues, I started using the Switch last year. I really liked playing it in bed or anywhere place I could find physical comfort—sitting on the couch was not an option. The Hori Split Pad and 7” screen worked really well for me. When the Steam Deck was on sale a month ago, my Switch experience opened me up to consider it (I had been wanting to get back into the PC gaming world for a few years). It checked off a lot of boxes for me, and I bought it.

My Switch use has gone down dramatically since I’ve gotten the Deck (mostly due to Vampire Survivors). So, using time spent as the deciding factor, then I guess I favor the Steam Deck. But there will always be room for the Switch because of its first party games and exclusives. Before someone says it, I don’t care to emulate Switch games on the Deck.

My confidence in Valve’s moves to design an end to end user experience optimized for the Steam Deck has me super stoked about the future of the Steam Deck. In contrast, Sony with the Vita was satisfied with rolling out a nice piece of hardware but with games that were not optimized for handhelds. The super small text and game elements just killed the experience for me (older gamer). Simply scaling down visuals intended for a large screen does not work.",SteamDeck

If you're using the trackpads for camera movement, use the analog stick instead.

You'll then want to fiddle with your FOV until you're comfortable (start between 75° and 90° and adjust from there)

Also, favour performance. to Lower graphical settings until you're getting a steady 60. You may also want to enable VSync if you're experience any jitter/screen tearing. Hope this helps!

If you can monkey with the quality and get solid 60FPS?  Great.

If you can't get anything that *doesn't jump around a lot*, lock down the frame rate to something that will.  Most games have a ""max framerate"" slider in the graphics settings.  Set that to 30fps, for example.  Can the game hold that value?  That should help you.

You could dial that up until you find a **sustainable** framerate.",SteamDeck
jhba7bt,"It’s usually in the game’s graphical settings.

The higher the frame rate is better obviously, but if the game is choppy it can be disorienting to have it jump from 40 to 60 to back again, so if you lock it at 40 for example this won’t happen.

What I've done is use the Shotty plugin for Decky Loader.  This will take all your screen shots from the insane creepy file structure that Valve decided to use and magically move them all to the **Pictures** folder complete with real names for the folders, making it very easy to see/find them.

Setup Tutorial for all of the Dosbox based games:

You can read the setup tutorial for Pandora Directive here, all Dosbox based games (thats all of the games except for Overseer and Tesla Effect) are set up in the same way.:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12iqoeg/issues_with_dosbox_tex_murphy_series/

Setup Tutorial for Overseer:

Tex Murphy: Overseer (4W, FSR 2) 

Finally got it to run.. Minor nightmare.. 🙂 (ProtonDB lists this game as broken.) 
Used Lutris and this Wine version installed into Lutris with Protonup-qt (a fairly recent one with dxvk enabled, edit: lutris-GE-Proton7-43-x86_64). 

CD Version of the game, as the DVD version apparantly doesnt work.
In Lutris click on the plus, add custom game (last entry), Name the game, select the runner (wine), set win32 architecture for the prefix (important), enter the prefix location /home/deck/Games/tex-murphy-overseer  in wine options ticked activate dgvoodoo2 or similar, then ok.

The gag is,that the Game needs to be in a win32 prefix, which with lutris you can only set up at the prefix creation stage. And the default installer detects x64, which is wrong - and then the games installer errors out with win95 or higher error. But if you set win32 at the creation of the prefix (see above, needs to be a custom made one), it gets created in win32 architecture. 
Next, next to play in lutris there is this lollypop icon. Where you can access wine config. In wine config you can set the windows environment to Windows 98 (only available when the prefix was created as win32). then the installer will run. 
From that point forward I didnt run the installer straight away, but followed a cd to dvd tutorial for the game out there (aka nocd) to the T (the one that also tells you to install the 1.04 patch, even created the directories it told me and installed from there). whenever I needed to change the installer, I picked a new exe for the games launch path. In the end I copied over the patched .exe but not the games config .ini yet (nocd tutorial tells you to copy over that file as well, in the end I never did.). Ran the game, then compared the ini settings carefully one by one. (Turns out midi can be left turned on f.e.)

ingame settings double lines on videos, 800x600, and 800x600 windows size, everything in advanced graphics settings checked everything maxed out. 
Mouse cursor flickers. But it isnt a dealbreaker, as you can configure the game to use dual joystick style movement and only need the mouse to interact with things, so you can hide it in the bottom left, when you are not interacting with items, so its only a semi annoyance.

Also the cd to dvd patch works with the german language version of the game as well, although the subtitles then will be english. (Which I prefer. 🙂 ) 

Game crashes pretty frequently every 30 min or so in testing, but then remembers the position prior to crash on your last interaction and starts up very quickly, so I'd say playable. Also I'm not on the latest wine dxvk build, and cxbx also crashed with the one I'm using, so maybe its the wine build. 

edit: Restricting number of cores to 1 in Lutris settings for the game, or moving the installed games location to (fake windows c drive in /home/deck/Games/tex-murphy-overseer/) C:/Overseer/ and not C:/Program Files/Overseer/ (shorter path, no space) may have reduced or solved the frequent crashing issue. Still have to play more to confirm.

Re: PS: Hmm that's a good question. My personal recommendation would be Burnout 2 on the PS2 - or Burnout 3, if that's more your taste! 

Re: PPS: When I score each game in these videos, it's a compatibility rating - how well that port runs on Deck either via Proton or Emulation, so it doesn't have anything to do with the game's quality as a game. The review portion at the beginning of each section is more-so devoted to that. :)",SteamDeck

For starters, when using Proton, only change it if something breaks, or if a new version of proton has something specific to your game, like a fix. 

When something breaks, like an update, only then try a new version of Proton. It doesn't hurt to just change it first, and see if it fixes. If it doesn't, then try deleting the old Proton prefix, and try again.

Just be wary that some saves and configs are stored in the prefix, so don't delete until you know and then save those files. Use Pcgamingwiki to find out where the saves are.

>Internal storage on the 64gb model is about as fast as the sd card. 

The eMMC drive can read at about 400MB/s. The microSD is going to be limited to around 90MB/s. It still makes a difference.

>Shader cache is loaded to the RAM when the game loads, slow storage will only make your load time longer, it won't affect the perfomance.

Shaders are shifted in and out of RAM as needed. They do not necessarily persist there indefinitely. Therefore, drive read time still matters a lot.

>Valve do not recommend replacing the internal storage, they want you to use the sd card.

While true that Valve does not support user storage upgrades, they willingly showed everyone how to do it. You're just on you're own if you do.

1. Go to Desktop Mode. Open Steam from it and in the search bar, type in Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime. Make sure this is installed, sometimes it doesn't install correctly with EAC-based games and that causes issues like yours (phantom EAC, where it lets you in then boots.)

2. Delete your prefix for Halo MCC. A prefix is the little bottle your game's settings are stored in and sometimes they don't respond correctly to you adding EAC support. I know for Fall Guys, I had to wipe my prefix before it would recognize the added support. You just have to click start over the game, go to Developer and Delete Proton Files. If this isn't present, go to System Settings and Enable Developer mode.

3. Now, in game properties,go to Compatibility and force the user of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool. Make sure you're using the LATEST Proton-GE.

Not very into mobile games in general, and I wouldn’t really bother to play it on my laptop.

But it runs fantastic, and with some custom button assignments it plays much better. As well as having the trackpads available for quick UI nav, or clicking on items in game helps a lot.

*The default assignments for select, back, primary skill etc are weird because they are just mapped in order based on how the mobile controls were. It’s very awkward unless you change them around.*

I had heard a lot of negativity surrounding it, but it’s actually a decent game. If you aren’t terribly susceptible to suggestion and able to resist clicking on every internet ad you see, or rage at what’s in someone else’s grocery cart… it’s fairly easy to straight up ignore the existence of the Mtx/P2W in the game and just enjoy it within the bounds of freeness.

Luckily for you, I have a draft of a post I was going to make on how to set up reshade on the deck. It's very detailed.



#[1. ReShade Linux](https://github.com/kevinlekiller/reshade-steam-proton) 
[   Detailed Usage Guide](https://github.com/kevinlekiller/reshade-steam-proton/blob/main/reshade-linux.sh#L21) **(check this to see which types of games this won't work with)**

Probably my #1 recommendation that I have for all steam deck users, is this. Even if you're not a person who likes to fiddle with how the lighting looks in a game (that's what ReShade lets you do, if you didn't know), there is a pair of filters that give a huge clarity boost to the Deck's screen. First, I'll go through how to set all this up so you can use ReShade and that clarity boost in most of your games.


Open up the Konsole, and download the .sh file you'll need by typing this:

    curl -LO https://github.com/kevinlekiller/reshade-steam-proton/raw/main/reshade-linux.sh

The .sh files it'll give you from this are located in /home/deck/reshade-steam-proton/, and as weird as it sounds, you'll be using reshade-linux.sh, NOT reshade-steam-proton.sh. For the next step, you'll want to make the script an executable by going back to the Konsole and typing 

    chmod u+x reshade-linux.sh

Now, you can drag that .sh file to anywhere you want and click ""Link Here"" to make an easy shortcut. To actually launch it, clicking it wont work, you have to right click it and click ""Run in Konsole"". Follow all of the on-screen instructions, I suggest doing all of the steps manually, in the script. To get the information on whether your game is 32 or 64 bits, and what dll you need to use, check out PCGamingWiki. **Make sure you read the instructions at the end when it's done! It will give you a launch command that you need to paste into the game's launch commands.** To access ReShade in game, map the Home button to something like the back buttons, and map a trackpad as a mouse+left click as click. Once you're certain your ReShade setup looks nice, ***tick the ""Performance Mode"" box at the bottom***, then you can rebind that back button and trackpad back to whatever you want.


Now that that's all out of the way, I cannot recommend enough 2 different shaders for pretty much every realistic looking 3D game: ***ContrastAdaptiveSharpen (CAS.fx) for handheld gameplay, and DELC_Sharpen (qUINT_sharp.fx) for docked gameplay***. CAS adds too much grain for docked gameplay when combined with the 720p-1080p FSR I'll get to later, but looks fantastic in handheld and gives clarity I didn't think the Deck screen could provide. Both of these shaders will make the game look less blurry, I noticed an extremely stark difference in a game like Resident Evil 2 Remake in handheld mode. Some other shaders I've found to look nice when you combine them, are BloomingHDR.fx (I recommend tweaking this one), PD80_03_Filmic_Adaptation.fx, Technicolor2.fx, Sepia.fx, as well as LumaSharpen.fx+FilmicAnamorphicSharpen.fx for more 2D/cell shaded games.",SteamDeck

1. Open Desktop Mode

You may still be able to get better performance by tweaking the settings via the config.

>Is there a way to apply the config to the native Linux version?

According to the wiki, it should be in .local/share/SatelliteReign/

You'll have to do the same thing as above in showing hidden files in Dolphin to see if it's in that folder. Anything that starts with a . is a hidden file.

Otherwise, you can look in the .steam/steamapps/compatdata/268870/ or .steam/steamapps/common/SatelliteReign/

Opting for the Switch versions over the PC versions is a great choice for me, because:

* Classic font (this is not a big deal, as you can mod in a great-looking classic font on PC)
* Toggle random encounters on/off - this is such a godsend, particularly for the games I've already played before. Love them but it often feels like at least 30-60 minutes of most dungeons end up being sort of tedious battling of standard monsters. You can't get too comfortable though because if you skip all random encounters the bosses will cream you, so use judiciously.
* Experience points 2x (or more, if needed) to eliminate grinding where necessary. Currently doing this with Final Fantasy IV and yeah, this game is pretty hard without grinding even just a few hours in. I don't have that kind of time anymore.
* Battle speed ""very fast"" and battle message speed ""very fast"" turns Active Time battles in Final Fantasy IV into harried, intense skirmishes, almost arcade-like. No time to waste, act quick or end up with dead party members! It's still early-goings for me but this brings a whole new hardcore feel to the game, I think.",SteamDeck

---

A small disclaimer: I'm using analogies to explain how flash memory cells work. I tried my best to be as accurate as possible while also making it possible to understand what's going on, but the technicalities will probably be lost or jumbled up in the process.

To get in the nitty gritty now: NAND memory is a really fancy and complicated way of jamming electricity (electrons) inside a cage (between two insulators) and reading it back. So, say the cage is mostly full, that's read as a `1`, while if it were empty or close to empty, that's a `0`. With higher-density NAND cells, we can take it a step further and check *how full* the cage is.

For MLC (multi-level cell), we can translate the fullness of the cage to two bits:

- Full: `11`
- Half: `10`
- Empty: `00`

For TLC (triple-level cell), we add another bit and can represent a range from `111` to `000`:

- Full: `111`
- 6/7: `110`
- 5/7: `101`
- 4/7: `100`
- 3/7: `011`
- 2/7: `010`
- 1/7: `001`
- Empty: `000`

And so forth with 2^4 levels and 2^5 levels for QLC (quad-level) and PLC (penta-level), respectively. This is great for storing more data in the same physical space, but it also means that it gets exponentially harder to distinguish between two different levels. For example, if the cage is 25% full, is that closer to half, or closer to empty? If we meant to save the cage as half full, but it saved at 24% and was read as empty, that's called *a bit error*.

But hey, computers don't make mistakes so it would never fill it to 25% when it was supposed to fill it to 50%... right? Well, not quite. Physical damage of the insulation layer throws a wrench into that nice, idealistic thought. Let me explain:

Suppose you want to empty a cage and go from full (or half, or whatever) to empty. If it were a regular cage, you could just open the door and let some electricity escape, right? Unfortunately, electricity is more like pressurized water; it naturally tries *very* hard to escape on its own. With that in mind, let's change the analogy up a bit:

The ""cage"" is actually a watertight box with a pressure valve. When we let water in, we change the pressure so the inside of the box has a lower pressure than the outside, allowing water to come in. And when we want to let the water out, we put more pressure inside the box so it pushes water out.

In flash memory cells, this is done by sending high voltage pulses to change the ""pressure"" in a way that makes the electricity ""tunnel"" through the insulator (the pressure valve). This process of filling and emptying the cell (i.e. writing to it) permanently damages the insulator, leading to that problem I described earlier.

---

So, now that you understand how flash memory works, you're probably wondering why SSDs are fine, but SD Cards aren't. The gist of it is that SSDs are far more likely to employ techniques to mitigate both how often the cells are damaged, as well as how that damage affects their functionality.

**Wear Leveling:** Suppose you have some part of the hard drive you're constantly writing to (swap file, maybe?). Those cells would be damaged more frequently compared to the other cells. SSDs mitigate this by shuffling around the physical location of logical blocks so all cells get worn down evenly. In simple terms, it keeps moving that swap file's physical location around while telling the computer that ""yep, it's still in this place you put it.""

**Error Correction:** Using the magic of software, the SSD can read back the cells that were written and check for discrepancies. If it doesn't match what was supposed to be written, the block of cells gets marked as bad, and the SSD tries to write the data to a different block instead.

**Overprovisioning:** Often, SSD manufacturers will actually add an extra 20% worth of capacity to an SSD. These blocks are only accessible to the SSD controller itself, and they're used as extra space for wear leveling and replacing bad blocks. It's basically giving up (invisible) capacity for in exchange for a longer lifespan, which is often more important anyways.

**Using lower-density cells:** For a tiny device like a MicroSD Card, you pretty much need the highest density cells available to fit that much data within a small form factor. SSDs have the luxury of space, though, which allows them to use more-durable TLC or MLC cells.

jhboij6,"> Avoid anything critical on an SD card period anywhere.

Agreed.

> Nvme ssd is fine.

Ehhhh.

It all comes down to the manufacturer's reputability and the parts used. Cheap NVMe SSDs can still be made with low-durability PLC cells, shitty controllers, or no overprovisioning. And contrary, a decent-quality (I.e. not a ""backup"") portable SSD or SATA SSD can have a pretty good lifespan.

Always do your research. Brand reputation (are they well-established and known for quality SSDs?), pricing (is it too good to be true?), and manufacturer warranties (1 year? 5 years? 25?) are important considerations.

Also, don't buy SSDs from Wish, AliExpress, or (probably) Amazon. With the former two, you get what you pay for (or less). With Amazon, you either buy a fake, or you get shipped a fake because of SKU binning with third-party sellers.",SteamDeck

There are several wear leveling mechanisms that provide varying levels of longevity enhancement in such memory systems. The term preemptive wear leveling (PWL) has been used by Western Digital to describe their preservation technique used on hard disk drives (HDDs) designed for storing audio and video data.

Yep! With the measures put in place to prolong their lifespan, it's more likely the SSD controller dies before all the blocks of cells do.

> (nonsteam playtimes will be show on steams Homescreen/Gamescreen, steam times that are edited will only be shown in detailed view in the plugin itself, because steam stores the playtime of original steam games online / I recommend only editing nonsteam times :OKAY: )
> 
> 1. Start every game you want to edit times at least once (i know it's tedious, but much easier this way imo) (you probably don't need to do that, if you migrated)
> 2. Download DB Browser for sqlite from the discover store
> 3. maybe first make a copy of storage.db in ~/homebrew/data/SDH-Playtime (if something goes wrong, you'll still have the original file)
> 4. Open the storage.db with the db browser
> 5. click browse data in the upper left
> 6. make sure every game (ID + game name) is listed in the table game_dict
> 7. Make a note of the game ID you want to edit
> 8. change table to overall_time
> 9. find your game id and edit the duration (it's in seconds / you'll maybe see a huge number with a dot and more numbers, but just seconds is enough for example 3h = 10800, no need for a dot, if you edit)
> 10. do it for every game you want to edit

> 12. close db browser

There are three types of units: ordinary units which can be recruited between missions at relatively low cost, unique mercenary units, and the special commander units you get going through the story.

Every unit has a leadership stat, and any unit can be appointed as a commander of a squad (important story units are automatically commanders). High leadership stat = more units in the squad. Squads can be equipped with items, some of which increase leadership. I remember spending a LOT of time swapping items between squads to maximise the total number of units I could take on the field.

Also there is no in-level recruitment of generic units in *Symphony of War*. You have to set your squads up before the mission. I think you could retreat injured squads by swapping them for another squad in your army but you couldn't recruit new squads during a mission like in *Advance Wars*, whereas you can do exactly that in *Wargroove*.",SteamDeck

Some of the games that got me into using the deck for gaming were Fallout 4 (a game I already liked a lot, that runs very well with little effort on the deck). Fallout 4 also works offline, unlike MANY AAA RPG games (Looking at you, RDR2).

And some indie titles also got me playing it a lot - three big indie titles I played over the last year:

1. Clone Drone in the Danger Zone - this is kind of a third-person arena robot fighting game, it's really quite a lot of fun and exciting. Multiplayer is less exciting to me.
2. Vampire Survivors - Really needs no introduction
3. Deep Rock Galactic - Co-Op mining sci-fi shooter, my favorite game of all time.

20c cooler then without the external fan. 

With the thermal pad mod I would assume it’s in a safe range.

without overclocks I had a peak temp of 75c on the ic chip, charging below20% battery. IC chip is rated for 105c",SteamDeck
jh916h6,You do know it has both the jsaux BP and the thermal pad mod. It’s safer then it’s ever been,SteamDeck
jh91ujn,"Those are great mods, but kinda irrelevant here because cutting a hole directly above the fan alters the path of airflow. It is designed to have the air come in the holes at the left corner of the backplate and flow through the thermal module and the mobo components before reaching the fan. If you bypass this, the air will come directly to the fan and out of the top. 
Some components rely on airflow despite the thermal pad mods. There's a GN video about this topic. They also noted that lower APU temps aren't always good with the factory fan curve, since the lower rpm fan mode also limits the airflow over the mobo.",SteamDeck
jh92d1m,"I saw that video, but did you know that test was taken with the Backplate on and off.

Backplate is on with this Mod, I’ve tested without the jsaux backplate and still got a max temp of 75c on the IC and VRM. It’s rated for 105c 

My testing shows temps are well within safe temps with or without the thermal pad mod.

Do more research then just watching one video on YouTube. 

Maybe test it yourself or maybe do you just prefer to talking about things you know nothing about.",SteamDeck

jha8hs0,"Thanks for posting this issue, I was struggling with this for over a week before spending a day to fix it. Sad to see the issue is quite widespread. 

I tried a bunch of things to fix it: 
>- Disabling/uninstalling TunnelDeck plugin for deckyloader (it was allowing me to use OpenVPN)
>- Unchecking ""Enable Wifi Power Management"" under developer options.
>- Disabling IPv6 under network manager settings for this wifi connection.
>- Logging into my router's settings and setting the 5Ghz frequency to use channel 36. That last point seemed to stop the issue of booting up the deck and it refusing to accept the saved wifi password.
>- Ensuring the 5Ghz wifi frequency bandwidth is set to: 20/40/80Mhz rather than 20/40/80/160. 160Mhz can put 5Ghz wifi into the DFS range where military/plane/radio signals are needed. That can cause your 5Ghz wifi to be disabled or changed channels temporarily if those frequencies are detected. That was also the motivation for moving down to channel 36 too.
>- If your home network has multiple access points, make sure the main router /modem isn't fighting the other access points. At my mum's place she had separate access points both sending out 5Ghz wifi under the same SSID name. Normally that could be fine but in this case, each access point had their DHCP server enabled and both were serving a different IP range. I believe my deck would connect to what it thought was the same access point but be offered a different IP from what it expected, leading to the connection being rejected. Disabling the duplicate DHCP server should resolve the issue. Though in her case I just removed the extra access point as it was no longer needed with the equipment installed by her new ISP.",SteamDeck
jh7ukxn,"I've setup hundreds of devices and dhcp has never failed for me, as part of my degree I had to learn how to assign ip addresses manually but luckily I've never had to use it. In this specific case I agree that assigning a static ip will fix the issue but it's not the reason it's failing. Ipv6 is still not supported by a lot of things and is relatively new. I believe turning off ipv6 and forcing it to use ipv4 should fix the issue especially since wifi connectivity via steam os should not have a bunch of edge cases that would cause dhcp to fail, especially since it's developed by a billion dollar company.",SteamDeck

You will have to install the `wine` and `winetricks` packages. You have to enable the steam deck to install packages as it is not enabled by default from what I have heard. When you figure out how to install the `wine` and `winetricks` packages, proceed.

1. Go to [this page](https://www.h2maps.net/Cartographer/Installer/), and download the `h2pc_installer_2.1.zip` file near the bottom of the list. Extract this somewhere.
2. Open a terminal in the folder you extracted the zip file into. There should be a .bin and a .exe file in this folder. Type in `wine h2pc_setup_2.1.exe` and press enter. The project cartographer setup program should pop up.
3. Install project cartographer.
4. Once it is done installing, type in `winetricks -q d3dx9 mfc40 mfc42 vcrun2013`  into the terminal. This will install some windows dll's the game needs to run. This may take a while but is automatic so you can just let it do it's thing.
5. Once the above is finished, type in `winetricks --force wmp9` and press enter. We did not include this in the above command because halo 2 wants windows media player installed in order for sound to work. Windows media player 9 does not work in modern wine, but we want to install it anyway because it includes the codecs needed for game sound to work. This will finish and it may say something about windows media player failed to install, this is fine and doesnt matter, sound will now work in the game regardless.
6. Finally, to fix the ""failed to get compatibility info"" issue, just type in `winetricks win7` and hit enter.

You should now have an install of Halo 2 Project Cartographer with working sound. In order to launch the game, open a file manager, press ctrl+h to show hidden files, and navigate to the `.wine/drive_c/Games/Halo 2 Project Cartographer` folder. Right click and open a terminal here and type `wine halo2.exe`. The game should now launch. The window saying ""Halo 2 for Windows Vista has compatibility issues"" will pop up, just click the check box marked ""dont show again"" and hit run. Have fun.",SteamDeck

jhaf75s,"To preface this I don't own a steam deck or any other handheld PC and I'm multiplatform gamer. I have no horse in this race.

When comes to choosing either steam deck or rog ally I think you're gonna find that most people in this sub are gonna tell you get the steam deck (big surprise.) But there's a few things to consider such as which is more important to you such as pricing or performance.

 No one else will be able to come close to valves price to performance with the steam deck, unless someone like Microsoft where to make a similar device. 

If performance is what you care most about then the rog ally will be the one you want because it's gonna be able to hit higher frames then the deck even if it's not actually twice as fast.

I think the best thing to do is wait till the ally releases then you can decide which to get, which is what I'll be doing.",SteamDeck
jha62y6,Buy new handheld the day the Deck stops playing your favorite games on Steam.,SteamDeck

i don't have my touchscreen working though... which is weird, as it works in debian

might try recompiling with one of the posted kernel configs",SteamDeck

jh82pml,It was that lol thanks,SteamDeck
jh78g9i,Yes it runs fantastic at 60 fps and everything set to high. Only down sides is It's only getting about 2 hrs of battery. You get a lot more with it set to 30 and it still looks good,SteamDeck

but I guess you will need to do this via the Konsole terminal app

you will need to either go to the folder where the file is via: cd /FOLDERNAME or you can specify it in the command

to make it read only

chmod 444 Fallout4Prefs.ini

of if you only open Konsole and not change to the directory the file is in you will need to specify the full path to the file   


chmod 444 /PATHtoFILE/Fallout4Prefs.ini

to make it writable again then you can use 666

if sudo is required to change permissions then you just prefix the command with sudo  (sudo elevates your permissions which is required for certain commands)

jh76hr9,Does that drive a monitor?,SteamDeck
jh741fw,"Soon as they do support it Officially I'm going for it.

I'm tired of fighting to figure out if games run or not, 

some devs are stubborn won't tell you if they do half the time. 

Plus some devs are just against Linux, 

it's not gonna change, Accept it you want to play everything you NEED windows on the deck, don't like it fine, then stay waiting & hoping the game u can't run will get support, I'd rather have the choice & peace of mind.

Stuff is built with windows in mind, not Linux, Mods, patchers, etc making Linux a frustrating mess to deal with.

Steam deck is amazing but Linux is terrible to me, also do to the Linux steam deck, I've had to refund games cause it they don't work, I'm not rich I'm not gonna keep a game that doesn't work, theres other games I can buy.

I will refund every game that doesn't work.

if I had windows officially then if a game didn't run in steam Linux I could dual boot to windows & run the game there without needing to refund.",SteamDeck
jh72p37,"For games that won't run on Steam deck that's why. There have been many games that won't run, least with windows if it's on Steam it's gonna run, with Linux your left hoping it runs or waiting for proton to fix it. Or many side attempts to get the game to run when it just runs in Windows fine. Plus Windows ten & others have custom builds from Ghost Spectre that debloat the software.

say what you want. Until new games just work on deck Linux is terrible, windows is the best way to go it make deck a portable beast.   
Buy a Steam Game can't run it fine, dual boot to windows & run it there.",SteamDeck
jh96vel,"Do me a favor \*before\* you do anything else, create an instance of vanilla Minecraft, maybe just throw Controllable in it so you can actually play the game with the Steam deck. If that by itself is running like ass ignore the rest of my post, my best advice in this case would be try another launcher.

Clarification: You're running these packs separately? If you slammed a bunch of mods together I'd most certainly guarantee you're running into either a mod conflict or memory issue. 

Memory issue you just need to go to your mod manager's setting and allocate more memory/RAM allocation in the Java settings(8 gb seems to work fine, but you can always tweak it, more is better but I generally advise not maxing it out. I think the Steamdeck has 14Gb of user-usable RAM, I'd max out at 12Gb just to give your system some wiggle room if it needs it. Keep in mind my only qualifications are that I've been in your exact situation before and just googled a bunch of crap which is actually why I'm here)

Mod conflict *could* be a massive pain in the ass to solve, I'd suggest just sticking to one pack or another by themselves. Try looking for a ""kitchen sink"" mod pack like ""all the mods""(supports up to Minecraft version 1.19.2) or ""revelations""(goes up to 1.12) , it should cover your basics modding desires without needing to manually add a bunch of mods yourself. However, if you want to create your own pack, it isn't a bad idea to start off from another pack and add mods then check it occasionally as you go to make sure everything still works. 

Hopefully any of this information is useful and I'm not too long winded.",SteamDeck
jh9o4is,"Yeah, they're separate instances. Increasing the RAM did seem to work, though! Roguelike Dungeons and Adventures had almost no issues, and I'll be testing the other two in a minute.",SteamDeck

jh8hw3q,"I got the controller more or less working with Project Outfox by doing the following - start by doing what you did: use the touch screen to remap arrows to ABYX.  Then run the game, then go to Steam's preferences for the game and map the l-tek's ABXY buttons to the proper directional arrows.  That doesn't solve the problem of needing a second controller since the l-tek only has 4 buttons, though.",SteamDeck
jh9xorv,Just a quick followup. What I really needed was the capability to accept inputs from multiple sources at the same time as if they were all the same source. I wasn't able to get this to work in the steam deck's game mode because it always picks one controller and ignores the others. I did get things to work in desktop mode on the steam deck though. I have the L-tek controller mapped to XYAB and also have a ps4 controller connected by USB and I can map both at the same time in PSCX2 and in StepMania. So I use the directional buttons on the controller to change songs and use the dance pad buttons for accept/back.,SteamDeck
