If you adjust the brightness of your steam deck, I consider it tinkering.
If you think adjusting performance sliders is too much tinkering, how about those like me, who go compressing, resizing and cropping cutscene  bink videos just to get the perfect aspect ratio, video quality and optimal size for the steam deck?
Maybe that should be called ""tHinkering""",SteamDeck

jhk0x49,"I figured I'd add a couple of recommendations since I didn't see any games that I've been frequenting:

1. Diablo II Resurrected - Absolutely amazing on the SD and works great for playing either online or single player with no connection required.
2. Dauntless - Super fun to play mobile, although an internet connection is required, works flawlessly tethered to my phone with minimal lag
3. Hitman Trilogy - All of these games run great on the deck. Until this past year I've never played a single one of these games but absolutely loved them. I think you can play this with no internet connection, but  I can't remember.
4. The Division 2 - Runs smoothly on deck but it's definitely a battery sucker. I find shooters to be quite difficult on controllers, but since this is mostly PvM I don't mind so much. Requires internet connection to play. 
5. Madden 2022 / 23 - I don't even watch football, but for some reason football games are fun. Runs great, no internet connection required. 
6. Super Mega Baseball 3 - Very stylized, light, and fun baseball game. No internet connection required.
7. Mortal Shell - Runs pretty great. I've only put about 3 hours or so into this game, though, so I'm not sure how it fairs later on in the game. I got really confused with navigation and kept running around in circles and haven't picked it back up since. I should probably just ready some guides or something, because it was quite fun.

All of these, with the exception of Diablo II, are running off of an micro SD card running Windows 10. Games like Division 2  and Dauntless need Easy Anti Cheat and that doesn't work on Steam OS. Pretty amazing having a handheld Windows machine.",SteamDeck

jhis5fh,Played the first one soon after getting my Steam Deck. Recently got WotW on a discount. Can't wait to give it a try!,SteamDeck
jhj5kp4,"I prefer the first one tbf. Mainly because even if simplier, it feels more original in abundance of metroidvanias and rouge likes.",SteamDeck
jhipoh5,Been playing that myself. Fuck that game is gorgeous!,SteamDeck
jhk9c44,I am a huge fan of ori . But I find the screen in the deck a tad too small for it.,SteamDeck
jhjxedp,It‚Äôs for girls,SteamDeck

jhkr7xu,Just bought on sale! No clue what the dude above me is talking about!,SteamDeck
jhl141y,"I'm a little bit dumb and bought the game before it was on sale for me and my significant other haha 
Didn't expect a sale when the update released 

This would be a great time to buy haha",SteamDeck
jhknpbe,"Cult of the lamb is a terrible game. 

Sure, it might run well. And it might have enough battery life for just one more run. And the graphics might be cute.

But I‚Äôm done cleaning up puke and shit when I have 4 toilets, 2 cleaning stations, and only cook hearty meals. 

I‚Äôm going to start my own cult. With drug addicts and hookers. And I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be cleaner !",SteamDeck
jhj5tjm,Very cool game indeed,SteamDeck
jhk76ky,Can't recommend this enough. I played it on game pass and was hooked!,SteamDeck

That was my out of the box experience anyway",SteamDeck
jhjey58,"We say this, but the last 1/3 of every single run sees the game dropping to a solid >10fps.

Note: This really isn't an issue that affects gameplay.",SteamDeck
jhilxfw,It's a nice time killer.,SteamDeck
jhjslmj,"Only issue is that you can't run mods as easily as it should do. 

If you wanna just play the vanilla game, absolutely brilliant, but mods are a little awkward.",SteamDeck
jhk5sjr,I played this on the deck and it was out of this world. Definitely one of my favorite rpgs in a long time,SteamDeck
jhkz7l4,Prey is an absolute masterpiece on the steamdeck. Cant recommend this game enough.,SteamDeck
jhinf4g,you have to tweak anything to get mafia 1 running 60fps? i had everything graphics wise on low but was still dipping way below 40 sometimes,SteamDeck
jhk18yc,"DRG is the best game out, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt run at a stable 60fps on the Steam Deck (just because OP specified that). Maybe if you turn everything all the way down? But it looks pretty grim like that. 

It‚Äôs still totally enjoyable on the SD either way. 

STONE",SteamDeck
jhitruq,Rock and Stone to the Bone!,SteamDeck
jhipm8a,"It's 16:10 for a very good reason: It needs to be 768 or higher vertical pixels because of old game compatibility (the vast majority of games on Steam). The default resolutions for older games are 640x480, 800x600, then 1024x768. If they went with a higher resolution screen that would solve the trick, but this was the lowest resolution screen they could have gone with while still supporting 1024x768 for compatibility reasons.",SteamDeck
jhii45b,It's honestly my biggest pet peeve with the SD. The games that utilize the 16:10 aspect ratio are awesome but when a game only supports 16:9 it drives me insane lol,SteamDeck
jhisnal,"It sucks but I think the solution is that more games should natively support 16:10, though i can understand the annoyance of older titles that do make you wish for a 16:9 display. Steamdecks rise in popularity and rise in support by game developers who primarily put their games on there are more likely to support 16:10 in the coming years, in fact I would be surprised if hades 2 for example didn't support it on launch which originally had no support in the first, now a popular recommended game for steamdeck. This is just speculation, though, and I could be wrong and am partly coping. It just seems more plausible now than ever, considering previously they could not be bothered to support the minority who had 16:10 monitors for their desktop.",SteamDeck
jhj2laf,How's MD now? Last time I played it was on GamePass back in 2021. Is it easy to navigate menus with touchpads on a small screen?,SteamDeck
jhih5ii,"Pretty much every game runs perfectly well on the Steam Deck. If anything, I only had a handful of crashes during Sky the 3rd",SteamDeck
jhiz4az,Playing on the deck made me love crafting that i already leveled half of them to 90 !!!,SteamDeck
jhisvve,Requires tinkering... other than that I agree with you. Runs so good on deck.,SteamDeck
jhj0x2e,How did you get Arkham Asylum running well? I remember having to do some voodoo to even get it to launch and then the next day it stopped working for me.,SteamDeck
jhk6zej,I've heard that Crisis Core Reunion has also been running phenomenally.,SteamDeck

jhj3rdt,"I really tried to like ‚ÄúHave a Nice Death‚Äù as I‚Äôve loved other Rogue-likes such as Rogue Legacy, Hades, Dead Cells, etc. I don‚Äôt know why, but this one really just didn‚Äôt click with me at all. Nothing to do with the SD, it ran completely fine on it. Just something about the gameplay itself that doesn‚Äôt work for some reason. Hopefully other enjoy it though, seems really well made.",SteamDeck
jhk34rm,it says dredge in the post :D,SteamDeck
jhl2m3z,"I *just* finished getting all the achievements in that one. Best VS-like I've played! It's funny, has great art, and some good chiptunes!

Up next I have Rogue: Genesia...after 100%ing the new VS DLC, lol",SteamDeck
jhiujjr,"Unfortunately, from those that I know from this list, re2 and P5 don't support 16:10, agreed on the 40fps though, but at that point, we would just be recommending games as so many work just fine with a 16:9 40fps criteria.

Also, thank you for mentioning metal gear rising, I honestly had no idea it was even on steam and planned to emulate it like the others that are stuck on ps3",SteamDeck
jhiwk5z,Dwarf Fortress is good? Is the text legible? Still waiting on my Deck but I've been wondering how DF would look and control.,SteamDeck
jhiq7aw,How does valheim work flawlessly? You can either nuke the graphics or run it at 45 fps.  It also drains your battery in 90 minutes.,SteamDeck
jhj46un,Project zomboid runs fine but controls are rubbish out of the box. Navigating inventories with buttons is painful and trackpad as mouse doesn't work properly with drag and drop.,SteamDeck
jhjetj3,Apart from TLOU üòÖ,SteamDeck
jhijzc4,Yeah you're right RDR2 checks everything except 60 fps. Probably the most impressive game on the SD,SteamDeck

jhjy9vu,"Seconding this, it feels made FOR Steam Deck",SteamDeck
jhjxbhf,"Yeah a lot of people seem to be ignoring my prompt. A lot of games don't have 16:10, or their cloud saves also save graphics configs so switching between PC can be a pain. I was kind of looking for more specific examples",SteamDeck
jhkxyfp,does bf1 require third party lauchers?,SteamDeck
jhl2hma,Such a good game! I played it so much back in the day on my PSP. Those were good times,SteamDeck
jhl7qzk,If you ever played flatout back then it‚Äôs a mix of the two. Great game!,SteamDeck
jhl85zt,Wreckfest is great,SteamDeck
jhjgm8t,"Right! It was the first game I tried (after desk job, which for me counts more like a tutorial level for the steam deck) and I was absolutely blown away

jhk4ne6,Buy black mesa,SteamDeck
jhkewqb,"Definitely don't need to. You will find plenty of good summaries of the story, both video and written. It's entertaining, though even that isn't necessary to enjoy HL2.

If you end up loving HL2 (it's great), you can go back and play Black Mesa (Valve approved fan made update on the game).

It's also worth watching Freeman's Mind if you find yourself enjoying the HL universe.

Edit: fixed autocorrect, Mess to Mesa",SteamDeck
jhknlmw,Black Mesa is definitely the way to go if you want to play the story of HL1 before 2. It's a true labor of love and it shows,SteamDeck
jhii8cu,Yeah Hades comes extremely close besides the 16:9. I know there is a mod for 16:10 but does it disable achievements?,SteamDeck
jhj0u10,Strangely when I reduce the resolution to 720p it stretches to fill the 16:10 aspect,SteamDeck

actually glad i waited & got to play it first on the deck. same with a few other games like Hitman 2 & Yakuza games",SteamDeck
jhj6joi,"MGS5 is ***very*** well optimized and runs at 60 fps easy. 

If you tweak some settings you can get it to run at like 10-13 watts.",SteamDeck
jhj5uxv,"Don‚Äôt be afraid to push it! No game you play will just break your deck, it‚Äôs there to be played on. It‚Äôs more then capable of running even newer games which demand alot more power from the deck (look at cyberpunk running 30fps on it). These titles i listed are all on last gen consoles, besides rollerdrome.

Runs great at 60! I never noticed the fan noise while playing, so either they weren‚Äôt too loud or i had the speakers up loud enough to mask it. Either way you‚Äôll have a great time with it if you like stealth games. I got 94hrs out of it, most of it on the deck.

You can get it for under a fiver on 3rd party sites, or around the same when it‚Äôs on sale on steam",SteamDeck
jhj8luq,Nah doesn‚Äôt get too loud and surprisingly gets a lot more battery than other comparable titles I‚Äôve tried.,SteamDeck
jhjae07,"Like the other guy said, you won‚Äôt push it with most stuff, and it‚Äôs also true that you will *never* break your Deck that way. It‚Äôs designed to shutoff before any point of bad stuff happening is reached. If it makes you feel any better, I played 130 hours of Death Stranding on Deck - which is demanding af and at times horribly optimized for the Deck - and all was well. Temps were high at times but nothing happened. 

It handles MGSV fine though. Didn‚Äôt mess with any settings and 60 FPS just seems to work.",SteamDeck

jhik371,"Yeah, it‚Äôs a known issue with several games on the deck. It sucks, but dead cells does have a really good ‚Äúsave game‚Äù functionality where you can quit your run, exit the game, turn the deck off, come back later and start up again and just keep on going. It‚Äôs annoying, but it does work really well.",SteamDeck

jhj51ia,Why do I get so bored with this game? The constant backtracking and no map in new areas are killing me.,SteamDeck

jhjgub5,For Karl!,SteamDeck
jhij7de,I can feel you,SteamDeck
jhj6s5h,"Actually it works very well.
I don't really use the touchpads, I use it like a full controller and it works amazing.

D-pad up for the equipped items such as your bow or your ax.

R1 is the crafting menu and it's a radial wheel for everything.

I do recommend dropping everything to low for battery life, and switching it to DirectX 11.

With everything on high I get about an hour and a half of battery life, but with everything on low with the exception of textures I get about 3 hours of battery life.",SteamDeck

jhjuozw,"I've played a ton of FPS games on the Steam Deck, and it works flawlessly. Here's my setup:

Right Touchpad settings:

**100% sens** \- adjust in-game sensitivity. I have it set so with a full swipe of the trackpad from edge to edge, I do a 90 degree turn. Helps build muscle memory having the same.

**Trackball mode** \- ON, with High sensitivity. A quick flick will move the camera around 45 degrees.

**Horizontal friction 200%** \- I turn this all the way up so that when you make horizontal swipes in the heat of the battle, any accidental upward or downward movement doesn't throw your aim flying up or down.

Gyro settings:

**65% sens**. This will allow for much more minor adjustments when you need to be precise with your aim. I use Gyro a lot in battle and fights.

**On from right touchpad touch**. A lot of people use this only on left trigger pull or some other button activation, but learning how to use it seamlessly in conjunction with aiming on your touchpad is the best in my opinion.

**ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE BOTH MOUSE AND GYRO ARE SET TO ""AS MOUSE"". Using it as a joystick is a completely different feel and response.**

The idea here is to use trackpad and gyro as a tandem. The trackpad is all of your major camera movements, and should even be used to shift from target to target, but this gyro is used for things like tracing, precision aiming, and anything else that requires micro-movements.",SteamDeck

It's also opened up the opportunity to find more local CoOp games to play together with my wife and kid on the big TV! Now I also want to buy all the controllers üòÇ

It has definitely changed my purchasing habits, but I would say in a positive way!",SteamDeck
jhizbre,I've sold all non-exclusive Switch game cartridges and purchased them on steam. I've earned a bit.,SteamDeck
jhiznr1,Yeah I stopped paying for game pass and bought the games on steam,SteamDeck
jhj0ed5,"I don‚Äôt pay any attention to ‚Äúplayable‚Äù or not games. All my main ones are not considered playable. Conan Exile, GTA V, and recently D2R. 

I buy more games from Steam now though - I also enjoy searching through and adding games to my wishlist",SteamDeck
jhj0wpz,"Slightly. I've always been in the camp of buying shitloads of indie games on PC, so that hasn't changed with the Deck.

Likewise, being cautious about the state of big ticket PC games before buying them has also been a thing long before the Deck was announced. However, the range of the games I do buy has been narrowed - for example, if the port is fine but it's just too intensive or has incompatible anticheat. Those titles are few and far between, though.",SteamDeck
jhj1j96,"Somewhat. I was gaming on Linux before, so I was already checking ProtonDB for compatibility and mainly buying from Steam. Now that the Steam Deck has become my primary gaming device I tend to go for games which work better for the hardware and controls too.",SteamDeck
jhj1tr7,"I have been buying and playing way more indie titles like Ion fury, Dusk, Elderborn, Blasphemous etc. Been absolutely loving them.",SteamDeck
jhj21r1,"Absolutely, I started my journey with SteamDeck and purchase Steam games with Deck compatibility in mind. yet, I'm currently playing Deathloop and No Man Sky on Xbox Game Pass (streaming through MS Edge on Deck). With a strong WiFi connection, this is a great way to try games. Two different environments on one device. Of course emulating is an option too. This tech continues to blow me away.",SteamDeck
jhj2a51,If it‚Äôs not gold or better on protondb I don‚Äôt even bother anymore,SteamDeck
jhj2toy,"Yeah, it did change my habits a lot. I usually only buy during sales anyway, but I look specifically for Steam Deck playable at least now.",SteamDeck
jhj32h7,"For me, the only thing it's changed is my gaming habits in general, I used to be a chronic CSGO addict, ever since the SteamDeck, I actually play my library of 1500 games; not the full library of course, but I tried 170 games last year, beaten 15 games! Got my first platinum since 2020! 

It kinda helped me have a healthier habit with CSGO, notice now though that if I can play a game on controller, I will play it on controller, and if it's got Cloud Saves, so I can go from PC to Deck and vice versa, if there's no cloud saves, we only install on the Deck and play from there. 

Purchasing habits; only checking for Cloud Save and whether it's unsupported or not, if it's unsupported, check ProtonDB, if truly unsupported, hold off on buying till deep discount. The only unsupported game I've bought was Modern Warfare II 2022 

Last 6 months here are my purchases that I spent my own money on, no bundles:

Persona 5 Royal  
Crysis Remastered 2/3 (Steam Deck not in mind)   
Resident Evil 8 Winter's Expansion  
Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection  
Spider-Man Miles Morales  
Dead Space 2023  
Resident Evil 4 2023  
Sifu   


I've always been a SteamDrone shill for years, but the Deck has given me an even bigger reason to refuse to use other stores, I'm not willing to put up with any headaches from other Storefronts and the Deck has given me an additional reason to never falter since no Cloud Save / Ez Install = no buy. Like Sifu! Could've gotten it cheaper on Epic, but I'd rather pay 10 extra euros for a Steam Installation.",SteamDeck
jhj382k,I had like 60 games. Over the past many years. Now I have more than double that amount. Only because of Steam Deck. But also was possible because of disposable income since I did not have that much before. I am just concerned if I am able to finish most of them...,SteamDeck
jhj3spw,"I held off buying games in 2022 so I could afford a Deck in 2023. Now I'm working on my enormous backlog and trying not to buy anything until I've made some progress on the games I already own.

The games on the top of my wishlist will still be there when I'm ready, and they'll probably have better sales when I finally get there.",SteamDeck
jhj3us2,"No not at all, but that's more because I have a good pc for streaming and stream any game that doesn't work to my deck so I don't need to really think about whether it's verified or not.",SteamDeck
jhj46gr,"I didn‚Äôt have a steam account before I bought the deck. ‚ÄúPlayable‚Äù and the other labels, I often ignore those and look on protondb instead. I actually didn‚Äôt preorder a Sd when it was first announced because I thought the playable game list was very low based on the labels and that just isn‚Äôt the case.",SteamDeck
jhj4gum,No. I still make irresponsible choices.,SteamDeck
jhj4iew,I had recently had gotten some control on my spending on games on sale but now I just want to buy everything.,SteamDeck
jhj4k3n,Yes. I spend more money on games overall.,SteamDeck
jhj4kgm,"Yeah, I buy a ton load of games that I probably will never play üòÇ",SteamDeck
jhj4kmw,Nah still buying the games I wanna play. But if it doesn‚Äôt run well on steam deck I play then I play on PC,SteamDeck
jhj4mji,Way more indies and less AAA,SteamDeck
jhj4riv,"I've... bought a lot more games... I used to just have a handful of games in my library that all had atleast 400-1000 hrs on them. I now have those games that I mean to play but will likely never... Congratulations Valve, you got me.",SteamDeck
jhj4whq,"I‚Äôve been buying games for it that I would normally get for a home console. 
even thought it would look/play better on the home console, because it‚Äôs just so hard to not play it anywhere, even if that just means my backyard.",SteamDeck
jhj5evf,"I've been buying more porn games since getting the deck. Always felt kinda weird to play them on a computer, even though my GF has her own, but SD is just more personal.",SteamDeck
jhj5j79,Yep. I don‚Äôt buy games from anywhere except Steam now.,SteamDeck
jhj694u,I definitely look to see if there are launchers now. God I hate those. If a game doesn't have one I'm way more likely to buy,SteamDeck
jhj7riw,I played thousands of hours of rogue likes before I got my deck. Got really burnt out after spending 900+ hours on ROTMG. Never thought I‚Äôd pick up another one again. Yet over the past year and a half of having a deck I have bought dozens of rl‚Äôs just for the enjoyability of being able to just kick back and have a nice half a hour-hour long session.,SteamDeck
jhj8hq2,"I started buying games on Steam again, after years being console exclusive.",SteamDeck
jhj8obu,Absolutely. I pretty much try to buy everyone on the deck now instead as long it works well.,SteamDeck
jhj8oio,I feel like it made my purchasing habits worse than without it. I feel like I buy at least one game every two weeks to a month depending on price now.,SteamDeck
jhj8s3e,Yes,SteamDeck
jhj96vl,"Yes! In the past Id just buy whatever game I wanted whenever I wanted.

Now I throw games on the wishlist and wait until they reach a price Im willing to pay.

Mostly because there are so many games I want to play on the deck that I have a large backlog now, and am in no rush to purchase more to simply add to the backlog - can afford to be patient :)",SteamDeck
jhj9guk,It did 100% what the Steam Deck was intended to do by being sold at a low cost as a lead item: make me buy more game on Steam. My library used to be a total of seven games. Now it's nearly double that.,SteamDeck
jhjbln6,Yes. I'm buying even more games that I'll not have time to play.,SteamDeck
jhjc2bo,I guess it has made me rebuy some older games or actually purchase some Gamepass games because I feel they would be great on the go or want to replay them but not in a traditional way on the PC or TV/console.,SteamDeck
jhjcbhu,"Yes, I'll buy more controller-centric games now, even if I end up playing them with my Xbox controller at my desk, and sometimes on my Steam Deck.

I was previously a nearly-exclusive KB+M gamer.",SteamDeck
jhjcxi3,I was moving back towards console gaming until I got the steam deck. So the steam deck has gotten me to go back to steam,SteamDeck
jhjd20p,"When I initially got my Steam Deck I hadn't logged into my account since shortly after Half Life 2 launched. I also played some Counter Strike Source when it first launched. 

Now I am buried in games I bought on sale. Since August I have bought over a hundred games that I will totally get around to playing.",SteamDeck
jhjejdt,"I barely bought games before my Steam Deck and I still don't. Only games I bought after it was the rest of the valve complete collection and briefly skyrim special edition which I returned since I decided just to use the original version. And the valve complete collection wasn't even because of the Steam Deck.

I just don't wanna buy too many games when I still have several other games I have yet to complete. Although I did consider getting beamng.drive just to have fun driving around whenever I wanted but decided against it for now.",SteamDeck
jhjfg9h,"Yes and no for me. I have a full-force gaming PC that I do my main gaming on like COD, BF, etc however when games go on sale with the Steam Sales when I'm looking then ill see if they are SD compatible, if they aren't I just move right along because those are games I will probably never play on my main PC.",SteamDeck
jhjfp5v,I've spent more money on steam haha,SteamDeck
jhjfx7l,"Yes, in an odd way. I have previously used Steam sometimes to pick up old games I could run on my laptop and occasionally games that were on sale that I couldn't play at the time but figured I would ether upgrade my to a PC or time would win out next for another laptop. 

Now I have no excuses to buy and wait, I can play things now I've had on Steam for almost a decade so I have been slowly going through my backlog, whether new experiences or replaying old favorites, Vanquish and Fable as of late. It's just been hard to justify anything really new when I have 200+ games to go through.",SteamDeck
jhjh2wm,"I‚Äôve always preferred to buy games that launch from Steam over other launchers, even if another launcher still runs from Steam. But the last few years I started being more open to just run games from other launchers. Got tired of paying the Steam tax. 

Since getting the Deck I‚Äôm back to preferring games that can launch from Steam. I‚Äôm not that into tinkering or going into Desktop mode so I‚Äôd rather just be able to manage games from Steam.

I do have the Blizzard launcher installed as well as Minecraft and Roblox so I‚Äôm willing to do it I just prefer not to.",SteamDeck
jhjhdui,"This is going to sound heretical, but it's actually gotten me to buy more Switch games. Not for an emulator, just for the Switch proper.

The Deck has made me realize that the convenience of a handheld is very valuable, more valuable than max graphics or 165fps.

So I play a lot of Steam games, but also play a lot of Switch games. It works out great because in a strangely un-Nintendo move they allow developers to sell digital keys places other than the eShop, so you can get games that are Steam-cheap. dekudeals.com helps find them. Don't get me wrong, I also buy and play more Steam games than before. isthereanydeal.com helps find those.

So yeah I buy more Steam games than before, but I also have become much more receptive to handheld ""low spec"" gaming in general. I used to get hung up on ""can I run the game at max? do I have to use DLSS? let me pull up afterburner and..."" and now I just think ""can I play the game?"" and that's good enough.",SteamDeck
jhji43h,"I already had an older gaming PC and a newer gaming laptop with quite a few games on STEAM. 

&#x200B;

Although I'd occasionally buy games on STEAM directly more often than not I buy through places like Humble Store as I subscribe to Humble Choice.

I have bought a few additional games through STEAM since getting my Deck, but these were already on my wishlist so would've bought them sooner or later anyway.",SteamDeck
jhjipqd,"A bit, just bought Shadows of Doubt which released today and I am getting with stuttering about 20-30 fps but it is sort of playable, the developers mentioned they want to get the green Verified tick so that made me buy the game.",SteamDeck
jhjiwjj,"Yea, got more jrpgs and indies",SteamDeck
jhjj5bo,"Nope, still buying shit then not playing it",SteamDeck
jhjjdzd,"Not really. I mostly play potato games (and my gaming PC is from 2015, so the top of the line games I was rocking back then might be potato tier these days ;\_; ), so any games I buy are almost guaranteed to work on Deck. I do think that new Steam games should make an effort to be Deck compatible, although I'm not sure how realistic that is. I bought Hogwarts Legacy on Steam because I saw it was Deck verified, but I didn't enjoy how it ran at all. Even tried connecting it to my dock to play it on my big TV like a console and what looked iffy on the actual Deck's screen looked a million times worse on the TV where I'm regularly playing my media in 4K.",SteamDeck
jhjjp3s,"Yes, now I only look for deck verified games to buy",SteamDeck
jhjkr7f,"I definetly consider that when buying. I always check ProtonDB and if a game has cloud saves, so I can switch between PC and the Deck (The constant disconnecting from WiFi and ""could not reach Steam servers"" is extra annoying  in that case tho).",SteamDeck
jhjlfys,I just look at YouTube if the game runs. Won't ever bother it the game has any kind of rating.,SteamDeck
jhjma25,"I have gamepass and absolutely would not have bought Vampire Survivors and just opted to stream it on my phone if I didn't have a SD.  I also wouldn't be rebuying the entire Yakuza series, which I own on PS4.",SteamDeck
jhjofoz,I mean yeah but in the opposite way. Steam deck has way better performance than my old pc. So I get to play all those games that didn't work or barely ran.,SteamDeck
jhjpuyn,I haven't bought a game in a month. The Steam Deck as a back log killer is working for me. I have like 3 games to beat before I buy something that will most likely wait.,SteamDeck
jhjq6bb,"Yeah I use it! 
Never bought anything on Steam in the 8 years membership before the Deck.",SteamDeck
jhjrj3r,"still the same, just buying when discount regardless i can play it or not now.. (maybe someday i'll play my other backup pc that still using windows)",SteamDeck
jhjs7j1,"Yes, because the Steam Deck is currently my main gaming device/the only device on which I can access most of my Steam games. My gaming PC has served admirably, but has reached the end of its gaming career (it can stream games on GFN, but that's about it), and I don't have the time, energy, or budget to build a new one.

How playable something is on Deck is a huge factor in whether I purchase, and I try to look closely at not only how playable it is on Steam or ProtonDB, but also in what ways it is or is not playable.",SteamDeck
jhjswg7,"I didn't have steam predeck. Didn't have a pc. And now I do, and I spend a lot on it. So yeah I guess it's changed. As have my bank statements",SteamDeck
jhjt4v2,Not particularly. I get the games I wanted to play like I did before and generally they're compatible with the Deck anyway.,SteamDeck
jhjthdi,">Has the deck changed your purchasing habits?

Not at all. The Steam deck is only a companion to my PCs.

>What do you think this means for the future of game publishers that don't make any effort to make a game playable on the deck?

Until the Deck becomes a huge player on the market, nothing. As far as I can tell, 3 million units have been sold so far. Over 60 million people use Steam on a daily basis.",SteamDeck
jhjwkek,It really doesn't change my purchasing. If there's a game I want I will buy it primarily to play on my high-end PC. If it works on my steam deck then that's awesome.,SteamDeck
jhjzeff,It will be when I get a job lmao,SteamDeck
jhk0mx0,I find myself buying little knick knack indie titles that I wouldn't give the time of day on PC for the short burst of gaming on the go,SteamDeck
jhk0ybd,"Theres plenty of ""not supported"" games that work perfectly on the deck. I havent really changed my buying habits at all. Just spend less time on the computer and more on the deck now",SteamDeck
jhk1okr,I‚Äôve bought some more expensive titles since getting the Deck but I‚Äôll only buy what‚Äôs verified or well known to work on the Deck. My Deck is actually the most powerful games PC I have now so it‚Äôs gotta work on Deck if I‚Äôm gonna buy.,SteamDeck
jhk27ma,"No, I hardly ever used to buy Steam games before and now I‚Ä¶. Oh, wait never mind üò≥",SteamDeck
jhk4jgj,"I play a lot of indie games and rogue lite games now.

I used to just play management games and the odd RTS on my laptop.",SteamDeck
jhk4phn,Absolutely. Anything I look at has to work on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhk51qb,"Yeah I wasn‚Äôt buying anything on Steam for like 5+ years now. After Steam Deck, I bought so many my Steam friends were like ‚ÄúEnjoying that new Steam deck?‚Äù Lol they could tell by the sudden uptick in games added that I bought a Deck. 

All my game recommendations are from threads about MUST BUYS on Deck lol",SteamDeck
jhk588m,"I had a laptop that was serviceable for gaming.  Never did much on it because it was over 6 years old before I got it.  As far as buying on or for Steam, that's definitely changed.  Over 300 buys or free claims since January.  Before that, I had 13.

As far as Verified ‚úÖ, Playable, or Unsupported...... I don't really let that be a decision maker.  I have The Last Of Us Pt. I and WWE 2K23 on Deck.  Both say Unsupported but both are, in my eyes, playable.",SteamDeck
jhk6xke,"I never really used steam before I got my deck, I bought fall guys and kindergarten with it but that‚Äôs all.

Then I got my deck and I think I‚Äôve spent the same amount of money I paid for my deck on games üíÄ",SteamDeck
jhk941m,I went from buying one game a year to 4 biweekly,SteamDeck
jhka9x2,Yeah i purchase lamer games that it can handle,SteamDeck
jhkaj31,"I was already primarily a Linux user, so I'd always go for games that had good reviews on [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com). I only recently got my Deck so I haven't really bought any new games yet (and also my library is stupidly huge and has tons of games I haven't tried yet).

I still primarily play on PC, and just have my Deck so I can play games while traveling. So I doubt my purchasing habits will change much, though that ""Steam Deck Verified"" stamp will probably sway me when I'm on the fence about buying a new game.",SteamDeck
jhkawoo,I stopped buying because the steam deck is allowing me to tackle my backlog! Which is a good thing,SteamDeck
jhke5w8,"Yes, Prior I would shop around various launchers for the best sale / price.

Now almost exclusively Steam",SteamDeck
jhke65j,Yes it made me spend more money,SteamDeck
jhke6bk,"Yes it has, I don't purchase on deck since my gift purchase was for my spouse but was sent to a friend instead so yeah not buying anything on the device again",SteamDeck
jhkemxa,Nope if I wanna play it I buy it. So far everything has worked outside of changing proton versions on niche situations. Proton 8.0 here now though so maybe that'll be less a problem.,SteamDeck
jhkeqvk,"Not really. I do like to check how the games I buy run on Deck, but I don't rule out a game if it doesn't work.

That said, I'm experimenting with daily driving Linux on my desktop PC, so general Linux compatibility will matter more to me as I get more comfortable with it.",SteamDeck
jhkff4q,Very much so. It has been the tipping point to fully shift my game buying to 100% PC only.,SteamDeck

jhkfrrn,"I went from no computer, and 7 games on Steam from 10 years ago. Now I‚Äôm about to hit 90 games since being gifted a SD in January‚Ä¶",SteamDeck
jhkfzd5,I have definitely purchased more games. Especially once they are on sale. And I can also say that the games are more fit for steam deck which in my case means I play for 20 to 40 minutes and then come back later or the next day where I left off.,SteamDeck
jhkgnqx,I buy less now,SteamDeck
jhkgun2,[Grogu says Yesss](https://tenor.com/YSQyopzOjP.gif),SteamDeck
jhkit0d,It‚Äôs lead me to the brink of divorce. My husband said that I can‚Äôt buy any more games for awhile,SteamDeck
jhkj8dr,The switch was my main gaming console so it definitely changed my buying habits! I haven‚Äôt bought any switch games since I got my steam deck in March. I‚Äôve bought a few games I always wanted to play but mostly I‚Äôve been getting games through fanatical and humble bundle deals. I‚Äôm also playing a lot more gamepass games so it feels like I‚Äôm getting my moneys worth.,SteamDeck
jhkjr2o,"In the last few years I only purchased games for playstation but not for steam. For steam I had older games, eg. Old strategy games, and I usually bought very cheap games. Since I have the steam deck, Ive looked for more.indie games and platformers as I use it for mainly that purpose",SteamDeck
jhkk5y6,Yeah most games I get repacked are now being purchased if they're enjoyable and run on the steam deck. I know windows is a thing but the user friendly-ness of the stream deck in general makes me just straight up buy them so I can play them in bed.,SteamDeck
jhkk6ot,"Totally changed it.  I hadn't bough a game on Steam in 18 months.  Since getting the deck, it is almost the only place I will buy a game.  And if it isn't playable on the deck, I am not interested.

As such, I no longer pre-order much because I want to make sure the game will be compatible on the deck.",SteamDeck
jhkm4d8,"Erm, just a little.

Like many others I had a steam account and a couple of free games in my library, none i had ever actually played. PC gaming, I just couldn't get into it 

Roll onto buying the deck and my library now stands at 179 games. Ok, some have been codes bought thru cheaper 3rd parties (humble, cdkeys, greenman), but valve have definitely recouped their loss leading hardware with my software purchases! Am I upset....far from it. It's reopened gaming up for me and brought new adventures together for my son and I playing together!",SteamDeck
jhkmaa0,"Nope. Still follow the ""isthereanydeals"" lowest price ever. I think I'm grow old n still use the website for alerts when prices hit all time low",SteamDeck
jhkmu9m,"Not really. Most of the games that aren't compatible are from companies I had already been boycotting for years, anyway.",SteamDeck
jhknlhm,"It's definitely shifted which platform I want to buy from. Like I'd pay more for a steam game than I would for the same game on GoG and I'm also more tempted to re-buy games I already have on other PC stores if they're cheap enough. (yes you can play GoG games on deck, but getting them straight from steam is often much easier)",SteamDeck
jhkor9q,"I've been buying old games & trying to make them work. Currently, I'm playing XII, which is ""unsupported,"" yet plays better than Far Cry.

It's perfect for nostalgia. That's been quite a change, b/c I used to mostly stick to new-ish games. (Stuff that's just old enough to be on sale.)",SteamDeck
jhkp0w3,"I mainly bought it as a backlog destroyer and it‚Äôs doing that quite well for me. I also moved any game that was on Switch and steam off my switch wishlist and onto my steam wishlist because I mostly play games portably and would have have them on steamdeck 

So for sure it‚Äôs shifted some sales to steam/pc. 

But I haven‚Äôt increased the amount of games I buy or the type really (although I wouldn‚Äôt have bought vampire survivors had I not seen it on here, that‚Äôs really the only one though)",SteamDeck
jhkpvtz,I find myself purchasing Steam games much more often after having a SD. The fact that you can play great games that are under $10 on the go is great.,SteamDeck
jhkq9o5,Not at all. I almost exclusively use desktop mode. I just play what I want.,SteamDeck
jhks8xb,"Yes. It has encouraged me to purchase games that I otherwise would never have been able to play before owning a deck due to hardware limitations and affordability.

I've also purchased games/dlc for friends so we can play together, and the favors are reciprocated when they buy a game for me to play together with them! 

Definitely a bigger sense of community, which makes me want to continue purchasing titles to play together with friends.",SteamDeck
jhkt63l,Yeah buying a lot more older and indie titles now when before I used to just pirate them (allegedly) cause I don‚Äôt know how to remove viruses from Linux,SteamDeck
jhkttrf,I'm more likely to get a game on steam than playstation but that's about it,SteamDeck

jhivvaa,"I feel so dumb. Because I didn't like using 2 launchers I used to buy things on EA, Uplay Rockstar etc directly from them rather than on Steam.

jhioqj0,"I've been playing on linux exclusively since about 2015. Biggest difference the steam deck has made is that compatibility is so much better now that I don't need to research most games before buying.

My purchasing habits have definitely changed. I also only buy games that work on the Steam Deck with a heavy focus on Verified games. 

I have also shifted my dollars from buying physical releases for consoles to buying for the Steam Deck. When I decided to buy a SD, I decided to shift from bring a physical release collector to going back to being a gamer. 

My hope is that Steam Deck reaches critical mass so publishers can‚Äôt afford to ignore it as a platform and that SD owners will speak with their wallets. I have many quite a few game purchases since I bought the Deck.",SteamDeck

But also, it has me playing more. And I've finally started games that I bought on sale long ago but never started.",SteamDeck
jhiqafs,"I buy a lot more games now. But also they are generally not the AAA title I always got for my other systems.  Deck is the first system that makes me want to play indi games, retro style games, relaxing nonsensical games.

It's strange but this style of play has brought back my love of gaming like when I was a kid.",SteamDeck

Dredge) or only want to play it on my PC (ie. Jedi survivor when it comes out) Mostly for graphics and 60fps sensitivity",SteamDeck
jhkyrpi,"Yes. Before the deck I purchased a total of 0 things from steam. I am now at 120 games and I only thing I‚Äôm really playing at all is Genshin on my phone, so my priorities are not in the right place.",SteamDeck
jhkyubw,"Used Steam since its inception, but hardly used it over the years since I mostly played WoW/D3. Now I purchase games exclusively on Steam because of my Deck (even spending more). Epic isn't a great store, but they do have some great offers on from time to time.",SteamDeck

jhl263d,"I've bought a few games that I already own, free from other stores. Some I have played and love, but now want to play on the go. And others that I never did play, but see mobile as the perfect platform for them. It's also got me buying and playing more side scrollers, since on the PC I usually prefer to play a big AAA title. But I don't enjoy them as much on the deck, even if they run perfectly, so the side scrollers have been just right.",SteamDeck
jhl2bxi,Yes.  I sold all my consoles and use steam deck exclusively.,SteamDeck

jhl2v43,"The biggest thing is that I will no longer get any game on any other launcher. I used to not really care that much, especially if it was an offline game. But now, there have already been several occasions where I paid more specifically to get a game on steam instead of Epic or Origin",SteamDeck
jhl3h9c,"YES. I got around one game every few months before getting the Steam deck, and one every two weeks or so after.",SteamDeck

jhl62hb,"So many people saying they'd rather have a steam copy even if it costs more SMH.

I'd rather have a GOG copy than a steam copy... Though to an extent the steam deck has changed my mentality in that I do wish I had easier access to certain steam features (streaming & input mapping) for games I downloaded with heroic. I also wish heroic launcher had playability status sync since right now I have to manually cross check verified status.

But I'm wondering if the experience on windows will be better or worse than SteamOS. Like what specific advantages does SteamOS bring? I should probably make that a separate post though...",SteamDeck
jhl6t9v,"Yes, they tricked me into buying games when I usually wouldn't",SteamDeck
jhl7089,"I actually found myself purchasing more ""playable"" or even ""unsupported"" games then verified ones. Lately I've been playing a lot of Skul, which is classed as unsupported, but has absolutely zero issues",SteamDeck
jhl8gpq,"Oh absolutely. So many games I have purchased in the last 6 months, completely dictated by ""oh this would be good on the deck""",SteamDeck
jhl979i,"My purchases didn't increase until maybe a month later after owning the Deck. I thankfully had a small backlog of games I could play from the start that was supported. I did install some unsupported games like Star Trek Online. And now my purchases is maybe twice every other month. 

For those saying they've paid more on the steam storefront, I hear you loud and clear but there is a way around it.

jhlbbym,"Not really, no. Quite frankly, I simply don't buy many games anymore unless it really is something that I've been looking forward to for a while. I did buy Diablo 2 Remastered on sale, but that's just cause it's on sale. BTW works fine on the deck, albeit a little small.",SteamDeck

jhiv654,"It isn't necessarily a bad ranking system, the problem seems to be that it is a monumental task for them to take on and keep their ranking up to date. If a patch is introduced into a game, it can break something and cause a game that was previously fully functional turn into one that simply can't launch. So they would need testers to retest every game that updates. Since valve has a limited number of employees available to do this testing, it makes it easy to miss such an update or just be slow to respond to it. 

Since ProtonDB is open to all of us to report our findings on, they have a lot more people available to do the testing, and even find the fixes needed if it doesn't run. This speeds up the process and keeps things up to date much better, with more accurate info.",SteamDeck
jhiwb31,"Even better tip is to install ""Decky"" from Github and then get the ProtonDB plug-in. It puts a little badge next to games that you can click and go straight to the protonDB page. Super convenient",SteamDeck
jhjg11f,"I don't think it's a bad ranking system, I'd say that it's just overly cautious about any potential hiccups the game might have on steam deck. The way I see it, for something to be completely 'steam deck verified' it must play in a way that a console gamer would expect on a handheld gaming console. This means all the UI scales automatically to the size of the screen, that the default graphics settings perform very well, and that any prompt for text input, account sign-ins etc are as seamless as possible. If a game lacks just one of these aspects, then it's not 'verified'. It doesn't mean the game isn't playable! It just means that the experience will rely on the user getting past some tweaks to settings or some awkward text input.It's clear that Valve really wants to reach audiences that have never played games on PC before, and a great way to make the steam deck experience feel familiar is by advertising the games that are the closest to the console experience.

I know many avid console gamers that are not very techie people and having to remember how to manually invoke the on-screen keyboard, or tweak graphics settings is a legitimate challenge to them. This is not something they expect to encounter on mainstream gaming consoles, as all those games are delivered specifically for that system, and not just PCs in general.",SteamDeck
jhklmdv,"ProtonDB also has the benefits of being able recommend Proton GE, which include some media encoders that Valve can't include in their build due to commercial licenses",SteamDeck

jhkn59t,Interesting... I never had issues with it while playing a Steam game...  Well... The battery drains so.. a few times I ran out of battery before resuming the game :D,SteamDeck
jhjbntj,"I think part of Valve‚Äôs approach to their testing effort is to crowd source which games they need to retest while building out their badge ratings for games they haven‚Äôt tested yet. 

For games they have rated, they display an inline banner in the game launch/details page which asks users if their badge rating is accurate or not. 

To keep up with developer updates, my guess is Valve reallocates testing efforts toward the games that users are reporting Valve‚Äôs badge rating is inaccurate.",SteamDeck

Personally I think valve should be a little more lenient for older games (more than 10 years old), especially for minor nitpicks like one-time keyboard entry for a character name in an RPG. It's different for games with small text or other persistent issues.

It's not realistic to expect older games to ever get updated for deck, and I think it kinda misrepresents the experience that some of them are marked as playable instead of verified.",SteamDeck

You can set a standard Proton version in the settings which will be used for games with the status ""unknown"" and ""unsupported"". If you change the standard Proton version (it will not automatically change to the newest version), it is then updated and used with that games.

Verified games (""verified"" and ""playable"") use a specific Proton version defined by Valve. For instance, Alien Isolation on the Steam Deck does use Proton 6.3 (despite having a native Linux version), until Valve will test it with a different/newer Proton version.

1.

Once I switched it to 12 bit color after getting a HDMI to displayport cable, my god what a difference it made.

Perhaps the deck is only outputting 8 bit color and that's why it looks fucked?

HDMI 2.0 bandwidth can only support 8 bit color at 60 FPS, HDMI 2.1 can only support 10 bit at 60 FPS. A displayport to HDMI cable can display 12 bit color at 60 FPS. Meaning an official dock from Valve +an HDMI to displayport cable should have the best results for color output. The valve dock has a displayport port, jsaux's dock only has HDMI. 

If you can even change the color but depth on Linux that is.

Otherwise, the only real option for HDR atm is dual booting windows. It would be solid to have the ability to change the color depth on Steam OS.",SteamDeck

I have the JSAUX dock because I bought my deck before the official dock released, so unfortunately I can't test it for you.

The color bit depth makes such a crazy difference in output, video, videogame and color quality. It almost looks like a higher resolution.

I thought TV was straight up broken, but it turns out most of the issues I was having was the 8 bit color depth output. Most of my issues magically resolved by enabling 12 bit color.",SteamDeck

Don't touch the upscale thing - PCSX2 should already be setup to run at 2x rendering, at least mine was, still is, and in my opinion it looks great.

Almost constant 60fps, too.

jhip9i2,"Including a case with the deck was a wonderful move on Valve's part. Knowing that the cheaper Deck's are sold at a loss, and they still chose to include a case is just fantastic.",SteamDeck
jhkjk6e,I think what says it all is that valve use them as the protective packaging when they send them out. They know they're going to get thrown around in transit so they must have faith in them.,SteamDeck
jhkl3xg,"That they include the case at all is an amazing deal. I wonder how much of it was because (until recently, and only in asia) the Deck was being shipped direct to consumers. 

Maybe Valve saw what bigger, more protective boxes and packaging were going to cost to ship and realized it wouldn't be that much more expensive to just include a case with smaller boxes to ship. 

In any case I actually kinda disagree about how protective the stock case is. Twice mine landed on its corner after falling out of my backpack and both times I had to snap the two sides of the shell back together. Not the end of the world, but that second drop finally convinced me to get a grip and a new carrying case from jsaux.",SteamDeck
jhj8zxh,"> they still chose to include a case is just fantastic.

Independent of whether the 64 GB model is sold at cost or at a loss, I think it also saves on RMA costs, as fewer people will carry an unprotected Steam Deck around in backpacks.",SteamDeck
jhiyxzc,"> Knowing that the cheaper Deck's are sold at a loss  

are there actually sources on this now?  

It's such a common saying, but I've never seen solid reasoning, *especially* when not considering R&D cost, which I wouldn't in this wording (""Valve is losing money on their Steam Deck Project"" would be a better wording in this case, because they are not losing more money by selling more devices).  

Videos basing cost of parts on the [iFixit parts cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSL89u19w4) seem insanely stupid, especially when comparing to actual [BoM analysis](https://report.counterpointresearch.com/posts/report/component_tracker/category:Teardown%20and%20BOM), which I haven't found for the Steam Deck though, so maybe I'll learn something.",SteamDeck
jhjf0kp,Yeah I really like the fact that they did that at first I was like man no special box but then saw that the case was good condition I which the swtich came with that really all handhelds should,SteamDeck
jhla1fg,They also way reduced the packaging to compensate. Smart move.,SteamDeck
jhk3t4a,"Not really Valve‚Äôs responsibility if people drop them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I just see the case as another example of Valve not cheaping out on us. The Deck also features really good speakers. They could‚Äôve put something crap like the Switch uses (why does nobody else complain about this?) but instead they put great speakers that reviewers and users alike praise and appreciate.",SteamDeck
jhj6mw6,"For what it‚Äôs worth, BoM analyses aren‚Äôt gospel and don‚Äôt include other outside costs like R&D, advertising, and labor. The only company that really knows the true cost of making and marketing the Deck is Valve, and privately held companies like them have the tendency of remaining tight-lipped about that sort of thing.

They are interesting to read though.",SteamDeck

jhk9t5a,"BoM costs are often very misleading.

The BoM for a modern CPU is often less than one dollar. It's just a few ounces of copper and silicon after all. 

...and it ignores the *billions* of costs to manufacture them, let alone the R&D

BoM costs are only really relevant for simple goods, like when tallying up the costs of a construction project and you're looking for how much the concrete and steel, etc, will cost before adding in labor costs.",SteamDeck
jhk6tjt,"Valve can ultimately refuse warranty repair if the customer is deemed responsible for the damage, but it will still cause work for their RMA department. Also some problems may not be immediately obvious until the device is opened.

Not to mention that the Steam Deck is a means to get people to play&buy more games on Steam, and if people are out another $399 then that money cannot be spent on games. Reducing the risk of accidental damage is therefore both in Valve and user interests.",SteamDeck
jhk3uk4,"sure it's a good deal, and I'd not say that Valve makes a killing on them.  

If I had to guess, low end covers their cost per device/tiny margin. Enough High End Sales will cover their dev costs.  
The Price point is ""painful"" because isolated making and selling it makes no sense, takes too long to make an overall profit with a decent risk (well, probably not too risky anymore, but they couldn't know that), but it overall makes sense for valve to open up a new market, increase games sales to more ""console-gamers"" and weaken their reliance on windows.  

Laptop Makers have more SKUs to manage, more marketing costs, have to make their R&D money back with the device and need to cover shitty products which don't sell and then still want some profit on top.  
They also have bigger and more expensive screens and Batteries, but still, great deal certainly.",SteamDeck

jhggr7p,"Yes! I was starting to think, ""Am I the only person who sees this and immediately feels discomfort?"" All that weight in a narrower package would not be better. 

Also, you would have to start stacking components which would make upgrading a nightmare as well as hellish thermals.",SteamDeck
jhh00o3,You're prolly right. It would prolly put strain on your wrists.,SteamDeck
jhfzjmu,Your wrists would suffer more for sure,SteamDeck
jhgoi2x,"If they centered the weight up/down across where you grip it, I think it'd be pretty similar. If the weight was balanced across the height of the device you'd have a constant torque holding it.",SteamDeck

jhh5ub2,The exhaust fans from the massive graphics card they would add could potentially provide some thrust to reduce effective weight.,SteamDeck
jhh4g8q,"Likely it would not be. Placement of components in relation to where you hold it means you would need to tense your fingers while holding it instead of letting it ""rest"" in your hands. That would mean your hands get tired quicker. So it would not be more ergonomic.",SteamDeck

jhiv8pk,This is the way.,SteamDeck
jhgzhcl,"If you haven't already, I recommend mapping the back buttons. Really helps in E.R.",SteamDeck
jhivhl2,I think there‚Äôs just a normal adjustment period. For my hand placement I don‚Äôt find the back buttons useful for elden ring.

jhgzo28,Gotcha thanks I will look into that I just gotta look up how to do that. I was just wondering if I can use the left pad as an d pad,SteamDeck
jhh0zgk,"By default it should act as a D-pad. I always felt it was a little too easy to press the wrong direction on it, but that doesn't mean you'll have the same experience.

To enable the back buttons, hit the steam button while you're in the game. Push right on the D-pad once the menu is up and you should see a ""configure controls"" or something similar button. From there you can enable and map them.",SteamDeck
jhid6gb,"Just wait until you dive into the options available in the controller customization settings. It's amazing, and one of the best features of the device that nobody really talks about.

Steam input is a godsend, truly.",SteamDeck
jhj3sg8,"For real. Steam Deck is not only my favorite gaming device, but also my favorite controller now. Whenever I'm playing on the TV with a DS5 controller I play worse because of the missing buttons. Obviously you can customize DS5 via Steam input as well, but there's just less to work with.

Usually on portable platforms there is a level of sacrifice with controller ergonomics, but with the Deck it feels like the reverse when switching to a traditional controller.

I've logged over 90 hours on Fallout 4 in the past couple weeks. The game is marked as best played with mouse and keyboard but the Deck handles it with no problem.",SteamDeck
jhl2u4n,"It's the only controller I've ever used that is tolerable with games that rely heavily on mouse.

Though I'd still very much say that the game is worth $20 regardless. It's an amazing game, and personally my third favorite game of all time currently behind Terraria and MOTHER 3 tied.

I'd also suggest Terraria as well, since it's only $10 on Steam, but even if I love the game to bits, I will say that the game can be very overwhelming and confusing for newcomers. There is a guide NPC in the game that can help a bit, but they can only do so much, and you'll probably have to look at the game's official wiki to figure a lot of stuff out. Though it's not all bad, as the game does have what's called ""Journey Mode"" which makes things less difficult at the start with better starting items, and allows for full item duplication to make obtaining stuff pretty easy, among other features.

jhjbesh,"Ah!  A claw user!  I developed a good claw grip back in my PS2 days playing Armored Core.  Sadly I don't find it comfortable *at all* on the steam deck, otherwise I'd use it more often.  Instead I just take advantage of the bumper wrap-around and kinda nudge it with the first part of my index finger if I need to pull it while also pulling a trigger.  It's not super graceful, nor comfortable, but 75% of the time it works 100% of the time :)",SteamDeck

jhgv1ht,"My buddy is like you. I try to motivate him to using the desktop mode so he can learn some new things but he‚Äôs scared to mess with Linux. I recommend taking it little by little. If you know how to operate windows then Linux will be ver similar but if you don‚Äôt then here‚Äôs what I recommend learning/doing  first. 

1. Just learn how to search for stuff on the web browser by pressing the select button (idk what it‚Äôs called) + x it allows you to use the keyboard and by pressing those combinations again it will close it.

2. To download some apps, you can use the discover store to search for apps and download them. Like google, emulators, and ect. Just take the time to click and search and after a while, you will get better at it.

3 after getting used to that, I recommend downloading a program called wine. It even looks like this emoji üç∑. What this program does is allow Linux to run window programs. (Not all of them work but a good majority of them do). This will be the experimenting part that you will start to get better at. Even natives still have to tinker with programs sometimes just to see how they can get things to work.

4. Learning how to open folders and get to your destination. Take it little by little and you‚Äôll soon get better at it. Heck even I‚Äôm still learning where some places are.


And from there you will slowly grow your knowledge.

I can simply say ‚ÄúI hope [feature] gets added.‚Äù And someone will scream ‚ÄúWELL YOU KNOW THERES A PLUG-IN RIGHT?!‚Äù

I‚Äôm a stock settings kinda guy now. The plug-ins glitches out multiple times and I said nope. Never again.",SteamDeck
jheg32b,I wasn't for a while then had the urge to. Considering there's a tutorial for almost everything you'd want to do it just makes tinkering alot easier and accessible,SteamDeck

jhegeh7,"My tinkering consists of things that don't require ""dialing in"" if it can help, and I just need to run a program then that's awesome! I've loved the steam deck, and since I figured out how to stream/ play games from my PC, it's amazing at home on the couch!",SteamDeck

jhehd6y,"I don't, I find it tedious and really annoying.  Most mouse and keyboard peripherals don't work properly.  Everything is slow in desktop mode. The most I do is add mods to things and that's a chore to even get it in the proper files.  Also, fun fact I'd if you have a ps5 controller connected and a wireless keyboard and track pad mouse setup. The ps5 controller has major interference with it and will override your track pad making it useless.  I just want a mouse and keyboard to be fluid and its not. So yes, I basically just use the deck as is because even thinking about doing an emu deck sounds exhausting when navigating files takes twice as long..",SteamDeck
jhehh82,"Yes, same here. I‚Äôve had it since last year. I believe u got it in July of 2022 and it was the 512 model. I haven‚Äôt even used an SD card as of yet. Just how it‚Äôs been out of the box. I am going to get the official dock this June/July. And possibly a 512 to 1gb SD card but it‚Äôs been all just out of the box so far and I‚Äôve enjoyed it quite a bit.

But I have always been aware that mentality locks me out of lots of stuff, which Deck ownership has largely let me access in a form factor I enjoy.

I have mainly been playing Elden Ring, Days Gone, and RDR2.  So far I have not experienced any need to drive me to tinker with Cryo or Plugins.

I tweak settings a little for every game to get a good balance of performance and battery life. I care a lot about battery life and the out of box experience usually has room for improvement in that regard.

I might install some emulators, but haven't yet, so much else to play. Haven't installed any non-Steam games yet either, though there are a handful I might try some day.

Oh, and I modded a few games here and there, pretty minor stuff and mostly copied over from my laptop I used to use for gaming.

I'd say my game time on Deck is 50/50 between my Steam Library and emulation. I probably wouldn't have paid out the cost of a Deck purely for the exclusive stuff that is directly on Steam and not available elsewhere.

That said, now I have it, I find I buy games on Steam rather than Switch now because Steam will be more forwards compatible.",SteamDeck
jhf7w2m,"The most 'tinkering' I do is using the deck as a normal PC in desktop mode when docked half the time.

jhf9oao,I'd assume 80 percent of the people who own it may have only at the most used decky or done nothing to their deck and play it as is. Things you see on Reddit make up a very very small percentage of the user base same with YouTube and other social outlits,SteamDeck
jhf9obg,"I tinker... why? Simply because I can. If there's a setting to change, it will be changed at some point 

90% of my games will run fine first try, but if I can eek out a little more performance or efficiency you can bet I'll find out how to. As for that other 10%, I just want to make it run, even if I'll never actually play it beyond seeing my work be successful 

Will I appreciate that slightly more pretty scene? No. Will those 12 extra frames help me? No. How about the extra 30 minutes afforded by limiting wattage and clock speeds? Maybe it's useful twice a year",SteamDeck
jhf9q4q,Depends on what tinkering means? Haven't used Decky loader but use CryoByte utilities.,SteamDeck

I got KH2 randomizer working on the deck, which took bottles, navigating programs with no UI, installing things with scripts, and eventually adding it all to steam and making it work, and I've sunk less than an hour into the game after all that work.

I just enjoy the process of getting something to work, moving on, then playing it later if I finally want to. Most of the games I actually end up playing through on deck are ones that require no initial setup and just worked properly from the start, but I really enjoy tinkering and messing with stuff to get it just how I want to.",SteamDeck

jhfa56k,"While I intend to tweak and mod later, for now I'm content with cursing at EA's launcher until Mass Effect legendary edition loads lol. About the only real tweak I've done was set the Gamescope stats to occupy the top black bar when i set games to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. It's only 80px tall but that's a total of 102,400 pixels the Deck doesn't have to worry about lol.

Or to really blow your minds... 2.66x the pixels displayed by the Gameboy Advance! That all fits in the tiny 40px wide strip at top and bottom lol

The other tweak is switched to Old fan curve when I'm outside, and new fan curve inside (or just when it's cool weather)",SteamDeck

jhfh79p,"First of all - I guess I envy you. If you're happy with it the way it is, that's honestly great.

What I've personally done: 1. I've installed Fantastic - a plugin that allows you to have more fan control. Honestly, this one is the only mandatory one for me. I played a lot of undemanding games, which with the default SD settings means that the fans don't have to run at all, until the components heat up enough, then they kick in into quite fast RPM, then they turn off completely again. This was really distracting to me.

2. Vibrantdeck plugin - simply just better screen saturation.

3. PowerTools plugin - i wanted more charging control, e.g. being able to force charging off when wanting to play plugged in with a partially depleted battery to conserve battery health. Honestly, in my experience, the battery control has a mind of it's own most of the time, so I couldn't even really recommend it at this time. Maybe it's actually not even worth it fussing about with this, but who knows how the battery will hold up with in time?",SteamDeck

Something like Decky Tools, Cyro Utilities quite literally take a minute each.

Decky Tools let's you change boot animations, themes, really cool stuff.

Cyro Utilities gives you slightly better performance in most games.

Here recently I took it a step further and went into the hidden bios options and oc'ed my Deck but found diminished returns. But even then, that took maybe 5 minutes or so.",SteamDeck

jhfkrgj,I don't. Just play games on it,SteamDeck
jhfktnq,"I tinkered, like swapping out for a 1TB ssd, using cryoutilities to tweak settings, just general comfort/performance increases, installing emudeck,...
But I do just play. Those were initial things I did just to get more comfortable with the device and tinkering is what I enjoy. After building a new computer or reinstalling windows, I set things up just the way I like and then just not tinker much either.

Did the same with my switch, my model can handle cfw out of the box, so I've set that up. Now I can play it with whatever controller I want, backup saves, install my games to the device instead of switching cards, ... And I'm sure it's why I played it quite a bit because of it. Of course, my Steam Deck replaced it entirely (that is, until the new Zelda game is out).

You absolutely don't have to tinker. I can advise cryoutilities to get better performance, but if you like it, then don't. Oh, and the plugin loader to find tested settings to have great performance but lower battery usage. Again, nothing you absolutely need (SD works perfectly out of the box), but these are small additions I greatly appreciate.",SteamDeck

jhfowp2,"I literally had my deck for an hour before tinkering with it because Desktop mode doesn‚Äôt have a built in On Screen Keyboard without turn on Steam for whatever forsaken reason.

Plus I‚Äôm a huge fan of Mecha and Anime games, so they either don‚Äôt work cuz of EAC or just meh cuz they aren‚Äôt fully supported.

It was pure luck that DNF Duel ironically ran better on the SD vs PC since the screen tearing issue didn‚Äôt exist on the SD. Then luckily Capcom didn‚Äôt put EAC on Battle Network Legacy Collection so I can play that online with no problem. 

I had to do A LOT of digging to find Linux EAC just to run Gundam Evolution on it. Granted I can‚Äôt play online but I can at least do everything else on it.

Then again if I wanted to fix those issues I would have to at least put Windows on it at the cost of other issues.

Like if you can do everything you wanted to on your SD just fine then I wouldn‚Äôt bother tinkering with it. I bought mine as an excuse since my laptop can‚Äôt run Linux and I didn‚Äôt have my desktop yet so tinkering was the first thing I was going to do.",SteamDeck

jhfpvcn,"You don't HAVE to tinker.  Just keep an open mind that you CAN if you encounter a game that either doesn't run or doesn't run well.  Lots of guidance in the community to help you out, if it's ever needed.

If I were to recommend one almost-zero-effort, lots of bang for your buck software mod, even if you did nothing else, it would be downloading the Decky Loader/Vibrant Deck combo.  Ten minutes of your time will get you a decent saturation upgrade on the native Deck screen.  It's a big improvement, getting rid of the default screen dullness.",SteamDeck

jhfqkgc,"I would say i tinker a little with it. I put some RetroArch and emudeck on it, adjusted fsr to get a steady framerate, improve resolution.  But nothing too serious. I don't plan on doing any upgrades to it. I have already had the internal storage upgraded to the SSD 512 ( previous owner did it) and i bought a 1 tb micro SD SanDisk extreme.  Only thing i would do is if anything broke to just go to the ifixit website and order replacement parts( hopefully that's a long way down the road). It really does work good right outta the box.

also this just works It just fits in my hands and has the best feeling controller i have held in a few

so yaa over all 7.2 /10 for me 6/10 cause only one usb an keyboard problems other wise yaa

Valve has done enough to build up the platform to satisfy people like me who just want games to work out of the box. When I saw the SD Verified program, that was the final factor that convinced me to get the Steam Deck.

jhfwlsm,"I started that way, but yeah.. I've now got a thermal pad on the CPU and that JSAUX backplate, that combined, drop my temps a few degrees, while also making the fan quieter. I can get most AAA games to run at 35FPS max settings and indie titles (and even DOOM) at 70FPS. That extra 5-10 FPS (~15% performance increase) with less noise just looks and feels a bit nicer than stock. I hear that extra fan attachment JSAUX sells ACTUALLY does something for temps, but that's crossing the line for me. XD If I have to bring something else with me, I don't want it. 

But yeah, CryoUtilities 2.0 (with RAM at 4GB in BIOS) and Power Tools, that unlocks SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading?) are a must. Having the saturation up a bit is also nice with the Vibrant Deck (?) plug-in, and then having the HLTB (How Long To Beat) as well as the random game selector plug-ins also just make it easier to get to and through games when I can't pick. Hope that helps! 

Note: If you're going to do this, be aware that the back panel on your system WILL be hotter than stock, but it's only an issue if you set your Deck down on your bare leg for an extended period of time. ü§£",SteamDeck

jhg9lyh,I‚Äôm an out of the box user. The only thing I ‚Äútinkered‚Äù with was installing the battle.net app,SteamDeck
jhga2t7,Ive been spending more time watching content than actually playing games on my Deck. I‚Äôve mostly been using my Steam Deck recently as a player for Dragon Ball from an external HDD.

jhgbdl2,"I think tinkering is at the heart of PC Gaming, so the Deck being a device that appeals to both PC Gamers and console gamers you will see the 2 groups collide in this aspect, in my books it's great that Valve provides a great experience out of the box, but allows the usual culprits to dive into the innards of the OS or the hardware.",SteamDeck

jhgddak,"I've probably opened the deck more than I've played it lol. The haptics power supply on the right board is connected by a jumble of soldered wires and spare cable connectors from a repair I did, the RB and LB buttons have been completely replaced with the switches of Xbox One controller Sync buttons (they're a lot clickier, pleasant surprise after the old ones started to show age), the shell and triggers have been swapped out with the iFixit replacements, and the shell itself has been touched with a teensy bit of vaseline around the plastic connection tabs to eliminate any creaking. So I think I'm probably the exact opposite type of user lol üòÖ

jhghmlc,"Yup. I originally planned to install Retroarch and use my Deck to emulate DS and Gameboy games, but I've just been using it for my Steam games. The only extra thing I use is a USB C hub for HDMI out. I don't even have Chrome installed from the library.",SteamDeck
jhghqiu,"I don't even play mine a lot, I use it mainly as a desktop",SteamDeck
jhghsh9,The most I done was install emudeck but everything and install heroic games to be able to play GOG and epic games.,SteamDeck
jhgi2nt,I run it as is. Only mods I've done were the ssd and the gulikit sticks and the sticks were a why not thing since it was relatively cheap and easy compared to putting Xbox elite 2 sticks in a dualshock 4. I already struggle to have time to game in the first place.,SteamDeck
jhgi8h3,"Mine just sits and collects dust. I wanted to like it so much, but something doesn't resonate with me. Maybe it's the size of the device, or SteamOS, not sure. I have an Odin Lite on the way though, so I may end up selling it off.",SteamDeck

jhgljmm,"I enjoy that I can tinker on the device, even if that‚Äôs just setting up emulation for a bunch of stuff in case I want to use it later, but also actually use it as a primary gaming device. 
But as someone in tech it‚Äôs fun that I can use the device for both things. It‚Äôs a computer so I use it like I would a gaming PC. It‚Äôs nice when it works out of the box and it‚Äôs nice when you can get something going that you‚Äôre interested in that isn‚Äôt available elsewhere.

I have not opened up mine since Valve spooked me into not upgrading my 2230 drive while under their warranty.

If you don't want to tinker with it... then don't do it. Tinkering has a very broad term on the Steam Deck too, you have to play with all the onboard options to get the performance you want out of EVERY game.

For all the tinkering, you basically need to do it in desktop mode. Everything you could want is either from the discover store and requires configuration after installation, or you are downloading something from a website like emudeck.com or something else which requires konsole.",SteamDeck
jheq6bt,"Depends. If you can do it in gaming mode it usually works better in gaming mode since that is what the deck is designed for. But you specifically need the desktop version to do certain things like downloading non steam games into the deck or going into the filepaths. Basically if you could do it on the PC without ever opening up a non steam program then there's no reason to leave game mode, if you need to open non steam programs to do something (including any kind of file explorer) then (edit: ~~gaming~~ desktop mode) is the way you want to go.

Personally I think desktop mode without peripherals is fine, totally serviceable, if you just need to pop over to desktop to do some quick tinkering.",SteamDeck

The only real time i HAD to have a keyboard is when i used a usb drive with smokeless ui to access hidden parts of the steam decks bios to do an undervolt before trips and an overclock when I dont need long battery life. This takes me about 30 seconds to do now that i know my decks limits. Fun thing is on undervolt in re4 remake capped at 30fps i get an extra 20 to 30 minutes of battery compared to stock. On overclock my deck went from 40fps in cyberpunk to a near locked 60 too...granted battery doesnt last more than roughly 50 minutes buuuut lol.

Regardless, those are the only two things i needed a keyboard for. Anything else is 100% serviceable with the stock deck controls.",SteamDeck

Workaround you can do for that is creating a folder for each sd card on steam and put game into that. Then every time you download a game in a specific sd card you will have a group for that sd card.

I‚Äôm so glad I did because I now have one and it‚Äôs a major game changer for me. I used to love playing WoW several years ago. And I had to stop because you know, life does that to you sometimes. I couldn‚Äôt dedicate the time to sit down and play at my pc. But now I can take my steam deck anywhere with me, kick on my hotspot and play WoW wherever.

Maddeningly, I explained to my wife a few times that my main reason for getting it wasn't to ""main"" the device, but rather to keep as an emergency option for times where I couldn't use my pc e.g. (and I literally used this as an example) if we ever had to go into hospital for extended periods of time.

jhjeac1,"Similar. I saw the advert for it the day it was officially announced not realising you could put the deposit down until 24 hours later. When I realised, I was gutted but my deposit went down immediately (512GB) and from that day forth, never purchased another Switch game again (or any other game for that matter and focused on building up my Steam library). Sadly, I have an obsessive personality and the wait to actually hold my own in my hands, nearly drove me insane; it felt all consuming and for a year, all I did was consume every snippet of info from every source I could find to keep me going until I got it! I genuinely HATED the wait. I wanted to be one of the first. Call it FOMO, whatever. Anyhow, it was a year to the day ordered when mine finally arrived and it was and is everything I wanted and hoped it would and could be. I love it. The hype here, was fucking crazy. In my mind, it was the one device to rule them all and the trackpads were a deal maker for me. Could it be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô - of course, better screen, better battery and what not -  but does it need to be right now? To me, not at all. My money will be down for a Deck 2 instantly. No hesitation. 

I have many, many other consoles (retro gamer here) and I still have my Switch, my Vita, my Series X and a ¬£4k PC upstairs with a G9 (not flexing at all, I just do) and yet my Steam Deck is my go to. The ease, the convenience, the experience and equally my experience with Valve and the hardware itself has been flawless. Not one problem. 

I‚Äôve customised it with Decky, skinned it, upgraded it (512GB to 2TB) have a 1TB card in it and it‚Äôs used daily. It is MY deck! Currently tidying up all my emulators etc. and the list goes on.

There's also that game which you wouldn't forget even if you only play it for like, once a week or month even. That's Dead Cells for me.

There's also that game where you come back to once a year when a new big update comes in. That's Terraria for me.

Another is a game where you spend most of the time modding, only to play it for a few minutes and comes back again after a week or month. Skyrim and Minecraft.

In regards to your point, indeed. Why is that I somehow do not have the motivation to ""finish"" a game, whether it is story-wise or completion. Especially in open world games, I just play the story for a bit then just loiter around or do side ones.",SteamDeck

The second one is more casual and portable, something I don't have to worry about if I put down for months. This is currently Mario Bowser's fury.

And the last one is completely nonlinear without a narrative. A game just to be a game and can be rotated out for any other games in that pool, mainly meant to just be a past time or if only have like a 20-30 minute gap to game real quick.

If it is a 64gb or 256gb, you could try using an automotive rubbing compound such as ScratchX, however I do not think that is going to help here because most mild abbrasives are not going to remove a scratch from a glass screen.   


Cerium oxide is something that I have heard can be used to remove scratches from glass, but keep in mind that it is a messy process and you could end up causing a warping / halo effect if you dont remove an equal level of glass across the board. You also may introduce other smaller scratches and imperfections during the process.  


With all of this said, the best thing you can probably do is to buy a screen protector and place it on top. The adhesive may help fill in some of the gaps from the scratch and will thus reduce the visual impact it has.

If you want to go down that road it is possible to do more. The safest bet would be to increase the max boost clock on the CPU by 100-200mhz, keep the TDP the same etc, then when you have GPU clocks lowered it will be able to boost higher.

However let me point out again that doing such things is at your own risk, and especially if you undervolt there is a severe chance to brick your deck, the above said, it definitely **is** possible to bump up CPU performance a bit, the main risk is from increasing TDP/Temps or from undervolting.

Explore other things first and enjoy it how it is, if you get to a point where you really really want more out of it and are willing to take the risk, start out small like above and see if it helps, and don't get greedy, thats when things go wrong.",SteamDeck

jhk6iew,">Have you considered using another input for menu navigation instead? Left joystick, touchscreen, or even an otherwise unused left trackpad.

Yeah, in case with Risk of Rain 2 I use the left joystick + shoulder buttons instead for menus. But it then gets problematic when I like to (for example) open the player tab menu to hover over items with the cursor.

Since I use ""as joystick"" for the right joystick + gyro action on joystick touch (but without trackpad), the cursor is also too fast there. In some other games, the matter gets even hairier unfortunately. But I used Risk of Rain 2 as an example here.

I had seen that a workaround can be to create an action layer for this that I toggle with a button press. But before I do that (and making my configs too complex), I got really curious if there is perhaps a way to solve this at its root.

And if there sadly isn't, if there is a convenient alternative that I haven't thought of. What would you suggest as a binding here?

>a menu action set to activate **on cursor detection**

That's what systemd units are for. It shoudn't break anything, unless Valve makes some big changes (I'm not even sure what kind of changes might break it tbh), and even then, all your data should be safe in `/home/nix`. I have it on my deck for at least 2 major updates while switching between channels and it works as intended.

>And the article even explicitly points out that this is a prototype they're testing out to see how stable that kind of install is

That's not what was stated in article though. Installer is a prototype, not the method itself. Creating `/nix` and mounting `/home/nix` to `/nix` are pretty simple tasks that is hard to fuck up.",SteamDeck

jhikia5,"About a week ago I started having the same issue.

Turns out my Steam Deck killed my 1TB Sandisk SD card (not fake, bought 6 months ago). It put the SD card it in a weird state of read-only where it looks like I can uninstall things or move them, but as soon as I reset the Steam Deck, everything goes back as it was before. This also made the downloads freeze and all the rest of the things you described. I only realized after I removed the SD card and everything started working correctly again.

I put another SD card, one that I have been using with my Switch for 2 years now, at first it worked okay, but then my Deck started doing the same thing again. That one, luckily I was able to save.

Is the theory that the thermal pad is restricting airflow to the Steam Deck's fan intake?

**To be clear: I am not questioning whether this is a problem** as much as I'm looking to be able to objectively measure the effect and the potency of workarounds.

So I did the regular fix for this which is going into the game's settings in yuzu, tabbing to the advanced graphics section, and changing accuracy level to high. For a lot of games on deck this will turn the game into a slow motion slog though. This is where powertools comes in handy, by turning off SMT this majorly improved performance and got the game to run normally again.

I'm no expert so I can't give you a detailed explanation or tell you why this helps, but it does help. And it helps other games too, from what I've heard. I'm pretty sure this fix works for all games on yuzu that have particle effect problems.",SteamDeck

jhkhwjl,OBJECTION!,SteamDeck
jhb96mk,I remember really enjoying this game on PS3 and was disappointed it never continued on. Never played the expansion as I had finished the game and long moved on. I think it's $2 CDN currently on Steam so there's no going wrong with that choice.,SteamDeck
jhbqlc9,"Man, I'm seeing a lot of hate for this game here. This game had a particular rhythm and flow, and even combat (the small encounters) took 10 seconds max to finish if you know what you are doing.

I've heard this game's flow mimics the original PoP, and I know a ton of the current fanbase started with the trilogy during the GC/PS2/XBox era.",SteamDeck
jhbpy0u,"Such an amazing game. The story, the visuals and characters are all brilliant.",SteamDeck
jhbqg2y,Hidden gem of a game right here,SteamDeck

I personally didn't feel like it was anymore or less repetitive than the previous trilogy. 

Definitely wish we'd get more in this style.",SteamDeck

jhbtxq6,I remember holding the first game so high that when this came out I was in happy. Then I beat the game like 5 times ü§£ I literally just watched the movie a few nights ago too. I had also named my old car Elika. My favorite car I ever had 01 is300,SteamDeck

jhcwp68,"Cool choice, I know this one wasn't really loved by the community, but I really liked it as a chill, parkour style game with little consequence, super fun finding every corner of the map, cool visuals üëç gonna have to load this on the deck soon, thanks for reminding me about this one ‚úåÔ∏è",SteamDeck
jhd6ly7,Wish the twats at Ubishit would add achievement to support to all of the PoP games. I need an excuse to go back and play through them again but I have so much in my backlog that I wouldn't bother otherwise.,SteamDeck
jhdccqo,This was 08? Dang graphics wise this looks pretty good.,SteamDeck
jhddr7h,"I remember this game was harshly criticised for placing you where you were right after a death so not punishing you for dying took away consequence and lowered the stakes, but now it's such a common practice I noticed it in games like it takes two or Jedi fallen order while I personally think this makes combat and platforming less thrilling it allows people with little time to ""git gud"" to enjoy gaming anyway so in a way this game was so ahead of its time",SteamDeck
jhdetxw,How did you get this working? I wasn‚Äôt able to get it to launch last time I bought it.,SteamDeck
jhdf775,"Thanks bro, I‚Äôm gonna play this now",SteamDeck
jhdghan,I had so much fun with this when it came out then it just ended. Only years after i found out the ending was dlc...,SteamDeck

hopefully they've improved :\]",SteamDeck
jhdjckc,"Loved this game. Great characters, Prince and Elika, with nice interactions through dialogue and especially animations. Wish PC got the DLC and I'd pick it back up for another go. Though the DLC left it on an even larger cliffhanger.",SteamDeck
jhdjzez,Which version is this,SteamDeck
jhdnzgk,Wow that was a great game!,SteamDeck
jhdutpk,Bought it haha. Never played this one. Looks nice though!,SteamDeck
jhdxxwe,Just grabbed this for ¬£1.74!!! Bar-fuckin-gin.,SteamDeck
jhe3cpd,Looks amazing,SteamDeck
jheae21,"I should give this another try.  I remember being disappointed when it came out.  If I'm remembering correctly, the things I didn't like were the complete lack of any sort of character progression and the fact that if you died you would respawn in the same spot like nothing happened.  This made it hard for me to stay motivated to keep playing it",SteamDeck
jhei956,Upvoted just for putting the name of the game in your title! So sick of the 'out of context screenshot and inside joke title' post formula.,SteamDeck
jhgmdk7,Remember playing this on 360. I never finished it been  meaning to play this again since it's in my library.,SteamDeck
jhbgtn2,How are the PoP games on the deck btw? I got them a while back haven't touched them.,SteamDeck
jhbymv8,"Maybe this game didn't have a great combat system but the cell shading implementation is still one of the best I've seen and holds up even today.

Maybe if it wasn't called prince of persia it wouldn't have that much hate. I still think it was a fun game, had a great time.",SteamDeck
jhc2nbq,I am prince of persia fans. But playinh this game...i can't finish it. Feels like different game..,SteamDeck
jhc6riu,"I couldn't get into this on Deck. It was showing Keyboard icons instead of controller icons, so I couldn't figure out how to do basic moves and didn't have the patience for trial and error.",SteamDeck
jhbeo9f,I didnt like this game the trilogy where way better.,SteamDeck
jhbi4pi,The game looked incredible but the gameplay was so bad compared to the trilogy,SteamDeck
jhccol3,This game is so underrated,SteamDeck
jhbpfq6,This is one of those games that if it got true sequel it could have turned into something special. It really needed a second chance.,SteamDeck

jhd219e,Why are you playing the worst one?,SteamDeck
jhbtzo8,"I was so excited for this game after Sands of Time, so I was so sad when it sucked.",SteamDeck
jhe9bnm,"I hate these "" **Never thought I could ever revisit this on a handheld** "". It's a 2008 game, technology advances. Laptops get better and better why is it such a mind block to think handhelds will one day reach this level or even better.

A decade from now we could very highly play games like RDR2 at max on a handheld.

Looks great though",SteamDeck
jhbncid,Reminds me I need to look for hitman,SteamDeck
jhbqyus,I thought I would hate this game after playing thr SOT trilogy but wow it was so good. I recently got it on sale for both Steam and Ubisoft. I should play it again.,SteamDeck
jhbr8gb,"Glad I bought all of them. Since I played them out of order on multiple game systems (PSP, Xbox360). Ready to buy a steam deck and install all of these!",SteamDeck

jhbsrhb,This type of thing is the absolute best purpose for this system!,SteamDeck

jhbtuau,"One of the first games I booted up on SD. I totally get the sentiment that it was a disappointment after the SOT trilogy‚Ä¶ but once you get past that it‚Äôs it‚Äôs own thing, and you just get into the flow of the rhythm based platforming and lightseed collection, it‚Äôs wonderful. I would have loved a direct sequel.",SteamDeck
jhbu18u,"I still remember when I could not beat one of the bosses, because it had QTE scene of mashing space button, but for some reason my PC or keyboard made it insanely more difficult to complete that QTE.

Still very cool game, maybe worse, but the only PoP that I have fully finished.",SteamDeck

jhd2fme,"I just beat Sands of Time as my first game on deck! Downloaded this and the rest of the Prince of Persia games.

That‚Äôs what I love about the deck. I probably wouldn‚Äôt sit at my desk to play games like this, especially since I spend all day working there, but an hour or 2 laying in bed is perfect for these games",SteamDeck
jhd6yxo,I'll never forget seeing the trailer on TV with the Sigur Ros song - one of my favourite game trailers ever - it inspired me to go out and buy the game day 1. Loved every minute. Always thought it was severely underrated.,SteamDeck
jhd7fkr,damn i wish i could prioritize gaming now. if this shit existed when i was a kid...,SteamDeck
jhdd6qf,I enjoyed it back when it was new..  the controls on steamdeck drive me up the wall!,SteamDeck
jhefvqg,"I love the everything about this game, except the gameplay. It‚Äôs sooo boooring

But the art style is top tier",SteamDeck
jhehn9s,"Completely forgot this game existed, I remember first playing it when I was 10 and I didn't really like it, maybe I'll try it again at 24 to see if I was right or wrong",SteamDeck
jhfm5wg,Was this the one that you couldn‚Äôt die in,SteamDeck
jhg2l2f,That game was a huge let down for me after the first 3. I can still feel the disappointment.,SteamDeck
jhgxgqs,Ah yeees. The memories. Thanks good sir for sharing this. Time to relive the memories.,SteamDeck
jhh7ddo,"Seemed like a good game but after coming into it expecting another SoT style game I was let down and never finished it, I just picked it up on the steam sale so I could try it out again",SteamDeck
jhjymju,My take on this game's ending has evolved as I have gotten older. It serves as a means of self reflection and that really surprises me.,SteamDeck
jhbz4es,"coming from the SoT trilogy, this was a major letdown",SteamDeck
jhd0ra8,Do you know if the Steam version comes with the Epilogue DLC that was released on consoles?,SteamDeck
jhbxvzf,"When you say ""The game's flow mimics the original PoP"" which original are we talking about?",SteamDeck
jhcu5aa,"Yeah. This was the only PoP i finished. The game had something special, almost mythical. I liked it.",SteamDeck
jhdhfzb,Just not very challenging I thought.,SteamDeck
jhbuhom,"As already mentioned, emulating the original is probably a better experience.",SteamDeck
jhfqe23,"No it works!
You just have to select a layout that represents a controller and then reboot the game. There is one pretty high up in the community layouts.  

By default a layout with KB + M is selected so the game thinks that these are connected.  
When launching with a controller layout it immediately recognizes it.",SteamDeck
jhc2pw1,idk I loved that game. It felt so unique and different. Also loved the story. Spoiler: >!loved that it had the exact same ending The Last of Us would have years later!<.,SteamDeck
jhjyxt9,Repetition and encounter variety go hand in hand. I love this game but it had a huge encounter variety problem that the SOT series did not.,SteamDeck
jhjz0iz,Really confused as to why folks are talking about a sequel. Didn't the ending essentially close the door on that?,SteamDeck
jhdac8s,"My favorite PoP game. Has a chill, indie feeling vibe.",SteamDeck
jhcrp57,I‚Äôm enjoying it,SteamDeck
jhca405,"IMO, no. I bought it on sale back in the day and kinda regretted it. It excels at nothing really and the fact that *you just can't die* is a huge dealbreaker for me, there's no stakes in the game. Also, if memory serves me well, the ending was somewhat incomplete and you needed DLC to get more out of it, but I never went to buy as I was quite broke back then.

This said, I see a lot of people in this thread saying they like the game as some kind of hidden gem. To each their own, but that sounds crazy to me. I do agree it could had used a properly made sequel, though.",SteamDeck
jhcrobh,Steam,SteamDeck
jhdaadu,Same! I loved the water color looking art style and the chill vibe of the game.,SteamDeck
jhda8io,"Same. I want to play through the PoP, Far Cry, and Watch Dog games, but no achievements.",SteamDeck
jhbt0fm,"I don't like the steam editions. They weren't good ports for PC at the time and I don't think they work particularly well now, even with the controls.

I've been emulating the PS2 versions and those seem to work pretty well for me.",SteamDeck
jhbmghe,I've played the first of the trilogy and there's a bit of jank but plays well enough with some tinkering. The PC port isn't nearly as optimal and/or as seamless as you would hope for.,SteamDeck
jhcd7mc,You'd be better off emulating the PS2 or Gamecube versions of them. Fantastic trilogy though.,SteamDeck
jhc7zdv,Never finished it either. Felt weird.,SteamDeck
jhbiis5,"I remember this one was very repetitive, but the female companion and her interactions with the prince were amazing.",SteamDeck
jhcsro7,This one *was* a reboot.,SteamDeck
jhc6cco,It's a completely different game really. Would have been better to name it something else. I enjoyed it for what it was.,SteamDeck
jhf58ou,"You bastards, I totally was burning through my backlog of games I hadn't played and now I've got to pause that to replay the SoT games.",SteamDeck
jhcmj69,"Why was that? Because of the lighter tone and the different combat?

I was very young when I played the SoT triology but I felt the same way about POP 2008 and I'm not really sure why.",SteamDeck
jhcnaz3,"An extremely big let down, they should‚Äôve pushed this out as a different series",SteamDeck
jhdfsvd,Unfortunately I think that was only ever released on consoles.,SteamDeck
jhc065l,I dont think they mean the 1989 original :d,SteamDeck
jhdixo8,I like a not so challenging game from time to time. This game is art!,SteamDeck
jhfwrhc,Oh really? This didn't work last time I tried it! Do the button prompts change to Xbox icons?,SteamDeck
jhcd2rl,"The biggest problem was lack of tension. Without the consequences of death and failure the platforming mechanics lost a bit of excitement and depth. I didn‚Äôt play the whole thing so I don‚Äôt know if that persists the whole game. If they did do a bait and switch and made it so later on you lose the safety net that would have been cool, but I didn‚Äôt make it that far.",SteamDeck
jhk0ft0,"No. Elika has to sacrifice herself in order to seal Ahriman away... but you end up going back and undoing everything you did in the game to save her, and letting him out in the process. 

And even though the epilogue DLC has you ""kill"" Ahriman, he ultimately survives and is bloodthirsty for revenge against the prince while Elika leaves to try and find her people. 

Leaving it wide open to a sequel without Elika and having to deal with Ahriman alone.",SteamDeck
jhcuojr,The DLC hedges the ending and ruins something that was legit unique in games at the time. It was The Last of Us‚Äô ending before The Last of Us. Big emotional gut punch. One of my all-time favorites.,SteamDeck
jhdbu62,And the controls are working fine for you as other mentioned they have trouble getting it to work properly?,SteamDeck
jhd9ghy,Thank you!,SteamDeck
jhbq9vg,Repetitive?,SteamDeck
jhcqh2j,I couldn't stand how she saves you from failure. Completely broke the flow and satisfaction of longer platforming sections if it just revives you back to the last failed jump. Would have preferred the option to disable it in favor of old school checkpoints.,SteamDeck
jhcm7i1,This game is available on your phone.,SteamDeck
jhh5xhi,"i cant get it to run, keeps saying that the processor isnt supported and ive been told that the steam port is buggy as hell :(",SteamDeck
jhd4f9k,"very different combat, story wasnt the greatest either, there wasnt much to loose (risk/reward), etc. SoT had a nice theme to it, prince evolved as a character, the dark prince was an interesting dynamic as well with his health and need for sands etc",SteamDeck
jhc6u32,"The 1989 PoP is firmly engrained in my mind from my childhood... So hard for me I never got close to passing the first level, still loved it",SteamDeck
jhc8a5j,"Well, yes. The one on one combat encounters which amount to attack, and usually a defensive measure(parry of some sort of in 2008's case parry and jump function), timed and rhythmic jumping sections. Both combat and the parkour aspect are very rhythmic. You can't just brute force your way through it.

The 2008 game, while a lot easier than the original (and not dependent on beating the game in a certain time), is really harkening back to the original game. The Sands of Time Trilogy still has a lot of aspects but is way more third person adventure-y and much more inspired from PoP3D",SteamDeck
jhdlcv2,I didn‚Äôt like that one I was about 4 although I was fine with games like double dragon I didn‚Äôt like blood in video games in fact I actively looked for out blood less or virtually bloodless games until I was about 17 or 18.,SteamDeck
jhg1n2f,Yes they do. Worked without issues for me,SteamDeck
jhci1fh,the controls aren‚Äôt as tight as you remember. the autosave/death tele was pretty necessary to keep flow and fairness,SteamDeck
jhdw518,"You have the same exact consequences for failing than you did in the Sand of Times trilogy: you respawn at the last checkpoint.

Oh, except 2008 Prince of Persia is harder cause you can't just rewind time a few seconds if you didn't time a jump correctly.",SteamDeck
jhhtb92,"They work fine. You have to manually select a Steam control layout with controller inputs and restart the game.  
The game somehow defaults to a Keyboard & Mouse layout, and believes no controller is connected. Once a controller layout is selected it switches to controller inputs.",SteamDeck
jhbrsys,"I played it a really long time ago, but from my memory it felt like all the bosses were the same? Plus no time manipulation like in the trilogy.",SteamDeck
jhdvjte,I don't get how this is relevant to his comment,SteamDeck
jhdo56i,"This right here. SoT Prince had a great story arc, fantastic, voice acting and overall the story felt more visceral and tangible even. The graphical style of PoP 2008 gave it a very surreal feel and nothing had any consequence because Elika could save you from every mistake.

That said I did enjoy the 2008 version enough in it's own way. Warrior Within for me was probably my favourite.",SteamDeck
jhdcpam,Haha it was exactly the same for me! I ended up just watching my dad play.,SteamDeck
jhfnbgp,The game that kept me coming back to Radio Shack just to get a taste.,SteamDeck
jhdcm8m,"Thank you for the explanation, i see what u mean now :)",SteamDeck
jhg56yr,"You're right, it works perfectly! Thanks for the heads up",SteamDeck
jhdorca,Then that‚Äôs a bigger problem with the game. They should have baked it longer if was under done. Especially since the previous three were so good.,SteamDeck
jhdx72c,It isn‚Äôt exactly the same. You have a limited number of times you can try that jump and then you get respawned. It felt like a better balance between the two extremes of punishing and hand holding.,SteamDeck
jhbts3n,"Yeah but the time mechanic started with the trilogy, not the series as a whole",SteamDeck
jhevwkw,"i agree, that is sorta my point. if you think the autosave is the worst part, you haven‚Äôt played it recently. that‚Äôs a welcome bandaid to make it all work.",SteamDeck

jhi6o3j,"Some immediate thoughts:

- Does the right trackpad work fine in most games you play? It's worth checking to eliminate the chance that the hardware is at fault.

- How have you set up Heroic? Do you add games to SteamOS' game mode with Heroic's option to do that, or do you have a single entry where you load Heroic and then load a game on top of it? My line of thinking is that if it's the latter, and that both is loaded, something in the control scheme is interacting with Heroic, pulling that input away from the game.

Lastly, more of a tip: if you want an official controller profile for a non-steam game that's on Steam, you can change the game's name temporarily to the numerical ID it's registered under (in Darkest Dungeon's case, it's 262060). When you do that, it'll look at controller profiles under 262060, which in turn will be the profiles for the game that you can save before changing the name back. Handy for Doom mods!",SteamDeck

I didn't use the steam deck a lot. The trackpad always works in Desktop mode, and it worked fine in DeskJob. When it was not working in Darkest Dungeon, after closing the game it was working again. So I suppose it is not an hardware issue

I go to Desktop mode, launch heroic and execute the game from there. When I go home I will try the other setup. Many thanks!

Star Wars squadron runs really well on it and it‚Äôs fun seeing Star Wars fans light up when they see it. Just today I had one person who was worried about the weight but felt the weight (when I had their expensive watch as collateral) and they are always shocked. I always have fun explaining how my game library is a decade plus old compared to newer consoles that typically are at the mercy of a narrow game library or waiting for backward compatible games or 4K rereleases. 



Just as a side note I also play solo player board games or read comic books or books which usually gets the customers attention and opens them for a quick convo.

I look over at him in horror as he whips it out... ""Ohhhh a White PS Vita. No I don't want to hold it."". He looked sad, stopped jerking off, and went on his way.

But then it felt that people were scowling at me as they walked by. Sure enough, I started to hear whispers and murmering beneath their breath as they walked by. 

Finally, I had to ask my brother why people were so freaked out by someone using a handheld device to play video games simply because it's not on a Nintendo product. 

My brother simply shook his head and said, ""Robert ... we're Amish."" So now I play with my Deck under a blanket in the barn late at night, to hide my shame from God.

jhbyw57,"Yeah my PSP Go is the handheld that actually goes out in the wild with me.  Way more pocketable and works perfectly for waiting room gaming or waiting in line quick bursts.  The slider sleep function is almost perfect.

Steamdeck is more for allowing me to game at home and not be tethered to a certain room or chair.  I have a massive Big Joe bean bag in my living room and it's so wonderful to come home on my lunch break and just chill on there and game.  Also I'm getting older and having some issues with neck pain so sitting and staring at a TV causes alot of issues.   The Deck allows me to get in the most comfortable position and game out.  

The Deck to me is like having a hardbound book.  I prefer it but I wouldn't carry it around in public to read, I would bring a paperback.

Apart from that, there‚Äôs no situation when I would be in public with enough spare time. Maybe a really long train ride and probably wait times, but realistically I‚Äôm behind the wheel of a car anyways and I think it‚Äôs frowned upon if I play games while driving :‚ÄòD",SteamDeck

I‚Äôve taken it on a few trips because I‚Äôm really attached to it but I suppose the deck is my couch and bedtime portable mainly.
I can understand feeling weird pulling it out.",SteamDeck
jhcc3zh,"I'm not self conscious at all about that, but I don't really have an urge to take it outside my house either. If I'm at a bar, at the beach or whatever, I wanna be focusing on  those experiences rather than the ones I could have at home. Even on a bus I'd rather be looking out the window, taking in my surroundings. The Steam Deck does it's job by freeing my games library from my desk, but I don't really need it to follow me outside my house. Sometimes, you just gotta touch grass.",SteamDeck
jhcc820,I personally only use it in public on the train. But simply because that's the only public setting in which I spend enough time doing nothing and sitting comfortably enough to bring it out and get into a game,SteamDeck

jhccn4l,"Back when I worked for a hospital in NYC, I would play my Deck on the commute in the NJ transit bus to Port Authority. It was very comfortable and allowed me to enjoy my commute. 
If you are worried about people, I can only tell you from my experience in NJ, since nothing ever happens around where I lived. 

Had one guy get excited that I had the deck. Watched me play Rayman 2 on the n64 emulator. 
Another watched me play Yakuza 0. 

Only place I never played was in my other half of the commute in NYC subways. I am sure you can picture why.",SteamDeck

I wouldn't bring it to a restaurant or bar tho but that's not a self conscious thing, it's a ""I don't have room on this table and my phone is good enough until my food arrives"" thing. I'll play it no problem at all in airports, planes, buses, trains, etc.",SteamDeck
jhcdl7y,"Don‚Äôt let other people dictate what you can or can‚Äôt do dude. If you want to play your steam deck, do it. I bet more people than you think wish they could just game wherever they want

jhce5n3,Only reason I don‚Äôt play out in public is I can‚Äôt focus enough on the game at hand. I did however take it to the doctors office because I knew I would be waiting a while and that sure was nice. My favorite place to take it is on the pooper,SteamDeck

jhchwlj,"Yup, I feel odd about my switch lite too though. I'm generally pretty self conscious about that stuff and I don't want to be a target for thieves. Come to think of it I even feel self conscious playing Iphone games in public.",SteamDeck
jhci9pa,"Well, I rarely brought my switch with me to places. Even doctor offices.

So increase the price and size? Even less. I only bring it if I'm visiting close family so I have something to do if there's a lull. But even then it's rare.",SteamDeck
jhcidn8,"Problem is, whenever I go out, I'm hanging with someone. I never take it out to play because I'd rather socialize.",SteamDeck
jhcikuu,"Yeah at first, i was like this due to the size of SD, but after playing multiple times in the cafe area, it was actually therapeutic and made my coffee last. Also, the charger port is a bonus.",SteamDeck
jhciol1,"It‚Äôs hit or miss depending on where you are, like today I‚Äôm sat at the airport waiting to travel home and the Deck has been a god send to while away the hours waiting. However, airports tend to have better security than being sat in a pub, plus when I game I loose all focus at what‚Äôs happening around me. So I‚Äôd feel really unsafe. So perfect for commutes and travelling but not so much for day to day stuff.",SteamDeck
jhcivsa,Yes and no sometimes I‚Äôll be really in an intense fight and people come up asking questions and me not trying to be rude answer.,SteamDeck
jhciyte,"Steam deck got me through jury selection.   6 hrs locked in a room with 125 people.   Only have access to a bathroom and a water fountain.   Vampire survivors, and emulated paper mario ftw!    Sat near a plugin, but never needed it.   I didn't end up being selected.   I was kinda lookn forward to days of hanging around the court house lol.   Murder trial woulda actually been interesting.

Edit, first time it went further than my deck",SteamDeck
jhcj3iv,"I‚Äôd play it on a plane, a train, or a hotel lobby, but a bar is a dumb idea, you go to a bar to socialize. The idea of going to any place where you are supposed to socialize or talk to others feels very weird and kind of rude to me. Like imagine a waiter coming up to you while playing at a restaurant and you being in the middle of a game you can‚Äôt pause, that feels so gross to me. But also I don‚Äôt really like going out alone either, going to a bar by myself personally feels weird, even though I know it‚Äôs not that strange.",SteamDeck
jhcj66o,I play it at work and had my manager help me on something In metal gear solid one. It's extremely uncomfortable to play games on public without sound tho.,SteamDeck
jhcj8cs,"I love it, I bring it out as much as I can just to have on me in the event I am by myself and need something to play. A lot of time people would ask me what it is then we get into discussion about handheld device and is capabilities",SteamDeck
jhcj9s5,"If I‚Äôm waiting a while at an appointment I‚Äôll take it. For example I was at my dealership getting an oil change and played it for quite a bit. Even had a guy (with a pregnant wife) walk by and ask me if it was a SD.

I don‚Äôt rely on mass transit but if I did I imagine I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable playing it on any bus or subway.",SteamDeck

jhckipw,I'm not a nice person period so I don't get approached period. If I'm playing my steam deck and I see a shadow approach me I'll fight first. I travel with a blade and gun so fuck the bs. I play steam deck in public cuz I hate people,SteamDeck
jhckk77,"I guess it depends? Like I'm not going to go out with friends and bring it that's crazy.

But like if I'm going to a doctor's appointment or on the train, plane, or in any scenario where I'm going to be waiting by myself for a significant amount of time, I'll consider bringing it.

I brought it to the DMV a while back and played 
 ""Man Eater"" for an hour while I waited for my number to get called that was pretty dope.",SteamDeck

Idgaf how manly or growed up the game is lmao",SteamDeck
jhclfjb,I totally use it in a plane. I am even happy thinking that I can spend a few our in a plane doing nothing but planning on my steam deck. I don't take it with me to public transport but just because it's a bit too big. I normally take smaller devices with me like the miyoo mini or the retroid pocket. But I don't care about people.,SteamDeck
jhcljjb,"I play at work on my lunch break. One of my coworkers gave me shit for being a ‚Äúgrown man playing kids games‚Äù. He is a miserable guy who always complains about life in general. I used to let the opinions of other people weigh on me more, now I enjoy what I like.",SteamDeck

jhcngy5,"nah, I'm kinda known for it at my school; if I'm done working in class I'm either sleeping or playing on my steam deck lol.  most people just think it's a switch tho.  I even did a test on it once when my laptop died in last period.  one of the school admins saw me playing it and asked me what it was, I explained that it was basically a switch but runs PC games and he said he thought he heard his kid talking about it but couldn't remember what it was.  we talked a bit more about it.  then some time in January he saw me again and thanked me, he said he ended up buying his kid one for Christmas

so I guess if you're like openly nerdy you're fine.  if you don't want to look like a nerd then maybe not, but also if you don't then why do you have a deck :)",SteamDeck
jhcnus1,"My game sessions, when I can make the time, are ideally like two to three hours. I like to get really immersed in the games I'm playing, and can't really do that on the move, er in public.

jhcqo4r,Heck no! I don't care about playing in public. but only if I know wherever I'm going I'm gonna be sitting or waiting for a while. I love portable gaming more than console systems. and in a pinch If I don't have my deck with me.

jhcude0,"Not particularly.

There are places where it feels inappropriate to me, but those are about the nature of that specific place, not about being in public. Say, a nice restaurant or a funeral.

Solo eating restaurant - yes. 
Public transit, yes.
Pedicure salon, hell yes
Park - yes

Id think the steam deck is more accepted in a airport or public transportation.,SteamDeck
jhcyzpw,"I am in the same boat, the thought of whipping out my huge Deck in thr public makes me self-conscious, but I also noticed that literally nobody cares...

The other time I'm pretty sure that when the dude started eying my Deck he immediately shared that with someone on his phone. But yeah other than that, zero interaction, I just gotta force myself to use logic that someone might look if I take out my Deck in the public but not much else will happen.

The only time I'd bring my Steamy Deck is if I'm spending time waiting in my car for possibly hours or lengthy commutes via aircraft, etc.  I have to put it away when children are nearby -- most parents do a good job on keeping their kids on a leash, but I'm not chancing the possibility of having a child stare at my screen and asking if they can play it.

He didnt stick around for answers for more than 20 seconds, I could have told him everything he wanted to know, but I guess this was the first time he saw a mythical machine out in the wild and he seemed quite intimidated trying to speak english to a random person.

jhe3spt,"I'm passed caring and being ashamed of being a gamer. 

I used to feel embarrassed about being a gamer because of the criticism I received from my dad, my brother, and even my ex. But as I got older, I realized that I am proud of who I am and what I have accomplished. Despite coming from a difficult background, I have built a good life for myself through hard work and perseverance

Look here, young and old alike:
Gaming has always been my way of decompressing and having fun, especially during the tough times. Nowadays, as a well-of and good-looking 33-year-old with a beautiful girlfriend and a 1-year-old son, I don't have much free time. But when I do, I still love playing video games on my Steam deck, whether I'm at home or on the go. 

My dad smacked the shit out of us and my mum. He never seemed ashamed of who he was. So many reasons exist to be ashamed in this life and all those people doing bad things live their life without batting an eye.

I left home as soon as I could with not a cent to my name. I was couch surfing until I could afford a place. I had to study and work to sustain myself. Gaming was the thing I did for so many years to have fun and enjoy myself. It was cheap accessible I could do it right there at home. 

A couple of weeks ago I sat in front of this cute woman on the train and noticed her looking at me. I sat and said ""hello"" she looked quite interested as while I was sitting, taking my jacket off and stuff I noticed her looking at me a couple more times. Me, I had a one hour trip and the aforementioned beautiful girlfriend at home... It flatters me but this is my ""me time"". I took my SD and began playing Bannerlord. (I used to play warband on the shitiest laptop back in the day :D). Now...If you could imagine how shocked that woman looked. I felt her judging me sooo much. I'm happy I'm no longer with a girl like that.

It actually made me smile right then and there looking at my screen for a while. Reminded me of all these posts I saw here on reddit of people feeling uncomfortable playing in public. I see why, but their judging eyes won't make me ashamed. Such a small and superficial thing. It's our hobby... Geez. 

Gaming doesn't make you lazy or immature - it's just a hobby that you happen to be passionate about.

So, if you're a gamer like me, don't be ashamed of who you are. It doesn't matter what other people think - what matters is that you enjoy what you do and that you are a good person.

If everybody‚Äôs in the bar has got purple or green hair, you‚Äôre good to go. If everyone looks like you‚Äôre grandmother and grandfather then maybe leave steamy at home. If you can see people golfing or skiing out the window, leave steamy at home. I hope this helps.",SteamDeck

2) A steam backpack. You know the type there are hundreds of them. I use this when I go places and know I will end up with my hands full. Situations like returning home from grocery shopping. Also allows me to take my charger and battery pack with me.

3) The original Steam Deck case. The scenario I use this one for is one in which I never plan on using the original case again, so it just gets stashed in a drawer. Which is an everyday scenario. I will give Valve lots of love for giving us a free case, even if I never use it NONE of the other handheld manufacturers will do that.",SteamDeck

Moreover, you can't flash new things to a phone unless the owner went out of their way to unlock the bootloader. Unlockable bootloader does NOT mean unlocked out of the box. USB debugging is also not available out of the box, and even if it WAS you still need to get past the lock screen to access an android phone via ADB on an unregistered computer.

First, you're conflating two very different things, you can factory reset an android phone from any recovery mode, it wipes the phone of all data. Most of these are even managed by the device distributors themselves, there are plenty of phones including pixels that can just be reset even on [Android 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5no9BbqP65w). If you just want to sell or pawn the phone, this is the best route, many shady pawn stores will also just take the phone locked and just give people less money and factory reset themselves.

The US Government did not want to just factory reset the phone to sell it, they wanted to recover data from the phone to preserve evidence, which is a massive privacy violation. These things are not the same, at all. iPhones will just reset and wipe themselves, and the government didn't want this, because they wanted the data on the phone, and without the pin they couldn't get it.

Performance wise, you're looking at 15-30 depending on how many things are happening, generally around 25 for me.

I have bought a Bluetooth keyboard for desktop mode, so I could use it also for X4 I suppose üòÖ",SteamDeck
jhjxwnj,"Funny you mention this as I was just playing X4 and using it as my streaming test dummy.

1. So the gameplay is really fun now with plenty of content if you get the DLCs. It's also a bit more polished, but it's still an AA game, not an AAA game qualitywise.
2. Performance in the game is rough. I don't think it should've been verified. When you're just zooming around in space you can get a reasonable 30fps with the default settings. But that drops into the low 20s when you encounter a battle involving more than a couple ships, or when you walk around on a station. Even turning the settings down doesn't help tremendously much. Perversely, turning the settings lower actually makes it look better in some ways - the shadows and especially volumetric fog are kind of ugly on the Deck's small screen. But ultimately, I decided to uninstall X4 from my Deck and rely entirely on streaming via moonlight (which works amazingly) from my desktop to play it because the performance was just not great enough for my liking.
3. Once you get going it's super fun, but there's a hard learning curve and it can take awhile to get into. It's sort of like Privateer or Freelancer, if you were Lando Calrissian instead of Han Solo. Going from some hobo in a scout ship with nothing in your name to the owner of a space empire with fleets of capital ships and even your own sectors and stations is pretty cool.

The controls were a big concern for me too; I ended up having to use a community control config to get them the way I wanted. The main issue was commanding my empire from the map; it works much better when you set one of the touchpads to behave as a mouse for that part of the game. Otherwise the default controls are generally fine.",SteamDeck

jhf21jt,"Yeah, I think if the system was limited and the games were targeted for its hardware and had their settings locked down, like a Switch, the battery life wouldn't even be a complaint. The reason people complain is because the system *allows* them to crank things up, max out the hardware, and drain the battery in an hour and a half (or play games that wouldn't even be ported to it, due to high battery drain, if it was a regular console). The ability to do that is part of what makes the Deck *awesome*, but it also makes people more aware of a limitation that *would probably exist on the Switch too* if you could tweak the video settings for each game and crank things way up...

What compounds the issue, though, is that a lot of the bigger games *default* to trying to max out the system's capabilities. For example, when I installed Horizon Zero Dawn I was only getting an hour and a half out of it with the default settings, but I was easily able to get over 4 hours out of it after adjusting a few things. If the Deck was a regular console like the Switch, the devs would probably tune that game's settings for 3.5-4 hours of battery life, lock it down, and no one would ever experience that 1.5-hour low (and would also never experience the graphical fidelity those settings allow).  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",SteamDeck

jhhqlez,"Yeah, but I chose the control scheme in Game Mode before switching to Desktop Mode to play, and the hotkeys still didn‚Äôt work.

Being this much of a dismissive dick obviously comes very easy, I note.",SteamDeck
jhhrr1h,"I actually dont know that it would work in desktop mode. It might, but I dont know how... (actually while writing this - I remembered. see below)

So here is the deal.

Those back buttons (R4 in our case), arent ""xbox style controller buttons"". They are just ""ALIEN press thingies, that are not buttons at all, as far as pretty much any emulator and any program that would recognize an xbox controller"" is concerned.

So you need something ""early and powerfull"" to set those buttons meaning before they reach the emulator, and set them to keyboard inputs - which then the emulator can recognize, because all PC emulators know what a keyboard is. :)

That ""something early and powerfull"" is steam controller configuration. Which you normally should only touch in game mode. Why to follow soon.

For that you also need to have steam running all the time, otherwise no steam controller configuration active. (if you cant pull up the software keyboard, steam is not running - just as a fyi, because its controlled the same way)

Now there is an additional complication, and that is, that Desktop mode, puts another ""controller configuration"" SWITCH on top of that.

When you boot up into Desktop mode, it sets all the steam controller controls to a ""Mouse mode"", meaning, space, and enter, and ESC and mouse buttons are mapped, and the controller doesnt behave like a controller at all. But rather like a mouse.

You can switch that by pressing the start button (what on a PS3 controller would be a start button) for 3 seconds, then in desktop mode you get a popup, that gamecontroller mode was enabled, then the controller acts like an xbox controller -

with two exceptions - trackpads still behave like a mouse, and backbuttons arent mapped, because they arent part of a classic Xbox controller.

Now comes the fun part.

In Desktop mode, steam can not differenciate which window ""is active"" at a time, so does NO game controller profile switching, based on what programs you open.

And changing the stock mouse mode or gamepad mode configurations for desktop mode in steam, is strongly discouraged - because, if you mess up mouse mode... The easiest way to revert that for a large subsection of ""non technical"" people would be to install the OS again.

Thats why the ""only configure steam controller input overlay stuff in game mode"" is a hot tip we sometimes tell people.

Now - in game mode, controller profiles are switched to active, based on the steam shortcut you launch in game mode.

So if you have different shortcuts for citra and the actual games you want to play in citra (so if they show as different shortcuts), you would have to set it in both.

Long story short. Play Citra (and actually more generally, most) games in game mode, and it will just work.

With much more details in this post to get it working in desktop mode as well, but also while strongly discouraging you from doing so. (In case you mess up desktop mouse config.)

Also - thats it, no more help from me, because you called me a dick.

Good luck on finding someone else to explain to you the 5 potential controller configuration layers in steam, from now on, because no one does.


Take this as a learning experience.",SteamDeck
jhhsvja,"A bit of clarification and explanation! Thanks for that.

I see you say ‚Äúplay most games in game mode‚Äù, which ordinarily I‚Äôd be happy to do, but the 3D emulation in this case doesn‚Äôt work in game mode, so it has to be run in desktop mode. In this case it absolutely *won‚Äôt* ‚Äújust work‚Äù.

Still, you‚Äôve given me some ideas to try, so that‚Äôs useful! Thanks for that too.

As an aside I called you a dick because you were being a judgmental dick and leapt to a completely false assumption. It‚Äôs also interesting that what you tried to handwave away in your earlier post has subsequently taken you upwards of 17 paragraphs to explain, all because you wanted to try and make me appear ignorant and lazy. 

I‚Äôm actually grateful for your more detailed explanation - thank you for that - but you absolutely were being a dick and I called you out on it. It would have cost you nothing to share the initial link in your post and put something like ‚Äúhave you made sure to set the controller scheme in game mode?

Why don‚Äôt you take this as a learning experience not to try and score points off someone who‚Äôs looking for help?",SteamDeck
jhhyla9,"except that it does.

if you mean skipping and the game being slow. use powertools to turn smt off (that would make it behave almost exactly to desktop mode performance wise (because it does a very similar thing to desktop mode in terms of how it presents the cores to the emulator)).

or wait for the steam os 3.5 patch that should fix this kernel bug so you get better single core performance in game mode as well.

As for your retort, because I help 20 people a day on average (nowadays more like 10), and you need something to differenciate who is capable of learning stuff, and who would just respond with lol, tldr;

so you start with the least effort possible basically. after a year of doing this.. ;)

If its not performance related, citra 3ds emulation in game mode works. Thats the only thing I can tell you. If you havent found a way to ""launch the emulator alone"" in desktop mode, and installed it via emudeck - steam rom manager, make sure the emulators parser is checked (green meaning active), and then preview, generate applist and add to steam. that way you can launch the emulator itself in game mode as well. an pick games installed on the 3ds internal storage f.e.

if you need a mouse in game mode, in steam controller config map one to right touchpad, map leftmouseclick to right touchpad down click.",SteamDeck
jhi4hnt,"Only it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm talking very specifically about not being able to play 3ds games in stereoscopic 3D from game mode - because you can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm aware that you can play 3ds games *without* 3D from game mode, but that‚Äôs not what I want to do.

My specific problem is that I cannot switch screens when playing a 3ds game in 3D - the button mapped to that function in the controller scheme in desktop mode does not switch screens when you press it.",SteamDeck
jhi6g29,"You still havent got it right - 

I'm not dealing with people who want others to service them long time, when the information was already presented to them on a silver platter.

Emulator controller configuration maps swap screen to a keyboard input. you can look that up in the emulator controller config if you must. Or in the controller profile emudeck provides FOR GAME MODE ONLY. (In there L4 would be mapped to a keyboard input. To the same keyboard input, for both.)

You would configure back buttons in the steam gamepad mode config (the one thats an alternative you can switch to in desktop mode by long pressing start, with mouse mode being active as the standard once you boot into desktop mode) thats available to configure in steam itself, you would switch to it in desktop mode, after you've made configuration changes there by long pressing the start button, because steam input starts up in mouse mode, when you boot to desktop.

And if you mess up configuring the gamepad mode in steam in desktop mode, or even more catastrophic, the mouse mode - there is no one out there willing to walk you through resetting that, with a potetntially messed up mouse control scheme...

Also your ""service me longtime"" attitude is horrific. Just saying - take a clue. Read the information thats already on the page.

Because I'm telling you dont do this, if you are prone to not know what you might change in a controllerconfig, that then affects everything once you boot into desktop mode.

Also an option to reset that controller config in the steam desktop mode layout was not there in the beginning of steam os, so people who did, had to literally reset their steamdeck. Thats where the anxiety comes from, by now a way to reset it in desktop mode might have been added, but I'm in no way stupid enough to try to mess with that config in desktop mode, then fail, and then try to get back to default, just so I could tell the tale.

Thats you - because you actually seem to have a motive.

I could also teach you how to change emualtor settings in game mode, becuase its literally the same emulator window, just in a different UI, but I dont know what other programs you might need to have to run in tandem to get stereoscopic 3D to work (in game mode its kind of one program active, one programe maybe in the background and thats it), and frankly, I'm disgusted by you just endlessly pushing for someone else to do the work.

And that comes from me doing 20 minutes support sessions for people having messed up controls, but having no idea anymore in which of the 5 controller configuration layers they might be dealing with, when f.e. playing a retroarch game that was launched via emulation station, in desktop mode.

Then there are literally 5 controller input layers active at all time.

I've explained that 5 times in detail (not to you, but in here and other outlets), no more flipping chance I'd do it again. So thats the core emotion I connect with this issue.",SteamDeck
jhi7q08,"Also, I'm still unclear on one concept, and that is, if the controller profile gets switched, if you start the same steam shortcut, from steam in desktop mode, that you configured to use the emudeck preset in game mode.

I dont think so, but it might, so you can try that as well.

I dont think so, because you could then switch focus away from that window, and steamdeck controls would still be set to what that window wanted them to be set. And that sounds to me like somthing Valve wouldnt leave in by mistake.

But I'm actually still unsure what the behavior in that situation is, so you could try it...",SteamDeck

As such, your threat to withhold knowledge of how to change emulator settings in game mode is both (a) irrelevant and (b) pointless as I already know that there is no emulator setting that currently exists that would get the 3D functionality to work in game mode, becaus game mode has dynamic scaling.

So learn about the mentioned aspects (I differentiated three different controller configuration layers for you, twice).

With your first response being ""my support agent isnt respectful enough"", but what was wrong with my approach, why did it all end like this?

I mean I clearly stated ""you are disrespectful"", ""you are a dick"", ""I came here"", and ""I bought a thing"" (two thing actually), and ""do you even speak english, this all sounds like gibberish to me"" -- so now I get personalized step by step instructions that I understand, right?!

Look guys, I bought an I phone too! Lets text while you explain to me how it works! Look, this is my approach of using the internet, and people on it.

Also here is something you will never see, a language proficiency certificate, for a second language, at the highest possible proficiency level. (From Cambridge Institute).

I‚Äôm now waiting for the ROG Ally to stop my collection for a while so I can focus on getting my Degree and continuing my education after that.",SteamDeck
jh9od9c,"Right now, I have a SD, OLED Switch, and Vita. I had my switch first of course. When I got the deck I really got into emulation but felt like with some of the PSP games, the emulation just felt off or not true to the original experience. Plus I don't want to always use the big ass SD for something light in performance. So I picked up the vita and have been using the vita for emulating everything PS1 and under. It's so pocketable and I'm having a good time playing some of the vita and PSP titles that I never got the chance to play when I was younger. Plus it feels great to play playstation games on Sony hardware.",SteamDeck
jhayr3f,I'm agreeing with you on that every once in a while I'll see one of the smaller ones and go ü§î sadly none of them are clamshells like the GBA SP or Nvidia Shield.,SteamDeck

jh9kq6e,"I have one of the Miyoo Minis - bottom right - and it's very nice having a portable that is actually pocketable. Though I think OP has the mini pro which is a smidge larger.

I tend to play Gameboy and SNES games on it though it can handle up through PS1. It's small enough to stick in your pocket which makes it a great travel companion. If you're clever with the RetroArch cores you use, you can even share saves and save states between it and the steam deck.",SteamDeck
jh9lypy,Try running RE4 remake on the steam deck then stop when you realize it looks worse than the original. Then try streaming it from your pc and stop because the stutters too much and is unenjoyable. Those other hand helps have more hp than the deck.,SteamDeck
jh9z8vs,"I have a few handhelds myself, but usually there are some differences between them. 

I haven't done any emulation on my steam deck, so that's one of biggest differences. 

I didn't buy any of the windows handhelds that released, but I did buy a 2nd steam deck and made it a dedicated windows handheld when they were 10% off lol.",SteamDeck
jhbdceu,"Just to weigh in here, personally I have a deck, a switch lite and a hacked PS Vita, and they're all good at certain things. The deck is great for all the PC games, and I've used it for emulating certain things, home consoles like ps2 or snes, but something feels so wrong about playing gameboy games on a steam deck. It's too big and heavy. The vita is better suited to that type of emulation because its small and light, more akin to a gameboy or gameboy advance. Though when I started zelda a link to the past (the snes version) on the deck I was amazed at how good it looked, the colours and sharpness was great for how old the game is. I never had a snes or played many games from that time frame (I'm a 90's kid and grew up on the PS1 and PS2) but if you showed me that game without telling me what it was I wouldn't have said it was a snes game. I keep the switch around for Nintendo exclusives and waiting for the lite to be hackable",SteamDeck
jhbpy7v,"That was my first thought. Why settle for the rest when you have the best (and more so when the best is also the *cheapest*). But then again people would probably think I‚Äôm crazy for how many record players I have, or how many cars I *would* have if I had money, so if handheld PCs are someone‚Äôs thing then I can‚Äôt really argue with that.",SteamDeck

jh8tim2,"This is something I was super concerned about but being able to transfer games through steam without having to deal with download speeds from the device itself, using One Drive for important files, steam cloud saves and an external SSD are the solution for this.

jh9wz6n,"I basically won't play the same game on my desktop and Deck.  It's too annoying to wonder if the Steam Cloud is working or fucking it all up.

Not having that nailed down 100% is one of the two biggest gripes I have with the Deck (the other being the screen feeling like a cheap out compared to every other aspect of the hardware, just look at OP's photo, so much bezel and only mediocre colors, while the Deck beats all the other devices in controls, power, ergonomics, etc).

Last time I tried to play a game on Deck and PC, I lost all my saves.  Installed a game on PC that I was playing on Deck, and Steam took my empty save folder on PC and overwrote my 30hour save on the cloud...",SteamDeck
jh9a6md,"Don't know about OP, but in my case I originally only wanted a Switch for the portability and possibility to play some of my favourite games on the go. 

... Thing is, none of those games are Nintendo titles, and I personally have never really cared for Nintendo games or even liked them that much. So even though I almost got the Switch for myself a couple times, I eventually went back on my decision because of that, because it simply wasn't worth it to pay +300‚Ç¨ just to be able to play Witcher 3 and two more games on a train ride, especially when so many of my favorite games are not on the Switch either and the console itself is mostly geared toward gaming franchises that I simply do not care about.

Getting a Deck has completely replaced the need for me to ever get a Switch. Truthfully, the only Switch games I'd play ATM are Smash Bros and Mario Kart, which are precisely the games I bought my brother when we got him his Switch last Christmas. He's really into Nintendo games and he'd been wanting that console for a really long time. So it all worked out in the end.",SteamDeck
jh91swd,"Great question. Honestly my plan was to get the Aya neo line up but I soon realized that maybe it was better to have a more colorful collection with devices from different brands. After getting my Deck I scored the aya neo 2021 retro power and started from there. 

I know all of them have the same chipset and specs but for me is all about the design and different gimmicks. After having 3 6800u devices I decided to stop because even if they had different designs that was just a little too much. The last one I was going to get was the onexplayer 2 but as soon as they announced the ROG Ally I decided to wait and get that one instead. 

I‚Äôm not really into cloud gaming devices because as we all know they depend a lot on a good internet speed and I‚Äôm not really a fan on them really.

Thank you for the appreciation comment!!",SteamDeck
jh92gbj,Thank you so much. I would say that my daily driver is my Miyoo mini because of the size. It‚Äôs smaller than a Joycon and can play up to ps1 games.

jh92nfi,I mean the deck has a really special place for me. Steam os is extremely practical and simple to use after a while and being able to quickly go from days gone to vampire survivors is something out of this world but my Win 4 is very very close to the deck. Not only because I got it for the base price which was about 900$ but because it is very practical too.

The skin I have on my deck is a Gundam skin that I bought from POP SKIN. I‚Äôll send you his YouTube channel if you want to see his work. I reached out to him through reddit and sent him the money through paypal. Got my skin like 5 days after.  https://youtu.be/oAxpkWKo-Zs",SteamDeck

If that device is less than 1000$ you should give a try!

In my case I would only pick the GPD Win 4 over the deck because of how portable and powerful it is. Awesome physical keyboard  and the very cool psp like design.",SteamDeck

jhb41pw,"I‚Äôm going to be honest with you. None of them are going to replace your current setup. If you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice fps and a little bit of quality then I would suggest you to get the gpd win 4 or wait for the ROG Ally. 

The win 4 is very powerful, more than the Deck, comes with windows 11 and is super portable. On the other hand the rog ally is supposed to be a monster performance wise but we dont know the price yet.

I only had 2 consoles, GameCube (I literally BEG for it) and a N64 (My lovely Godfather brought from the US)

Been working since I was 8-7 years in a mini market (colmado) with my dad (not by choice) I had to woke up at 3am every fucking day in order to be back home around 6:30, take a shower and go to school til 1pm‚Ä¶ Then, work again at 6pm - 9pm. (Terrible childhood, got out at 18 and been working a lot for myself since then)

Besides the things that they‚Äôre meant to be providing me as a kid, I was never ever gifted something else‚Ä¶ Just more work, everybody got a PSP (I didn‚Äôt) I got the GameCube by miracle.

jhaslkq,"Cheers for sharing this. As a fellow Immigrant myself, I can closely relate to your experience. As a child I never had a proper gaming console. All I played on my AMD K6 pc was Neo Geo games because thats all it could run(besides OG resident evils). Fast forward to present day, after migrating to the US alone, finishing my Degree and making middle class salary, I am able to afford almost anything which I couldn‚Äôt as a child. Gaming being one of them. I now have each and every console that I wanted as a kid. My brothers always asks me, why do I still play old school games, while there are so many new AAA games in market. I wish one day I could make them understand the nostalgia factor is the main reason that makes these game‚Äôs amazing.

PS. The American Dream is still real. Anyone can make it as long as you put down the effort for it.",SteamDeck

jh9ehlu,7th gen APUs are what I am waiting on as well. If the Ally is as cheap as they are saying I will get one. I mean from my calcs we are looking at 5 to 6TF of performance on the ally at 35w and 2 at 15W. Far stronger than the deck. I never saw the point with the 6800u if I am honest feels more like a sidegrade than a true upgrade. Will keep the deck.

jhbgmph,"Congratulations man you deserve it. The hard work pays off.

I hear you on the ROG Ally as well. I do like 80% of my gaming on the Deck these days and love AAA games, so if the price is right I will probably upgrade. 

With that said though, I hope they can provide a decent software experience because that is what really sets the Deck apart imo. I hate using Windows on a touchscreen. It just feels awful and makes it feel like a hacked together DIY project compared to SteamOS feeling like a polished console. 

I'm also bummed there's no touchpads on the Ally. Am I the only one who absolutely loves the touchpads on the Steam Deck? Once you get used to them, using the touchpads in unison with the gyro makes for an amazing FPS experience that joysticks just can't match. Yet no other manufacturers seem to value adding them to their competitors. 

So while the Ally looks awesome and I might buy one. If they released a Steam Deck Pro at the same time, it would be no contest on which one I'd buy. With that said though Asus has been making some amazing hardware in recent years. My Zephyrus G15 is a game changer of a gaming laptop.

They can't protest either, because not working means, people are dying.

It's just luck. Or privilege/generational wealth. And sure. Some people get lucky -- and hard work is definitely involved. But lots of people work hard and never get lucky.

I knew a dude that went from fixing cars to a six figure IT job, and then to trucking.  

The problem is, people forget what REAL sacrifice is.  I blame part of that on an early education system (k-12) that doesn‚Äôt teach people how to deal with money/finances.  So, as the other person said well, they get stuck running in place.  Even with the economy tanking right now, there is a shortage of tradesmen, healthcare workers, IT, truckers, and construction work.

I used to work for a non profit that dealt with urban minorities in poverty. While luck can be a factor as well as things as ""privilege/generational wealth"" hard work is 100% still a necessity and I've seen impoverished people break the cycle all the time. Especially immigrants.

Learning systems. Businesses. Coding languages. Etc isn't ""luck"" these are things that require effort and dedication that absolutely betters one position. I broke free from a poverty cycle.

No. Lots of people run in place. They never adapt or solution their situation. If you work really hard at a call center expect to stay a glorified phone clerk.

jhci2d5,"I agree with much of what you said, but.. I would say that having luck or generational wealth as a pre-requisite for success is misleading and/or undervaluing the potential for success which comes from a combination of hard work + skill, raw talent, or intelligence. While yes I‚Äôd agree that simply working hard is not enough for *anybody* to become successful- it‚Äôs more than enough for the right people to become successful (by that I mean those who are gifted intellectually, or have a rare talent which they are able to figure out how to capitalize off of through hard work, or they are genetically predisposed to be at the top of whatever given field assuming that they apply their raw potential and act on it.
I agree that lots of people get lucky, and there are plenty of people that work really hard and never get anywhere‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs *not always* the failure of the system preventing them from getting further through their hard work, sometimes it‚Äôs something else- like working really hard in a field that‚Äôs over saturated or that your skills aren‚Äôt well suited for, or sometimes it‚Äôs the failure to see when a career path is a dead-end (whether that‚Äôs b/c of an employer or the industry at large, people very often fail to see when the industry they devoted lots of time and resources into is no longer a sustainable option for future success). 
All that said, of course luck can and does often play a large role in success. But, my point is that one can be successful without the help of any luck whatsoever. It just takes the right mindset, a willingness to adapt and pivot, and sometimes a lot of patience and willingness to ‚Äúre-start‚Äù in a new field once it‚Äôs clear that the field you had worked hard to grow in is no longer a field which has a sustainable path to grow a career. 
So I guess, without (any) luck it can become pretty difficult and often requires much more then *just hard work*, however: I absolutely believe with the right mindset and determination one can be successful without any luck at all.",SteamDeck

jhhogpr,"While a game is running:

L3+R3 > Video > Aspect ratio. Set aspect ratio there.

Then find

Quickmenu > Overrides > save as content directory override and

Quickmenu > Overrides > save as game override

Do both for good measure. (game override saves it per game and has the capability to override all general settings, content directory override saves it per game system (think snes).)

You have to do this per system (so think snes). If you friend managed to do that ""globally"", they are really talented. :)

And if you friend managed to do it ""by moving/modifying bezel dimensions"" this wont help and you would be still effed.

In that case, your best path of action is a nuke.

Before nuking retroarch though, you might try

Emudeck --> Tools --> emu guides --> retroarch --> reset config

in desktop mode, but if your friend was creative, that might not do what you want. (because 3 different configs per emulator core)

If you need to nuke:

In linux file explorer make sure that ""show hidden files and folders is enabled"", then find:

home/.var/apps/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch/

and find the save and the (savestate) folders in there, make sure to back up every file thats in there. Do it. No crying afterwards.

After that delete the entire org.libretro.RetroArch folder from /home/.var/apps/

And install emudeck again, just over the existing installation is fine.
That then will install and setup Retroarch again.

The issue being that all those settings can be set in three different files per ""emulator core""; so you really have to know where to look, and I dont have the time to explain.. :)",SteamDeck

Double check controller layout in Steam game mode; 2.) Reset the controller config within Emudeck for Citra while in Desktop mode; 3.) Install Emudeck again over original installation; 4.)

Failing that you can get them over here in AU, but only through an importer (such as Kogan, unfortunately) with a fairly hefty markup. I paid $829AU I think for a 64GB, and it arrived within a couple of days.

Also there may be warranty complications when buying one overseas vs onshore.

A quick tip for using the trackpads: it's about swipes. Don't treat the pad as a flat joystick that you move your thumb around the way you would a push a joystick. Treat it like a flat surface that you send your thumb across like you would swipe away your phone notifications.

1. Download the .zip option of the game
2. Download & Install Lutris (skip if already done, ofc)
3. Unzip the game into a folder of your choice. I put mine on my SD card.
4. Open Lutris. In the top left corner there's a plus icon. click that and select ""Add Locally Installed Game""
5. Game Info tab: name the game. I did ""HoloCure"". Select the ""Wine (runs Windows games)"" runner.
6. Game Options tab: in the executable field browse to the game .exe file. so in my case it's on my SD card under ""Games/HoloCure/HoloCure.exe"". in the Working Directory field point it to the same folder as the .exe file is located (example: ""Games/HoloCure"").
7. Save the configuration and run the game.

If you want to add the game to Game Mode, close Steam in Desktop Mode and once it closes right click on the game in lutris and select ""Add steam shortcut"". Once you return to Game Mode run the game. the game crashed to game mode for me the first time I launched it but every other time it booted up fine.

The resolution is too high for the deck to be handle correctly, so I downgrade it in 720p and it‚Äôs blurry as fuck. 
If I use a TV screen then the blurry effect is less present. But that‚Äôs another story. 

If you plan to use a screen, try to take something not too big. 1080p screen in 16:10 or 16:09 work well, but when you go to bigger (ok it‚Äôs a 3440x1440p so twice the capacity of the deck screen‚Ä¶) it‚Äôs not easy. 

For world of Warcraft I was using a 1080p screen and it was great (until the screen died. A old buddy I‚Äôve got since my winter 2008)

The Steam Deck has the same GPU whether you have a screen or not, if you run a 1440p monitor at 720p it‚Äôs blurry, has nothing at all to do with the Steam Deck. 

The way to look at it is that 2560 X 1440 is QHD. 

It‚Äôs almost 4x the resolution of the Steam Deck display. As a rough rough number, If you can run it with 25% or 30% performance, then you‚Äôre gonna be fine running at 1440p. If not try 720p or get FSR happening. I believe there is a also a few other scaling models that it can do if you‚Äôre doing a nice square scale up from 720p to 1440p.

jhcnfm5,"Depends on what you're running on. Maybe I should've specified some caveats as I am kinda comparing apples and oranges. I didn't mean to be disingenuous, so let's clear that up

The average pc gamer according to Steam still runs a 720p monitor and at 3x that resolution (I run 3 monitors as one ultrawide) an RX580 outpaces the PS5 in most game's ""performance"" mode which can reach up to 120 fps at 1080p if you ignore the fact that the RX580 doesn't have RT or DMA but is also not optimized for.

The PS5's 4k maxes out at 60FPS and many games on the RX580 will nearly reach the same output if you drop settings a little bit. It should also be noted that I haven't played the newer, more graphically intense games, and my results are more skewed towards older titles, which typically run without much work on either system

If you compare using the raw specs, yes, the RX580 lags behind a bit, especially with RT (which it actually can do with newer drivers, but don't expect more than 15fps@720p).",SteamDeck
jhap3xd,"I don't think you can quite max out Returnal with vram to spare, at least not on the mobile 6gb version. And I had to set rt to low. At higher settings, it probably takes up a lot more.

How about Doom Eternal? I think a texture pool size of High/Ultra is the best I can get with the 6gb vram I get on the mobile gpu. The ultra nightmare with Rt on probably will need close to 8gb vram. So, doesn't PS5 just use a lower texture quality setting in this case?",SteamDeck

The handle is smooth so it won't mar the trigger and where it contacts the back shell it's on the inside, so you won't see it. Once you've pried away the shell at the triggers, just continue using your fingers to pull the shell apart.

Oh, except for the seam where your device doesn't quite close right.

&#x200B;

>This is way better than using a pry tool or pick or whatever plastic item for going around the edges, which will damage the seams, if even just a little.

It really shouldn't if you do it right. The opening tools are of a softer plastic than the Steam Deck shell, so the only way you're going to damage it is if you use too much force and go too fast. And that's exactly what the author of the article did.",SteamDeck
jhiplnn,"Those plastic tools don't mar the edge when used properly. This is my gig. I do it for a living, and the number of devices I have scarred is far, *far* less than the number that are returned with no problems.

> This is my gig. I do it for a living

I'm also an electronics engineer. I've been working on electronics for 30 years. Probably longer than you. Being an electronics engineer is not _an argument_ here.

> the number of devices I have scarred is far, far less than the number that are returned with no problems

so you admit you've messed up at least a few devices. So let's take this from thinking about someone like you who is a professional repair technician and to a homemaker who only has one deck to mess up, and isn't going to go through a few as a learning exercise. It's better to show those people a method that has a higher chance of success. There's _no reason_ to use those plastic pry tools, they have no advantage over what I show. Conversely there's _good reason_ to use the method I describe. Which, I'll guess, you have never even tried, yet you argue against it. Most likely because you're personally invested in the ways you do things, rather than thinking about this objectively.

> prying at the trigger can cause cracking around that edge, and can deform the case around the trigger

No, it can't. I've been using this method for at least 10ish years now on many different controllers as well as on the steam deck since it first came out. It's never left behind any marring, let alone cracks. That's because the plastic in that spot is structural and needs to be thicker for when you drop the controller and it falls on that edge. It's resilient. Again, you're arguing against something you haven't tried once.

> makeshift tools

the pry tools you recommend were invented as makeshift tools for opening mobile phones by people melting old toothbrush handles. That's why they have that form. That's not an argument at all. As an electronics repair engineer you have to always be ready to invent new and better tools when existing ones have an issue, such as having to mar a few steam decks before you learn how to open one without damaging it.",SteamDeck
jhit9fx,">This is my gig. I do it for a living, and the number of devices I have scarred is far, *far* less than the number that are returned with no problems. 

Haha, yeah, you only know how badly things can go when you've been through breaking a few retaining tabs yourself.",SteamDeck
jhjfzbe,"> OP took the admonition to get the proper tools to mean other makeshift tools that also were not designed to open your electronic device

no, i'm an electronics engineer, and i have about 50 different pry tools, and this is the best one for that job. i've been doing electronics for the last 30 years. you're projecting incompetence, and that's arguing in bad faith.

jhhhvef,"Welcome (back) to PC gaming. I have been playing PC games for many years, and here are some shopping tips to orientate you.

check out Humble Choice from Humble Bundle. It is a monthly subscription where you pay $12 every month for several PC games (which you keep perpetually) curated by Humble Bundle. This month‚Äôs games include Death Stranding Director‚Äôs Cut, Rollerdrome, Alien Fireteam Elite and more. 

Also, isthereanydeal.com is a great site which compare the price of games across all legit key selling sites. Often time a game might see better price elsewhere than on Steam. Downside is refund is up to the sites you buy the game from. 

And lastly, you can use https://steamdb.info to find dates for future game sales events. If there‚Äôs a sales event around the corner you might want to refrain from buying any games, and buy them during the sales.

jhfqlet,"If it works for PC it should work for Deck. Beware that Steam and GOG via Heroic may provide you the native Linux version of the game, so you need to research if you can transfer saves between Linux and windows - if that's what you're using. If your PC is Linux too then it shouldn't be too hard. It should just be copying files or folders from your Heroic installation to your Steam installation.

So I turned wifi off and fired up my Heroic shortcut in GameMode, and wow - no games listed. That's really annoying! However, if you add the games as non-Steam shortcuts, they're still playable. If you're relying on GOG cloud saves via Heroic, well, you'd have to be online anyways for that right?

Edit: oh okay, so in each game shortcut's settings panel, you can select ""Run game offline"". So I suppose Heroic doesn't yet have an offline mode capability like the Deck has.",SteamDeck

It's best to keep write operations to SD cards at a minimum, and with the amount of cache updating it's going to wear on the card.

If you're cool with that, then go for it.

jhddecd,i have spider man remastered and jedi fallen order both triple A game‚Äôs currently installed. and yea i use the steam deck as a portable gaming device not a pc. ive been loving it even with no upgrades,SteamDeck
jhfwrxn,Couldn't that dock with an extra external SSD (no idea how it's called) solve that issue for someone who wants to do normal PC stuff with it?,SteamDeck
jhefpng,yup. exactly,SteamDeck
jhdl44v,finally someone understands me lol. i think yt videos often have affiliate links to sell the ssd‚Äôs so its in their interest to advocate for a ssd swap. im sure ill get around to it someday as a present to myself but meanwhile i don‚Äôt ever think about it. i just have fun with this amazing device that would have blown the 15yo me‚Äôs mind.,SteamDeck
jhdqbxp,sorry what are you asking me exactly? whether to buy it or not at that price?,SteamDeck
jhdqqbc,thats a little too expensive for me but it depends how rich you are and how much you want one.,SteamDeck
jhefc1c,what. that linux storage analysis tool has been around for way longer than the deck was ever a thing. you‚Äôre not making much sense. ssd‚Äôs have a shelf life as well.,SteamDeck
jhfu6x9,not really,SteamDeck
jhdjpqx,"I had a chance to compare a 64GB and 256GB Steam Deck side by side. Games were installed on a Samsung A2 512GB microSD on the 64GB model and on internal SSD on the 256GB model. At least with the games I played, loading times were identical.

Also, the SSD may be priced comparably with microSDs but replacing the SSD isn‚Äôt idiot-proof. Personally, since there are easier alternatives, I‚Äôd prefer not to risk breaking my Steam Deck and potentially voiding the warranty.",SteamDeck
jhdf0qs,"i just tested it and it took 12 seconds to respawn. certainly not a full minute but i agree even 12 seconds is a long time. if someone is playing AAA games then i agree its annoying to not upgrade. however if you‚Äôre mostly playing indie games like me its great. even dirt rally 2 functions perfectly and loads fast off the sd.

and fair last point. ill likely upgrade someday, its just that i had a spare micro sd from an old camera laying around so no extra investment needed. i just think people treat the 64gb like it absolutely needs to be upgraded when it really is an amazing experience vanilla with just a sd card with a majority of content.",SteamDeck
jhdrh8y,"you‚Äôre misinformed. you should watch the yt vid comparing the load times of a vanilla with sd card and an upgraded ssd. the vanilla is barely slower and even was faster with one game if i remember correctly. and regarding graphics, can you back up that claim?",SteamDeck
jhefog7,lol false equivalency. you‚Äôre just trying to reassure yourself that you spent extra money to make some games barely run any faster and others to actually load slower than they do on sd. all while voiding your warranty. l take.,SteamDeck
jhehty9,i linked a guide in another comment,SteamDeck
jhdleq2,uhh who said i was angry? just don‚Äôt think your point has legs.,SteamDeck
jhdctsc,then ill just download them onto a new micro sd. no big deal. what a strange argument. not like ssd‚Äôs don‚Äôt also have a shelf life.,SteamDeck
jhfu4jj,yes they did,SteamDeck
jhfxnjp,"I‚Äôve seen plenty of YouTube videos and posts on this sub saying 256GB is the minimum you should buy unless you plan on replacing the SSD.

Going by some of the videos/posts, one would think a 64GB Steam Deck + microSD was completely unusable.

I‚Äôve really only been playing Dreamlight Valley and Witcher 3 (and emulators). At least for those two games, performance and load times are identical for 512GB microSD (Samsung Pro) and internal SSD (256GB Steam Deck) in a side by side comparison. Granted, this varies per game but at least for me, the 64GB works great for the games I play.",SteamDeck
jhiqx7k,"See, that really depends on the end user. 

I recommended a base M1 MacBook Air for my aunt (8GB/256GB) and it fits her needs just fine. She only uses it for web browsing and office documents so she doesn‚Äôt need a lot of storage. I think she actually has 200GB free on the MBA.

I think recommending the 64GB Steam Deck is fine provided the buyer is made aware of possible caveats. 

Based on my experience (all games installed to uSD card):

64GB Steam Deck + 

* **128 or 256GB**: should still have 10-25GB free space on eMMC
* **512GB**: borderline if the card is filled to the max with games, need to monitor storage usage carefully
* **1TB**: likely not enough space on eMMC for shader cache and compatibility data",SteamDeck

jhiap04,"Well in that case you can have a external drive for that. 

No need to carry around 500 roms..",SteamDeck
jhg1jmk,The problem is that many programs save a lot of stuff in the /home/deck directory or others like /var/lib because it is how linux works. You can change some to your external ssd but is cumbersome and difficult to avoid in many installations,SteamDeck
jhdqpy0,"I need you to smuggle one into my country.

No one can know.

I'll send you the details.",SteamDeck
jhelxc8,"I mean the steam cleaner apps. Those storage analysis tools, were all written on PC created for development, which isn't on 64gb of local eMMC memory.

All things have a shelf-life, SD cards are MUCH shorter and they are measured in write and erase cycles, with a memory cell getting around 10,000 of them, once a memory cell starts going bad, it's game over, the cells are generally small at around 2-4mb.

Now SSDs claims a smaller write cycle amount, but the cells are much larger and the backups are much more robust so getting an entire write-erase cycle takes much much longer on SSDs than on SD Cards, thanks to the NAND standard.

Furthermore as SSDs fail, they just get smaller, SD Cards will start to get corrupted data which will further degrade the card.

SD Cards are about 5 years under ideal conditions, and NAND flash is about 10 years.",SteamDeck

I have a 1tb SSD and 1tb Micro SD Card (A2 speed) and the loading times between both are VERY different.

jhfz3pg,I guess I should have specified no one (that matters) said it's necessary.,SteamDeck
jhiwvps,"> She only uses it for ~~web browsing and~~ office documents **so she doesn‚Äôt need a lot of storage**.

yea that's what I thought, too. then I got proven wrong.

but that is entirely meaningless the Deck is a gaming device, a single missclick will install to the internal disk instead of the SD and there you have it the device is full from a single Game.

Steamdeck -> for gaming -> needs Space.
cheapo Laptop -> not for Gaming -> could be used for stuff that doesn't need Space

sure tiny Games exist and you **can** just play those and never anything else. But just like how my Sister managed to fill the Drive of her Tablet even though she only ever uses it for Office stuff, if you aren't the user, assume the worst.

it's really not so hard to upgrade the 64 GB version that anyone with the willingness to do the cleaning required to not brick the 64 GB version wouldn't be able to get a bigger m.2 and replace the drive, yes one is hardware one is software, But it's really not hard.",SteamDeck
jhdkt1u,i‚Äôve definitely heard a few content creators on yt say it‚Äôs essentially mandatory to upgrade and many people who don‚Äôt understand how to manage their ‚Äòother‚Äô space growing out of control think it‚Äôs mandatory too. something i wish the sd handled better on its own without needing third party tools.,SteamDeck
jhhqxdm,I have seen several comments in this sub where people claim the 64GB is unusable without upgrading the SSD.,SteamDeck
jhervei,Yeah I originally upgraded my 64gb to a 256gb NVME with a 512gb SD card... then 3 months later ended up upgrading it to a 1tb NVME and pairing it with a 1tb SD card.,SteamDeck

jhil5yo,"Haha, what's the difference between having an external hard drive and an internal one?

jhgh9m1,why would you need a ssd for those.  i have emudeck already and am not interested in vibrant deck,SteamDeck
jhdtfmu,"
the steam deck reads from a1 and a2 at the same speeds due to the nature of its capped read speed. the only difference is how fast it writes. meaning a1 and a2 only makes a difference during installation and then only if your internet is fast enough. my games install incredibly fast on the a1 its zero issue for me. 

so knowing that, again you can refer to the yt vid showing the performance of the mmc vs the higher tiers and see the difference is negligible if not in favor of the sd card. mine performs identically.",SteamDeck
jhdtnbn,you also didn‚Äôt cite anything for the claim that graphics are improved on ssd upgrade.,SteamDeck
jhdfceo,yea fair. but ssd will also fail in a similar time frame as a sd card so you are in the same predicament either way.,SteamDeck
jhjlq3r,"That‚Äôs on the user. And I‚Äôd expect someone getting the Steam Deck to be somewhat more technically savvy than your sister.

Mind, I know my aunt and I‚Äôve worked on her desktop before so I knew for a fact that 256GB will suffice for her needs.

There‚Äôs no right or wrong choice here regarding what model Steam Deck to buy and how the end user wants to set it up. It merely boils down to user preference and skill level.

64GB + microSD? That‚Äôs fine. One pretty much needs to install all games on microSD and be more mindful of internal storage. Maybe use some tools to clear shader cache every once in a while if they delete and install new games often.

256GB or 512GB model (with or without microSD)? That‚Äôs fine, too. You‚Äôre just paying $130-250 for the convenience of having the higher capacity SSD pre-installed.

64GB + replace with NVMe SSD? Best performance and least cost with high storage. The caveat is that one could potentially void warranty or break their device in case they mess up the hardware upgrade. It‚Äôs fairly low risk but not foolproof.",SteamDeck

if they are they will understand what to do to make the 64GB version that is ""discredited"" work and will choose it if they feel like jumping those dumb hoops, more likely they will replace the SSD

> There‚Äôs no right or wrong choice here 

yes there is, Tech illiterates shouldn't use the 64 GB version, as easy as that.

pulse audio is part of the sound server/tools subsystem on Linux that a lot of features rely on, it can send a sound source to a sound sink, so basically send the sound to a second system or some sort of audio output method.

jhbrkg8,"the problem is probably the deck's built in shader precaching. basically valve fills up your ssd with giant shader downloads to get rid of stutter when compiling new shaders, but it fills up the 64gb model really quickly. 

if you have space on the sd card for it you can use cryoutilities to move your shader caches to the sd card (you should already have cryoutilities by now but if you dont its super simple to use)

if you dont have space on your sd card, delete the shader caches you have and disable shader precaching for the future. dxvk async eliminates stutter from manually compiling shaders pretty well, but this will still lead to some stuttering in demanding games",SteamDeck

However, sometimes they are not deleted when deinstalling. The numbers are app ids, you can look them up on steamdb.info or if you use zshadercachekiller/cryoutilities/etc. they'll show you the game name. However the very long numbers are non-steam games. Only way to find out what they are is by snooping around in the compatdata folder and finding files with the game name. Delete compatdata folders with caution, they can contain save data but deleting shader cache should be without risk.

Edit: And when you checked that none of the folders are leftovers from installed games you can use zshadercachemover to move the cache to the sd card.",SteamDeck

For example, just installing Filelight adds up 1 GB of files, whereas Disk Usage Analyzer takes 300 MB only.

In the OP's case, they have installed the Rockstar Launcher, something with emulation, and the download folder is huge too. That alone is 8 GB in total, which is huge here.

Depends on the game but for No Man's Sky, for instance, you want to set it to emulate the mouse pointer to give it proper gyro aiming.

The new mission packs are legitimately great, and the add-ons give it some extra legs (currently playing the Quake 64 port). 60 FPS, solid battery life...

jhcb4el,"That kind of thing makes my blood boil and I‚Äôm going to share a story that nobody asked for.

About seven years ago, my family‚Äôs house burned down. I almost died. My parents and sister watched helplessly from a thousand miles away via Nest cameras as I tried to escape, not knowing if they were about to watch me burn to death. I got out just before the Internet melted and the cameras went down. Parts of the house started to collapse less than a minute later.

After a week of getting the insurance rolling and buying essentials and digging through the remains of the house for what few things with sentimental value we could find that survived at all and starting the demolition/rebuilding process, things were finally starting to slow down. We were still living out of hotels, because we hadn‚Äôt gotten into a rental house yet, so cooking wasn‚Äôt an option. We went to this Italian place by the main road because it seemed easy. Service was fine, but not fast. We had said all that there was to say already and we were all looking for distraction on our phones.

This drunk woman at the bar kept getting up from her stool to stumble over to our table and loudly lecture us on staring at our screens instead of talking to each other. She got up five or six times to do that, each lecture longer and more slurred than the last. We were all too emotionally drained to do anything but stare blankly at her. I realize that nobody at the restaurant knew what our situation was, but I still feel like the bartender or a manager or somebody should have told her to mind her own business. They didn‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt remember the food. We never went back to that restaurant. They tore it down recently. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. But I hate that woman and I still think about that night often.",SteamDeck

jheqjrw,"Try this while your Steam Deck is hooked up to the monitor with the USB-C cable:

1. Press the Steam button
2. Select the Settings option
3. On Settings screen, select the Display option
4. On External Display Scaling, try turning off the Automatically Set Resolution toggle button by selecting it and see if you can manually change the resolution on the dropdown menu

It could be possible the game itself might be locked to certain resolutions that you can't change. For example, when I play Valkyrie Elysium, I can't change the resolution to anything other than 1280x720p even though the monitor/tv can support up to 4K and there is nothing that can be done about it without the developers enabling it through an update.",SteamDeck
jhesaam,"1. Select the game that you want to play (so that you are on the page of the game)

2. Click on the Gear icon 

3. Click on Properties

4. Scroll down to ""Game Resolution"" and click it

5. Select the resolution you want to play the game at

6. Launch the game

If you set the resolution to your monitor/tv's max resolution you can always lower it.  Eg. If you have a 4k tv you can lower the resolution to 1080p if the deck can't handle the game in 4k.",SteamDeck
jhesqen,"First I went into Steam button, Settings, Display and turned off automatic resolution and set it to the max the display had, then I went into a specific game in my library, Start button, Properties, General, Game Resolution, then set it to the desired resolution. That opened up the in-game options to increase resolution up to whatever I set. For example, if I put it at 1440p in the properties menu, then all the settings from 300p to 1440p were available.",SteamDeck

jhezk3j,"Not bad, I wonder if anyone has tested this enough. Maybe with a proper solder, one could negate the need for the extra battery then just power it from the deck‚Äôs battery.

jhfiqyb,I believe another thread mentioned that solder is not the way to go when they were doing the LED mod.,SteamDeck
jhgb8sr,"Not really, no. Long answer:

VR rendering needs to render for each eye, so you'd have to try and run things at the absolute minimum, and using 720p would give a performance hit comparable to 1440p; something the Deck can't handle unless it's an extremely simple game. That's not exact as the resolutions aren't 16:9 but it's easy to mention those as an example. VR headsets use much higher than that for clarity.

It would look extremely blurry and terrible. Add in the fact that you need high fps to avoid motion sickness (also out of what the Deck can do at high resolution) and you're way beyond feasible.

SteamVR UI and background process also have a performance impact which is negligible on a high powered PC, but the 25W APU on the Deck would probably just detonate with that on top of the game rendering lol.

I'm sorry, but it won't work.",SteamDeck
jhgtf0s,"I‚Äôve thought of this myself, thinking how cool it could be to have the deck attached to you somewhere, like on a belt of something, and then the display is something much smaller than an occulus quest 2, but I‚Äôm not sure how well that would work since you need some space for the screens.

I bought a Vive shortly after launch and just HAD to bring it over for my friend to see.. Used my laptop at the time which was actually a little less powerful than the deck; 15w dual core i5, 12gb ram, 2gb 940mx

It actually ran simple things just fine, we played all the way through Superhot that night, I think we messed around on some other little demos as well.. I don't remember if it was locked at 90fps but it was definitely playable to the point my friends wanted one ü§∑",SteamDeck

I'll summarise everything here and post links at the end. 

For my setup I have a 3D printed stand, Bluetooth keyboard and Xbox controller. To play WoW I just installed the console port addon (ill link a great tutorial video), I only tweaked the controls slightly and it works amazingly well. For those saying it doesn't look comfortable or just use a laptop.... The screen is big enough to play casually but if I need to see more I just dock it to my TV and play on the couch.... Or just play it handheld! So it's much more convenient than a laptop.

I also live in the UK, the weather here isn't usually this nice haha, and I have to admit the 3 different candle scents were maybe a bit much!

Keyboard - this isn't available but there's plenty similar ones out there:

It's of course going to be much better at windows 11 than the Deck is (and hopefully will support Secureboot), and will target modern AAA games, but both devices can coexist.

The big thing is that unlike the other companies, Asus actually owns its own fabs (Pegatron , etc), so they will actually MAKE the devices, rather than have them outsourced.  And with Best Buy as a partner and RMA center, that's going to be a big sell for them.

Just keep in mind that no matter what comes out, there's ALWAYS going to be a faster model a year or two later, so ""endgame"" simply does not exist.  This isn't like the console or 'traditional' handheld market.",SteamDeck

jhhl7bd,"The problem that I see Asus having isn't that it won't be a great device. It absolutely will be. It's probably awesome. The problem is that there isnt a good price to sell it at. No matter what they choose. 

At $699, they're basically making nothing on it. Economies of scale only go so far. Buying two million parts costs double what one million parts is. Once you're at that scale, there are no more discounts to be had. Go look at any bulk supplier. There is always a tier where buying more doesn't save you anything. At $699 they are making a bet that they are going to ship MILLIONS of units. Anything less than that will be a failure. 

But at $799 it's starting to get too expensive and most people that _would cross shop the steam deck_ are going to tap out because it's too expensive. Maybe if you're looking at the $649 model. (And I know what valve said two weeks into the sales, but since then the 64gb and 256gb have been going in and out of stock. The 512 doesn't. Which indicates that just like always, the early adopters are willing to pay more, and now that it's out, most people are choosing the cheaper models). I won't argue this, I will only repost what I just said. Because it's the only actual evidence that exists. 

$899 is the same as $799. Just with even less sales. 

At $1000, it's just too expensive and no one will buy it. Well some people will, but not enough for a company like Asus to care. They want to move _millions_ of units. They can't sell the same number of devices as Aya and be successful. They need to sell more, or they will divert the internal resources somewhere else.

How well the Asus ally does is going to be the price they sell it for. If it's over $1000, it's gunna fail hard. The steam deck performs way to well at $400 for most people to see any value in a $1000 handheld. 

_""but Aya""_ I hear you say. 

Asus is shooting for MUCH larger numbers than Aya sells. They are banking on economies of scale. If they don't sell enough to teach their threshold, it will be a failure. They're not going to sell a device for a $7 profit and be ok with only selling 20,000 of them a year. Their r&d departments have better things to do. That would be a profit of like $140k, which is a rounding error for Asus. Aya on the other hand would be fine with that. 

Asus needs to get their lowest model down to $699 before if becomes a good deal. And if all of you that claim the SD is a loss leader are right (I don't think you are) that again doesn't leave a lot of room for profit for Asus. 

Granted, Asus can leverage those economies of scale. But it's not like that is going to be _that_ much of an advantage over valve. If the numbers are to be believed and valve has shipped over a million steam decks, you don't get much more savings out of 2 million or 4 million units. You're basically at the end of bulk pricing. At some point with bulk, it is at the lowest possible and going past that won't help. 

I don't know what Asus is thinking. If it's in the price range it needs to be, there is not enough profit. If it's out of the price range, people will just buy a steam deck. 

Maybe I'm wrong. I don't doubt it will be an awesome device. Not one second. It's going to be very very cool. Especially once someone gets steam os loaded up on it. But I don't see a price range where it could be successful. No matter what number they choose, it's problematic.",SteamDeck

We don't know anything about cost or battery life, we don't know much about real world performance (except for Linus showing what sure doesn't look like 50-100% more gains in FPS vs a Deck despite claiming 50-100% better on paper performance lol.)

The only thing we can actually say with certainty about the Ally is that it lacks trackpads. Personally, that's kind of a dealbreaker for me, given how nakedly useful the trackpads are.

jhk3vtr,"See, the thing is that the fact that they say something vague like ""extremely competitive"" is an indication that it isn't. If price was a selling point, it'd be front and center in their marketing strategy from the word go.

""The most powerful gaming handheld on the planet, only $50 more than the equivalent Steam Deck.""  

Or even better:

""Twice the power, same price as the equivalent Deck."" 

Stuff like that. 

Yet they aren't saying anything about its price. Typically when you're marketing, you want to lead with your strongest points and downplay the weakspots. And the Ally's hype team has conspicuously downplayed the price and battery life. That to me says they know that folks are gonna balk.

jhko08m,"Sorta, but thats not really what we're talking about. We're discussing economies of scale. 

Where the more parts you buy, the better price you get them for. If you buy 16 gigabytes of ram, you pay retail, if you buy 16 exobytes of ram, you pay a lot less per gigabyte. 

But there are limits. At some point, Samsung won't give you any more discount on ram, no matter how much you buy. Because they have a cost to manufacture the part and need to make a small profit too. No company is going to sell you ram below their cost. 

So, economies of scale only go so far.

The Steamdeck's trackpads are not the reason why it's successful.

>If you cannot play the whole PC library, the device suck. 

The Steamdeck, as it's intended to be used, straight up cannot play some of the most popular PC games out there. Funny how the people who keep bringing up trackpads neglect this point.

>ROG Ally isn't the first PC handeld that's supposed to competition against the deck. They all failed so far.

I'm guessing you're referring to Ayaneo and GPD? Those companies existed before the Steamdeck and are so niche in terms of availability, support and infrastructure, they can hardly be considered competitors. Asus is a completely different animal.

on a PC Trackpads and Back Buttons are must haves for me.
I could easily live without sticks.
(that probably makes mine an unpopular opinion but that's how it is)

and doesn't the PS have a trackpad? Idk I don't play on home consoles.

I've put enough fingerprints on my Vita I know claiming it didn't have trackpads is misleading, because it had a small enough Touchscreen that it didn't need them.
and the Stylus of the DS is THE Reason I loved Tactics Games and many many other DS Games as much as I did, again that made track pads unnecessary.

imo, the handheld PCs aren't small & light enough to make using the Touchscreen viable.


> If you have to limit to some games then it's not ready to hit the market.

the deck can't run a tiny handful of Steam Games

but a vast majority of Steam games will become Garbage without proper Mouse input.

(turned out the wife wasn't very diligent about cleaning the lint trap and it got backed up inside stopping it from heating up. Spent about 30$ on a new coil that I didn't even need after taking the leaf blower to the exhaust and blowing out. Kept it just in case. 30$ was better than the hundreds for a repairman. YouTube videos helped a lot)",SteamDeck
jhbah41,Protect,SteamDeck
jha5jqb,"Yea im thinking lint could be an issue too, as it finally started working again this morning... Not sure how long that'll last. Intermittent issues are the WORST to diagnose. But the two parts some are saying could be the timer (which I think we already replaced) or one of two internal thermostats. If im lucky its the little $10 fuse or just lint build up. It really doesn't help that insurance keeps going up. It's about 230 but is going up to 265 for... Reasons? We haven't hit anything... Haven't even used roadside assistance. Their excuse is that there have been more accidents in the area. Its Root insurance...

Another issue is our car situation. The one we're paying on is an 03 yukon denali because that's all we could get approved for. The commute car is down with a blown head gasket, 03 buick century. So now I'm going to work in something that gets 12mpg. It's hard finding an affordable car that can fit 3 full carseats and all the things needed for the kids (esp the baby). Thankfully the yukon will be paid off in another 11 months. The house in 4 years? Something like that.

Really wish I could just get something like a honda super cub for going to work lol.

Have considered selling the Steam Deck. It's a 512. Between that and whatever I get from selling the buick... Dunno. There's a dealership offering cash for clunkers if I can get it there... But that means yet another car payment",SteamDeck
jhaa79r,"Had to ditch my van back a couple years after having my head gaskets replaced (close to a grand) when I took it in to get the brakes checked and the mechanic pointed out the motor mount was rotted away and barely there. Ended up getting a used 2015 Nissan leaf for a steal considering it was when used prices were surpassing new. (Dealer has no idea what they were selling and I baited them hook line and sinker) My daily driver and it has been a dream not buying gas, oil changes, typical engine failure issues. Check like auto trader often might get a good deal from someone needing to cash out.

As for the dryer, most likely lint if it's in and oot. Easy fix is pull it away from the wall and remove the exhaust pipe. Take a vacuum (preferably with a hose) and suck out anything from the machines exhaust. If you have a lint trap cleaner, this is the best time to use it. Don't have one make one. Strip of bendy plastic, cut into the edges at an angle and pull the plastic forward. Done! As for parts, Google the make/model and you can likely find any parts for way cheaper than dealer. Bought the heater coils for mine for that 30$ I mentioned, never needed but holding into it in case. Wish you luck with this and the car bro.

jhfi1vc,"Short answer: It depends on you and your lifestyle. I would say do it.

Long answer: I have both a switch and a steam deck. My deck gets way more use because of everything that it can do. You wonder whether or not it‚Äôll be worth it but that‚Äôs the thing about the steam deck; it molds itself to your lifestyle. You want just a pc, it does that. You want a portable steam machine; it is that. You want to get into emulation; it does that extremely well. I think the device is near perfect and can easily fit into anything you want it to do. As far as your question about the switch games; no. You can‚Äôt transfer the games over unless you mod your switch which can be done with the help of other subreddits. If you truly want to play switch games but also want a switch, try checking out emu deck and seeing what all it can do. If you have any other questions feel free to reach out. The steam deck is one of the best purchases I have made in years and I would recommend it to everyone.",SteamDeck
jhfix30,"Definitely situational. I've thought about selling my Switch, but I also can't be arsed to set up emulation on my Deck and deal with configuring it and maintaining it. If it isn't as easy as 'pick up and play' I don't want it. Thus, I keep my Switch for times when I want to play something I can only play on a Nintendo device.

There‚Äôs really only a handful of big mainstream titles (Witcher, Assassins Creed type games) and they run fairly poorly on the switch. It teased me in terms of handheld gaming so I decided I‚Äôd be better off with the steamdeck and recieved my one last week. It‚Äôs leaps and bounds more powerful than the switch, it has infinitely more games available on it and it‚Äôs an absolute star for tinkering and modding. Sure there‚Äôs some games that won‚Äôt run for various reasons like requiring windows(you could actually install windows if you wanted) or some games that are just too new and demanding, But the steamdeck can play the vast majority of games that exist.

So in my opinion the steamdeck is absolutely a good replacement for the switch. I wish I had researched the steamdeck in January so I could have skipped the stepping stone that the switch was.

3. Bare minimum controls means that there's no accessibility.  No proper trackpads for mouse controls or smooth movement, no gyros, no back buttons.  You're essentially paying more for a handheld console that WILL do less.

4. Less community support, likely less moddability or unique apps made for it.  It may have better specs, but the Steam Deck has more dedicated support from both the community and (probably) the creators.

What killed me was that it didn't even have the ability to jump so the movement felt like what may have been a competent shooter back in the days of the PS3, but not today. The entire game felt like a linear corridor shooter, with extremely dumb A.I., easy to cheese boss fights that are just bullet sponges, horrible weapon audio, and really bland uninspiring level design littered with invisible walls. None of that helped with the bland story that didn't catch my attention and the extremely repetitive end game.  

I really like People Can Fly, always have, so I hope they make a sequel that remedies these issues because I felt like they were almost onto something magical, but as a looter shooter, it missed the mark -at least for me.  

@OP, I am in the same boat as you. I've exhausted all the looter shooter options and am looking for that next special something to hold me over until Diablo IV.

And it is closed source, so what it did yesterday, might not be what it does tomorrow, and no one can look at code to find out. :)

Also windows ""emulation"" actually would be prohibited, because of overhead, most modern windows virtual machines rely to a large part on translation layers as well (faster), and thats exactly what proton is.. :)

PC has had these throughout all the console generations but the point remains - these are reasons to get a pc just as they were reasons to get the consoles that shared these perks.

jhe6jre,"The primary thing that you need to understand is that emulators are *console*-specific, not *game*-specific. You can think of an emulator as being a game console made of software.

So for example, ""can I play [x, y, and z] PS1 games?"" is too specific of a question. What you should be asking is just ""Can I run a PS1 emulator?""

This becomes more muddled as you move on to newer, more powerful consoles, where emulator compatability and performance requirements vary, but for consoles as old as the PS1 and the Genesis, it's pretty much just ""if you can run anything, then you can run almost everything.""

Check out EmuDeck, they do a good job of making emulation fairly idiot-proof for beginners. If you get stuck, then remember, think ""console,"" not ""game."" Don't look up ""How to set up Croc on Steam Deck."" Look up ""How to emulate PS1 on Steam Deck.""

Personally, I think it's highly unlikely. There's virtually no margin on the Steam Deck as it is, let alone enough to split with a major retailer.

Also the system doesn't do much to push many secondary purchases.  Sure it has accessories but it's not the same as selling an Xbox and having the customer come back for physical games for the next 5 years.  All the games will be sold online directly from Valve.",SteamDeck

jhdhmpl,"With Steam Input you can do just about anything to the sticks when it comes to Deadzones and how the mouse pointer moves (try wide response curve maybe).  
The first huge hang up with the Sticks on the Deck is that by default the Deck is shipped with a GIANT 30% Deadzone, 
everybody needs to reduce that to like 10% for the sticks to not feel garbage.  

You want to read this guide i've written, the UI got updated a bit since then but the options are still all there:  
https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w2gos4/psa_optimize_your_deadzones/  

You can NOT add auto aim if the developer of a game did not add it to the PC port, which a lot of older Xbox ports did not bother with.  
I don't know about COD4 but if you say it has no native gamepad support then you can probably forget about auto aim there.  

But you can absolutely make any game with mouse feel right. You just need to really dig into the Steam Input menu so you understand what you are doing with all the buttons in there.  
You can also add Gyro Aim, just enable it while you hold down the left trigger so you can use it like ADS instead of it always being on.  

...and in my experience most of the community made profiles are good as a start off point, but i absolutely customize that stuff myself every single time because nobody every does it the way where i'd be happy with it.  

The amount of settings is a bit intimidating at first... take an afternoon, wrap your head around all the Steam Input settings, once you know how it all works and what it does its much less scary and you go straight to the settings that you know you want to change next time.",SteamDeck

jhax91k,"One more far out opinion. Tex Murphy games (Dosbox) (Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directive). To play them on a purly gamepad focused device was impossible until now. :) Because their movement is mouse based for turn and forward and backward, but then you'd need to right click to stop moving, and at the same time you need extreme precision for menuing in dialog menues.

So after I started to set up analog controls with reverse outer zone for joysticks as mouse emulation, and the touchpad for precision mousing, and then put in an autofiring mouse rightclick once the stick reaches the inner zone (inverted outer zone), and then set auto fire interval to max, but then noticed, that the two rightclicks are stil too close together, because double rightclick kicks you out of walking mode, so then I hacked in an alternating command to the rightlclick of inverse outerzone, that does nothing, so I could stretch the autofire interval beyond the built in max --- and then it, just worked.

And then I finetuned delays, and it suddenly felt good. And then I wanted magnification for some ingame scenes, and mapped it to a backbutton within 10 seconds.

jhcmtte,"u/VincibleAndy for the easy fix. 

For those for whom this game worked and then the recent update to Proton broke it, its due to needing to have EA launcher reinstalled. Uninstalling the game doesnt do that right away, as it keeps the user files for the game for a while after.

To fully reset it you just need to delete the folder that stores all of the ""install"" files from the game.

ME - Legendary Edition is stored under 1328670. You can just delete that folder and then run the game with Proton Experimental and it will do a new install of EA launcher and you are good to go.

home/.local/share/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1328670/

 That is also the location of your saves if you want to back those up, even though they should be going to the EA cloud.

jh9aido,"I wouldn't know that you are not using a mouse if wasn't for the Steam Deck camera.

My only problem with using trackpad is that as I'm not used to it, it feels weird for me and I never give it enough time to learn how to play with trackpad (the same for joystick+ gyro)",SteamDeck
jh9ci8l,"After many failed tries over the years with the steam controller, ds4, ds5, steamdeck, I finally thought I had nailed my trackpad+gyro settings playing Prodeus. It felt fantastic. 

Then I loaded up Jedi Knight outcast, overwatch 2 and applied the same settings and couldn't get it to feel good at all",SteamDeck

There are a few games (like the citadel) that have some sort of weird turn acceleration though where flickstick doesn't work right though.",SteamDeck
jhc3uuv,"og Steam Controller power user here. More tips:

* Make sure your Rotation setting is dialed in for your trackpad ""as mouse""!!! Cannot be stressed enough; it rotates the tracking grid in software to line it up with the natural angle your thumb swipes along. This helps DRASTICALLY reduce unintentional vertical ""drift"" from the trackpad
* Set your trackpad as mouse sensitivity to be high. Most Steam Controller users like 180 degrees of camera rotation on a full horizontal swipe. I go even higher. Double that, in fact. 360/swipe. This is so its 180 on a half swipe either direction, which imo makes for better ""fast turning""/""target acquisition"".
* (optional, pending above) Reduce the Sensitivity Vertical Scale by some amount. Since most games lock the camera vertical rotation to some point (in fps' looking straight up to straight down is common), a good plan is for a full vertical swipe to take you from one limit to the other limit. Less (not making it all the way on a full swipe) is fine, hypothetically more (reaching from one limit to the other in less than a full swipe) is a waste. Also; reducing this slider will further help reduce vertical ""drift"" from the trackpad.
* (optional, if using trackball emulation) Set Friction Vertical Scale to 0. I cant recall if the new ui has the description, but if it does this slider actually behaves opposite to the description. 0 kills any vertical spin from the trackball emulation, which serves to eliminate any vertical ""drift"" from the emulated trackball.

Basically, you want the trackpad to be a ""fast turn""/""target acquisition"" input and then do your aiming with the gyro.

I havent played Amid Evil (yet), but this is how I play Ultrakill with the Steam Controller. Been working on getting P-Ranks on violent difficulty, and finding decent success.",SteamDeck
jh8l8qr,"Might be hard to tell from just watching the footage, but I find it much easier to aim with ""Trackpad as Mouse"" vs. using the Right Joystick (even after hours of practicing and tweaking settings, see deadzone reduction values in the video). My [Trackpad + Gyro config](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12csshb/comment/jf2y5wy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is still my preferred layout, but I can still have fun playing trackpad-only if I can't use the gyro for some reason. If you're struggling with shooter controls, a similar config might work for you, just give yourself time to get used to it!

jhbyqy2,Never heard of this but it looks really fun,SteamDeck
jh8pfgi,I personally don't like trackpad + gyro that much...I always use right stick and gyro...just put your thumb on it and gyro works great for me.  I get along really well with that.,SteamDeck
jh9bsox, Boomer Shooter?   Very disrespectful to the computer scientists who invented gaming for you children.,SteamDeck
jh98c6x,It's good for tiny changes.  Like setting up a sniper shot.,SteamDeck
jhacxoh,Anyone have a preference of Amid Evil vs Dusk?,SteamDeck
jhags8r,"Watching this makes me wonder if my trackpads are buggy or something.  I am absolutely, completely unable to get smooth movement like that no matter what settings I use.  For me it's pretty much always jittering around which makes precise aiming difficult.  

(and that's with the gyro turned off btw)",SteamDeck
jhbmbdx,You prefer trackpad only or trackpad+gyro?,SteamDeck
jh9xp5s,"Yeah, gonna get Dusk as well!",SteamDeck
jh9x9ez,"Yes, it looks very mouse-like! Now that I think about it, I didn't like ttackpad-aiming at first either, maybe using it to play [2D shooters like Noita](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12h4pph/ditch_the_stick_why_trackpad_mouse_region_mode_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) helped me transition. It helps to re-bind Fire to your left hand as well, otherwise it will throw off your aiming thumb.",SteamDeck
jh9wg7h,"I had this experience with some games, it could be latency creeping in. When it happened with Deadlink, a simple restart fixed it. I heard using the Deck's framerate limiter can cause lag, and that it's better to use an in-game option if available. I'm pretty sure I had this issue with Black Mesa (don't remember, I'll have to retest).

Mixed input can also mess up in subtle ways, so you might have to go full keyboard/mouse bindings (restart the game after you do that). Hope you can solve those issues.",SteamDeck
jh9u7md,"Yeah, what's nice is whether you aim with a stick or pad, you can always use the other as a menu :) I remember not liking using the pad to aim when I first tried them as well. Maybe what helped me transition was using it in [""Mouse Region"" mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12h4pph/ditch_the_stick_why_trackpad_mouse_region_mode_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to aim in 2D shooters like Noita and Enter the Gungeon. Remapping Fire to left trigger also helps.",SteamDeck
jhaelvl,"Yeah, I think enabling gyro (with either stick or trackpad) is best for quick accuracy. However, some people can't use gyro due to disabilities, tremors, etc. so I just wanted to share how gyro-less trackpad is also a viable alternative that can actually work better than gyro-less stick. Especially without aim assist, which I think Amid Evil lacks (as there is no option for it).",SteamDeck
jhayllq,I wish that more games natively included flick stick.,SteamDeck
jh94gpe,"Fully agreed, I also used trackpads+gyro+backpedals almost exclusively during my playthrough of Amid Evil. Radial menu for weapon selection on trackpad was also essential for me.",SteamDeck
jh8qodf,"Yeah, stick cap-sense is cool, glad that works for you! This YouTuber [ZERO AIM](https://youtube.com/@zero_aim) uses sticks + gyro on Deck as well. Flick Stick is sweet too. That's what I love about the Deck, it gives enough options for everyone :)",SteamDeck
jh93e6b,"I find it interesting how different opinions are on this. Personally, I absolutely can't stand gyro *not* being on all the time. I use it so much also for just looking around, too, probably more often than the right stick in that case.

Either way, options are great!",SteamDeck
jh9vmhp,"Not sure if serious, but:
-  It's not a term I came up with.
- It might have originated as an insult, but I've only heard it used with connotations of endearment and pride, as a way to contrast the experience from modern AAA shooters with excessive guardrails and scripted sequences.
- Like ""roguelites"" it's become a genre in its own right.
- Many devs themselves have embraced the term. This game was part of a bundle literally called the [Boomer Shooter Bundle](https://www.pcgamer.com/humbles-boomer-shooter-bundle-is-one-of-the-best-fps-collections-ive-seen/)

(Really sad I missed that bundle, BTW.)",SteamDeck
jh9wohi,"Yeah, Boomers were the ones saying 1993 Doom was too violent for kids. They sure AF weren‚Äôt the ones playing these games.


Millennials had ‚Äúok Boomer‚Äù for about a week. Gen Z thought it was funny and wanted to say it too, even though they didn‚Äôt seem to know what a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù actually was. Now an entire generation thinks a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù is ‚Äúanyone older than you.‚Äù It‚Äôs a travesty. Like if you came to the US from Europe and called Chinese people ‚Äúcrackers‚Äù and then a Chinese American person said ‚Äúuh‚Ä¶no, you‚Äôre not using that word right‚Äù and then you said ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre wrong.

I also wanted to share it for folks where gyro might not be an option; for example, some people have tremors or get easily motion-sick from it.",SteamDeck

jha2hc3,"I remember the first time I saw ""boomer shooter"" I thought it was meant to be insulting, but then gave it a second thought and realised it would be absurd to think so many people are using this term to put down a genre of games lol.

Before this, we had ""old school shooter"" and ""Doom clone"", and ""boomer shooter"" to me just sounds like a funnier way of saying both. Maybe it's not accurate as people are pointing out, but neither was ""doom clone"", and as time goes on, neither would ""old school shooter"".",SteamDeck

exfat or

(exfat preferably, as both MacOS and linux have no problems reading it.)

apfs = APPLE File System (ring a bell?)

Also, I would not do it that way. Because when MacOS copies files to external storage media it ads a bunch of metadata files (files with ._ in front of them) to the storage medium, that macos uses but that can not be stored on other file systems ""as part of the actual file"".

So now you run into the problem that when you tranfer them over, you actually have double the amounts of files, half of which are useless on a linux system.

I'd use samba or sftp for example:
https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#how-do-i-transfer-files-to-my-steam-deck - because when transfering using those, no additional metadata files get created by MacOS.

Or because I'm lazy, I use a windows virtual machine on MacOS (using parallels) (could also be a linux one), to copy files to external media, so I dont get those metadata files (._filename.txt).

There are also cleaners for those metadata files (some in script form, others simple Programs on MacOS), but that would be an extra step and I'm lazy.

jhb3n6v,"Step 1: Install emudeck. Since you've got emudeck already, you're good here. Emudeck would've created a bunch of folders either on your internal drive or your SD card depending on what you selected when you installed it.

Step 2: Acquire your ROMs and PS3 bios files. Nobody here can tell you where to get these, because it's piracy.

Step 3: Once you have your bios files and roms, put your files in the relevant folders. For bios files that's emulation -> bios (you can just dump the bios files there loose, no need to put them in their own folder or anything). For roms that's emulation -> roms -> ps3.

Step 4: Run the emudeck installer again, select tools, select steam rom manager.

Step 5: Select preview up in the corner of SRM.

Step 6: Select parse down on the bottom of SRM.

Step 7: Select save. (You can also deselect roms/emulators you don't want added to steam before you hit save if you want.)

Step 8: Go back to gaming mode.

Step 9: Launch RPCS3.

Edit: Here's where it gets a little tricky. I wasn't aware of this since it's been awhile since I did PS3 emulation, I was getting thrown off by my much greater experience with PS2 emulation lol. 

Step 10. From within RPCS3, go to file -> install firmware, and navigate to the firmware file you downloaded (should be in a .pup format).

Step 11. Still from within RPCS3, go to file -> install packages/raps/edats. You'll want to use this function to install the rom's files. Should be a .pkg and a .rap file. 

Step 12. Now you should be able to play.",SteamDeck

The Steam Deck is amazing for gaming on the go, but it is targeted at a particular audience, and you should evaluate if you belong to that audience.

At your age I remember gaming for hours in my gaming pc, there was no Steam Deck back then but there were other portable devices which I owned, and I never gave more playtime to those devices compared to the hundreds of hours I spent on my PC.

If you have a particular need to be constantly on the go and not able to game in your house, then the Steam Deck is definitely the answer, I‚Äôd say 90% of the people who own a Steam Deck use it on their work commute, while they are deployed, on the bed with their SO, because they have to take care of their kids or something similar but I can‚Äôt see how a 14 yo would have any of those problems and if that‚Äôs the case id strongly advise you to focus on upgrading your current PC, grow your steam library bigger and when those problems arise and you have so little time for yourself that you need to game on the go in order to even be able to continue gaming, then there will be a new Steam Deck version with better hardware that you will be able to buy.

jhaxp6l,Delete Proton files,SteamDeck
jhay528,"When switching proton compatibility layers, sometimes, but not always (its actually kind of rare) a compatdata folder can corrupt.

Compatdata folder = prefix folder (just another way of saying it)

What the compatdata folder is, is the fake windows install folder that gets created per game.

But because its the Fake windows install folder, the save files are also in there.

So find out how to backup your save files from there (cloud backup is one thing, but when you have hundreds of hours in a game you batter make sure you have them in your hands...). Then delete compatdata folder.

Then install again.

The thing for you to know is that sometimes switching proton versions will corrupt the fake windows install folder.

I'm not giving you folderpaths, because depending on what you used to install the game, they are different.

compatdata folder location is the search term for steam installs of the game

prefix folder location for lutris or heroic installs.

Also make sure that you have enabled ""show hidden files and folders in the linux file explorer"".

Also zshadercachekiller can nuke the compatdata folder, but first, make sure you got your saves.",SteamDeck

/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/THENNUMBEREDFOLDER (one compatfolder per game)

Game files folder:
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/THENNAMEDFOLDER


Game files folder can also be in a steamapps folder on you sdcard, if you installed the game on sdcard. Compatdata usually will always be in that place on the ssd, except if you used non official tools to move it.

/home/deck/

sometimes is /home/ only

so the way that that works is, that the folder path on the ssd is always /home/deck/

but if you click on home in the linux file explorer, you will be brought to home of the logged in user alredy, which is the user deck.

So you are in /home/deck/ already with no indication that you are.

jhc88t9,"Not to be flippant, but the only way to extend the battery without plugging it into something is to use less power. Cap the frames, drop the quality settings in game, render at a lower resolution, limit TDP, etc. By far, the CPU and GPU consume the most power, so the less those are utilized, the longer the battery will last.

If you have a good internet connection and have a gaming PC or console you can remote play from or a subscription like Game Pass Ultimate or GeForce Now, streaming your games will use significantly less power, and you won't have to sacrifice quality or frame rates either. You can easily get around 6 hours streaming games.",SteamDeck
jhc8kj2,"You should always play while charging, that‚Äôs what keeps your battery lasting a long time.

Your battery life is determined by charge cycles, that is, how many times you can charge it and run it dead.  If you do that all the time, you‚Äôre killing your battery faster.

You should only play off the battery when you have to.

That said, turn down brightness, turn off Bluetooth, turn down the power and GPU when playing less demanding games, etc, etc.",SteamDeck
jhc8mwl,"Capping your framerate is probably the biggest energy save you can do that won't affect your play much at all, you can cap it at a very nice 40fps (way better than 30fps in my opinion) if you manually set the refresh rate of the screen to 40 instead of 60 then turn on the FPS cap and it should now have a 40fps option. Also I would suggest turning on ""allow tearing"" since it should get rid of any input delay coming from the capped framerate. Also make sure to *NOT* use vsync or framerate caps that are *in game* if possible.

Second way might affect your game some more and require some testing and tweaking, and that's limiting how much power your game is allowed to use by using the TDP limit function. If you're playing lighter games, you can tell it to limit it down to the lowest value you can go that won't have much of an effect, but it's going to differ from game to game.

Third way is to simply lower the brightness of the screen, it won't amount to much but you can squeeze some extra power by not playing at as high of a brightness",SteamDeck

In Steam (desktop mode) you want to click the Games menu then click Add a Non Steam Game to my library. Click Browse and find the installer exe, probably in your Downloads folder unless you picked somewhere else to put it.

The other thing you need to do for this step is  tell Steam to use Proton, which can translate some Windows-specific code to code SteamOS can use. Right click on your new shortcut (should be the name of the exe right now) and choose properties. Under Compatibility, click the drop down and choose Proton 8 (I think it's Proton 8.0-1 right now).

You can change the shortcut name from inside the Properties window (Step 4). Then follow step 5 either by downloading the controller template I provided or by choosing the base ""keyboard and mouse"" controller configuration (which you can then edit later).

So... yeah right now isn't exactly great. It's not unplayable, but it's inconsistent. I'd still consider it at least worth keeping an eye on both games though. My experiences with Infinite season 2 and MCC's campaigns were solid enough that I'm still here recommending these games to people.

Edit: Just to get an idea of what it's like, I grabbed my Deck and played a game of Fiesta. The Deck crashed a bunch for about 10 minutes and then I got into my game. Locked 60FPS with no hitches during gameplay despite every player at one point running around with a rocket launcher.",SteamDeck
jhci8i2,"Agreed, it is absolutely a disadvantage in the MCC due to how all 5 multiplayer games are designed around a strong aim assist system. In Halo Infinite, keyboard and mouse players were given aim assist as an experiment to see how it affected the meta.

jhaoyyi,"To be honest I don‚Äôt think you can.  Every time you add a new non-steam game it gets assigned a new autogenerated gameID number.  If steam can‚Äôt find an existing prefix with that ID it assumes it‚Äôs a new install and creates a new prefix for you.  I suppose in theory you could try renaming the old prefix folder to have the new gameID number, but I would kinda expect that would break things quite badly.

To ‚Äùfix‚Äù this, and to avoid similar issues for gog games in the future I would suggest ditching gog galaxy and using the heroic games launcher instead.  It‚Äôs an unofficial linux games launcher for the GOG/Epic games stores.  You can install it from the discover app in desktop mode.  You can then use another application called boilr ( also installable in discover ) to create shortcuts in steam for the gog game prefixes managed by heroic.  Because steam sees these as linux shortcuts (  eg// run com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl heroic://launch/123456 ) it does not try to create any new prefixes for them, so you can add/remove the shortcuts at will.

If you do decide to take this route, just make sure to backup any saves you may have before deleting the old prefix.",SteamDeck
jhay9cv,"Deleting the link is what killed it.

What you need to do is the following:

Take your installer, add it as a non steam game. Run it with some proton version. This will install the game.

Then you go to the ""non-steam game"" you added and change its target from the setup/installer exe to the game exe that you installed, via the 'properties' menu of the game in steam in desktop mode. You'll need protontricks to easily find the right prefix with the game exe, or you can do it manually.

This way it all stays in one prefix, nice and accessible.

I'm not 100% sure how well gog galaxy will work with this, but in theory you should do it the same way. Add galaxy installer as a non-steam game. Install it, then change the non-steam game's target from the galaxy installer to the galaxy exe.

Alternatively, you can use heroic or lutris to get gog games, or bottles to install gog galaxy.",SteamDeck
jhb9fk0,the launch parameter STEAM\_COMPAT\_DATA\_PATH fixes that. see other comment.,SteamDeck
jhb5oto,"Thank you :)

I got it running!

All in desktop mode:

A) Install GOG Galaxy

A.1) Download and add GoG Galaixe installer to steam and choose a recent proton version

A.2) Execute and Install GOG Galaixe & when done install your game

B) Add the games executable as game

B.1) Go to your games install location, select the exe and choose ""add to steam""

B.2) In steam, select your newly added game, goto options

B.3) go to Shortcut-LaunchOptions and enter:`STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=""/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/<game-app-id>"" %command%`

The game-app-id is generic and you need to find out your local one by looking into the parent directory of the path.

This option enables your link to be used within anothers proton directories (e.g. from the gog install)

B.4) Enable a recent proton version (""compatibility"")

C) Launch your game in gaming mode! Respect the Controler Settings as steam probably selects the wrong template and nothing works.

&#x200B;

It may be easier to download the standalone installer executable from GOG and use this one for installing. But i didnt do this yet.

jhbgb5s,"The amounts of times my goodwill was misused on the internet its not even being able to be articulated.

Lets just say I helped 10.000s of people on the internet, on some projects longterm, I got nothing in return for it - and then I started to be a partly a dick about it.

Because I started to understand, that the people who were valuable to me in any sense - are not the people out there with a ""help me longterm"" attitude. :)

Its mostly the people that have stoped replying to low efforts posting entirely.

And thats in every field I entered. (Some without prior experience.)

So be nice to people who are new to a scene? Sure. I get the sentiment, and the concept behind it.

Always be on your best ""customer is always right and I should have been polite"" behavior, when you even would have to fake it?

No chance. In H-E-doublehockeysticks.

Low effort postings are a thing. Let me farm out ""project I want done"" to the internet is a thing. Abusive attitudes in people who always think, they can just request services, or quality answers without ever reaching the ability to giving anything back on their own - is a thing.

As in thats the normal outcome.

Because of one simple apect.

Social reciprocity breaks on the internet, because people dont know each other as small nit communities, so no one remembers the next persons face, or name and everyone just treats the next person in a ""free to exploit manner"".

So now enter online communities, set up to give you entirely made up point rankings, to give you dopain rushes, to do that stuff for free. Companies moving product support out to ""support communites"" using unpaid labor, and entire companies, that only build structures, for people to provide content in, and sells ads against it... Those business models exist. In practice and on paper (business plans).

And you might start to understand, why sometimes, I choose to be a dick...

Because what I'm handing out is not for sale. Its not a service a company or anyone could pay for. Because I do it for one motivation only and that is knowing that other people will learn stuff and then be able to teach others -- which btw. doesnt happen often, but for the few cases it does - doing so is worth it.

Oh and ""dont worry, if you dont feel like it, someone else will answer that question, because everyone is out there and sharing"" is a highly idealized concept, that mostly holds true for three months after early adopters get their hands on a thing, and the community is still growing.",SteamDeck

He makes A LOT of valid points.",SteamDeck
jhbsuov,"Actually no.

Its about sustained output. Of as many informed people as possible, over time.

So, you are correct, getting something in return on an individual level is something you can forget entirely, when dealing in those settings with the public at large. :)

What I'm describing as ""everyone is just out there to exploit the best person for their needs from their perspective"" is just normal behavior. I'm only mentioning it, because ""best person for their needs"" is not an unlimited resource, and allocation far more challenging than ""the universe will make it happen semi perfectly, there is karma"".

As in there is a point where quality of information usually plummets once information based communities leave their growing phase.

So there are two outcomes, either you see that the exploitation factor is high and you stop entirely. Or you ignore it for the benefit of people that might still learn and grow.

And then there is the position of someone looking and this starting to question how they could make the information flow better here, and coming to the conclusion, that if they reduce ""misuse"" (by scolding low effort questions, sometimes (overdoing is a problem)), they can keep the people actually willing to share higher quality information in the loop for longer, benefiting everyone.

Because to not see the exploitation, and the people burning out because of it, or just leaving, is simply not possible. You can ignore it. Or you can try to minimize it.

Also the tendency to overdo it is there - so what you do (balancing that) is valuable as well.

The point where I still have a conceptual problem is -- how do deal with information communities that jumped the shark entirely - so those that start to disseminate wrong information because the ""whats best"" and ""ego"" and ""most easy crowd"" took over. :)

There the right decision often is ""just leave them be"" - and I still find it very hard to do. As in I kind of cant. So when (personally perceived as) wrong recommendations get put out there, I still have the inclination to double my efforts.

Where you are right is, that if you want to elongate the growth phase of an information community - you'd do what you and every PR person in the world is promoting.

Just never pronounce anything to be anything other, than everyone is valuable to us, and we are friendly and welcoming, from whatever vantage point you want to shout it into the public.

Also ""spiraled"", and contemplated those aspects almost philosophically  are still two different things.

And actually, the more I think about it, the less I actually value the ""mass growth"" aspect of any information economy community concept.

Let the people grow who actually are interested and show promise. I'm not doing this for the lowest common denominator. (Youtuber popularity, or what someone can then put into a ""whats best way to"" posting, when reiterating part of it).

That said my deck is undervolted with a slight bump on the CPU to 3.7ghz instead of 3.5.

I generally go for battery life so I underclocked the GPU and limited the TDP.

I can't go nearly as far as him with undervolting so I max out at -25mv but it seems to make a huge difference. Similar to him in that it gets around 3 hours if not a bit more of battery life and runs perfectly at 30fps for the most part.

A slight bump in CPU frequency seems to help a lot, however going much higher makes it use a lot more power and get very very hot.

I do worry about people bricking their deck though, you have to be so careful going up in 5mv increments and testing for instability first. I could also never get the CPU up to 4Ghz, I tried for Warzone in Windows and even with fanspeed at 100% and GPU usage super low and underclocked it would be pushing 100C as for some reason the CPU seems to heat up way more than the GPU, something to do with the chip layout I imagine!",SteamDeck

The performance overhead is worth it because you can run the game with 10% less base resolution and still get better fidelity for virtually the same hardware demands. Gen 5 would have saved a LOT of Unreal titles like the infamous NMH III on Switch.

As an example, *Bright Memory Infinite* is an Unreal title that uses Gen 5 TAA and it runs excellently on Deck at 50% res upscaled. People at r/FuckTAA tend to hate on Gen 4 TAA, but Gen 5 TAA has resolved and addressed most of their complaints considering BMI (heh) actually gets praise from them.

like I've tried to explain why RDR2 has performance issues when using 4GB vram in bios which is simply the fact the game wants to use 12GB of ram for the CPU which it can't do because as far as the system is concerned it only has around 11GB at that point. but people like to pass this off as a ""bug"".  if anything people should be setting vram to 256MB to allow the system optimum usage of ram.

I've also tried to explain why turning off memory defragging can reduce performance and even increase ram usage which again falls on deaf ears.

don't tell me you really think an SSD is faster than Ram. its not even comparable. pushing ram to the disk is MUCH slower and only meant to be used when your ram is limited which is not the case for the steam deck nor would it ever improve performance its just a crutch that sacrifices performance for pseudo ram. turning down swappiness is what improves performance because it GREATLY reduces the usage of the swap file to almost nothing",SteamDeck
jh78mh8,while faster than HDD their logic is to use it to replace ram which the speeds are not even comparable. like the logic cryo spreads around is to limit the ram with the 4GB bios setting then use the swap file to supplement it for the cpu.

jh7aqxq,"* Reclaiming memory also has a cost. Not be able to reclaim anon pages (process memory) on demand could make the kernel work harder to try to figure out what to claim. Kind of like how an empty modern SSD is faster than an almost full one.
* For streaming-heavy games evicting too much file backed pages might actually cause rising IO pressure depending on how the game is designed.
* LRU might be able to relieve some of the problems regarding to swapping out hot pages. It's not perfect but it's also not always ""we have to keep everything in memory"".

But again, it's very complicated and different games tend to react differently to memory management policies. Stick to the default at least gives you a predictable set to work with, but blindly adopting untested ""better defaults"" might do more harm than good.",SteamDeck

jh7cbiv,">Swappiness decides when data is moved from RAM to the swap file, which by default, was always.

LMAO wrong. Swappiness decides how much anonymous pages (simply put: process memory) can be swapped out compare to file pages (opened files) when memory pressure rises, and the default is 50-50. There's also some algorithm in place to avoid hot pages so there's better chance that it would swap out pages that don't matter immediately to the game.

Keep in mind that stutters can still occur when the kernel tries harder to figure out what pages can be reclaimed when there's less viable candidates for it to work with, and that throw away hot file pages can sometimes cause problems too when e.g. the game streams heavily.",SteamDeck
jh7d0gr,so you can't explain anything then? nor comprehend that cryo claims a swap file improves performance while greatly reducing its usage due to the fact a swap file will hurt performance,SteamDeck
jh7cvbq,"while I get what you are saying Most games in general do not want or need to use over 16GB in almost every case you just dump the cache that fills the free space and its meant to be dumped on request without hampering performance.

I've tested both on disk swap as well as zram (which for those that don't know is a much faster swap block in the ram itself) and on disk swap either provides no difference or hurts performance while zram makes no change at all regardless if 1 swappiness or 200 swappiness because it isn't harmed by that like on disk swap is

I've also tested every vram setting and games will use the same amount of vram regardless of the setting and get the same performance. the issue starts when you start to starve the CPU as in the case of Red Dead Redemption 2 but otherwise the only difference is 256MB gives the system more ram to work with overall.",SteamDeck
jh7do0g,">while I get what you are saying Most games in general do not want or need to use over 16GB in almost every case you just dump the cache that fills the free space and its meant to be dumped on request without hampering performance.

Pressure isn't just % usage. It would also cover the cases when e.g. the game suddenly tries to allocate a huge chunk of memory or when the kernel tries to shift memory around for whatever reasons.

I'm not sure if it's important, but I made sure to have Steam format the SD card and put at least 1 game on the new card before moving anything.

I can play it with or without  connection.",SteamDeck
jhal14h,"As long as I start it up *with* an online connection, after I'm in game it doesn't matter. Certain things that require online will timeout and give you an error message but you can play the game just fine otherwise. Playing AC Valhalla right now and the online connection does not recover from standby.",SteamDeck
jharaoc,"DRM's a bitch.

You own nothing, and you will be happy.

Especially when it comes to AAA publishers like Ubisoft, EA, etc that's the level of ""service"" you buy.

Supposedly, they require you to go online every x amount of time, but even then it's not 100% accurate and as you've seen.",SteamDeck
jhaj26m,"Not that I have tried offline mode for Ubisoft Connect on the Steam Deck, but on PC this is not correct. There is an [offline play mode](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/running-ubisoft-connect-pc-in-offline-mode/000063188). This is the same kind of check that Steam has, which requires you to run the game at least once while connected, before being able to play the game in offline mode. The difference I have noticed, is the game might ctd if you lose connection mid-game on Ubisoft Connect, where a game in Steam will continue to work.

Most of the most current games require always online-play for all functionality, but a lot of the older SP-focused titles (like _Odyssey_) should be available offline. Generally these are SP-focused or SP-only titles originally released on uPlay prior to the switch to Ubisoft Connect and the launch of Ubisoft Plus.

I have played most of the Ubisoft games I own in offline mode on my desktop PC, including _Assassin's Creed Odyssey_. The only game I had an issue with not playing was _FarCry 6_ trial, as it wouldn't work in-game if it couldn't connect to Ubisoft Connect, despite being verified and activated prior to launch.",SteamDeck
jhcjpo1,"I'm not super familiar with the new ubi app, so I wasnt aware of this.

I dont think the old one had this feature. I've taken my desktop system a few places and haven't been able to play the ubi games because it needed to sign in and couldn't do that offline. 

It's interesting that those are the games that work offline now.",SteamDeck
jhejj2c,"uPlay had the same thing, but you had to sign in online first and it would ""provision"" offline play for a bit. I believe Steam requires online sign-in every 30 days (?), but it feels like Ubisoft Connect is much, much shorter. 

The biggest issue with the Ubisoft app and provisioning/authentication (and why we see a lot of ""can't you actually remember me?"" type post), is that it ties your authentication to your computer _and_ your location (IP address). If you have a dynamic IP, use a VPN, or go somewhere else and login, it immediately de-authorizes all other logged in states, forcing you to login and ""remember my pc"" next time you are home, online, VPN, etc.",SteamDeck

Fortunately I've barely left the house in the past 3 years, so all of that is not a huge problem.

Also, the on-screen keyboard sucks, and desktop mode is a pain in the ass unless you're using an external mouse and keyboard.

Sometimes solutions are succinct, some are also viable alternatives, but some overcomplicate as much as they fix.  The good ones do stand out and get more word of mouth praise.

But you'll rely on these community projects to a fault and tolerate a likely possibility of unexpected incompatibility because the immense scope tackled by multiple asynchronized  pieces.  Also free, so beggars can't be choosers. But that could be said of any immature OS.  There is less opporunity to sit on an older static OS version with automatic updates on restart.

\- Sticks are too slippery, and too stiff, not precise enough for tiny camera movement, also the fact that they passed Q&A with all the click/crunch and other noise issue because of the sensor cable inside is baffling me.

\- The D pad is meh at best.

\- The screen is just bad, color are too blueish, not enough contrast, too much bleed, I understand that this is probably the part where they cut the most for the price, but it's just low tier, I've seen cheap mobile phone from Aliexpress or some 10y old TN screen with much better screen.

\- Back button are too hard to press if you don't put something on it to make them bigger

\- The keyboard is a pain to use, slow, sluggish, same goes for the touch screen.

\- The OS still need some polish, I don't know if it's because of my large steam library but it lag very often.

I know that Valve is constantly improving the software, which is a major plus. Nevertheless, I hope that the Steam Deck 2 will be constructed with better attention to detail. It may sound like I'm being overly critical, but its really not that bad as it sounds. There are just a few minor issues that I've noticed: The trigger spring sometimes makes a sound, while the joysticks feel sticky and produce a slight noise at the center. Additionally, the casing tends to crackle a bit when pressure is applied in certain directions. Although this isn't a major issue, it's something that most devices with plastic casings of this size would likely experience.

jh35xll,"How dare you attempt to limit me to only one complaint about the Deck!

Here's my 'Whine List':

* **OSK.** Still kinda sucks really. It's a LOT more tolerable now we got the few changes Valve made to improve it, but it's still got a long way to go before it could ever be as good to use as something like a phone touchscreen on Android. For a start it's often too slow, and the lack of any kind of predictive text makes it feel very clunky. I mean, I know enough about how this all works to know that I definitely don't blame Valve for the lack of predictive text, obviously that's not possible when using the keyboard in games for example, but it's still annoying.
* **Battery life.** The battery life is excellent for what the Deck does. But just because it's excellent, doesn't mean I can't still complain about it! Because while it's excellent, my internal spoiled brat is stomping her foot on the floor and saying, 'But why can't I have 20 hours straight battery life while playing GTA V!'.
* **Laggy UI Issues.** Particularly on the 'Collections' screen. It's obvious the UI is generating the thumbnails for each collection from scratch each time and not caching them. The result is about a 1 second long frame drop for me as it attempts to generate thumbnails for a dozen collections and a few hundred games.
* **No 'Screen Off' Button.** We have an off button. I want a 'screen off' button. Keeps games running, keeps the whole Deck running, just turns off the screen and mutes the audio. I don't know how this could possibly work in a way which won't be confusing to users and result in a bunch of misuse and battery life disasters, but it's still something I want, because I want to be able to turn off the Deck's screen when I need to leave it somewhere downloading a game for 30 minutes, it just feels wrong leaving the screen unchanging showing a progress bar for 30 minutes, like it's going to cause screen burnin or something.

Understandably the biggest complaint I might have for the Deck however is just the general 'bugginess' of the whole software stack. It's becoming less a Deck specific issue and more just a general familiar level of bugginess that Valve has in a lot of their software. They make incredible things which I love but they often get things about '90% stable' and seem to start working on the next incredible thing and forget to polish the experience of what they already made.

But no that's not my biggest complaint.

Nor is my biggest complaint just the manner in which Valve just seems very inconsistent and low-attention-span in their management. Like for example, in the first launch months of the Deck, they started doing monthly update videos. We got one each month for the first 2 months, then another at the 4 month mark then nothing for a long time, then one at the 12 month mark. It's like someone said 'We should do monthly update videos', then they got to the 4 month mark and said 'Nah this is boring'.

But no that's not my biggest complaint either.

My biggest complaint is... This is my favourite gaming device of all time and I can't spend 24/7 on it because I have to sleep, eat and work for most hours of each day. :(",SteamDeck

jh3ovwj,"My big three.

Controller Support, at least with playable, not verified, games.  It's a nuisance but not a deal breaker but sucks how older games are like 'press [button1], press [mouse1], press [E]' and you basically need to memorize your controller mapping, worse is when the game doesn't support mapping of all functions in the game unlike the game's console side version, but that's a nitpick.

Battery Life, which is fixed with a portable battery, buy a third party deck clip + battery to attach it to, boom, 8 hour battery life, plus I don't mind the weight.  But standalone, that battery life defeats the portable idea.

Incompatibility issues with more modern 'service' games.  I'm talking about Ubisoft connect, anti-cheat, game launchers being required.  Standard steam deck needs a good deal of work arounds for some games.

2. Battery Life -  The battery is too small for anyone who wants to play AAA games for any length of time on the decck.

* Bluetooth device connections aren't in the right-hand sidebar overlay, which makes zero sense to me. I should *not* have to dive into device settings to connect my headphones when they don't auto-connect (Bluetooth Decky Loader plugin to the rescue for this one).
* The trigger buttons don't hard click like the Steam Controller.
* The virtual keyboard could definitely use a bit of work; it's almost certainly user error, but I always end up accidentally opening the accent overlay thing on keys when I try to capitalize a letter... it feels clunky enough that I frequently end up poking the keyboard onscreen instead of using the pads.
* Navigating the store on Deck is a *pain*; it's slow, the front store page frequently fails to entirely load or just wigs out, and I'm not a bit fan of the layout of individual game pages on the store on Deck

jh141v0,"The dock/undock experience. It's such a pain in the ass. Sometimes it just works and it's magic, but more often I'll put the Deck in the dock and the Deck's screen will go dark but the monitor won't wake up. Or the monitor will wake up and just display a black screen. I unplug the dock to try again and the Deck stays dark for like 5-10 seconds, so I have to wait. Then it lights up and I plug it back in. Sometimes it'll work the second try, sometimes it'll do the same shit, sometimes it will connect and work...but at the wrong resolution or refresh rate.

SteamOS doesn't seem to remember the settings you assigned to each monitor, either. It does in Desktop mode, but in Game mode I seemingly have to set my monitor to the right settings every time. This is a huge pain in the ass because one of my monitors is 1440p 165hz, but the deck can only do 1440p 120hz...but it STILL TRIES 165hz and gets stuck at a black screen. I have to go in and turn on monitor safe mode, then connect the monitor, then set it to 1440p 120hz, then it's fine. Until the next time I connect it, I have to do the same shit again.

I know we're all tired of Switch comparisons but I can jackhammer the Switch into and out of the dock rapid fire and it connects and displays instantly, it switches back to the device screen instantly. Over and over, 100% reliably, it just works every time. Plus Switch games can have different performance profiles for docked and undocked and again, swap between them instantly every time. Audio also always goes to the right place without having to make sure ""External Device"" is selected, because seemingly at random my Deck will decide to use its own speakers instead.

And this isn't limited to one dock or monitor, I've tried it with a bunch of different monitors and a bunch of different TVs. I've used just plain usb-c to hdmi/displayport cables, I've used fancy docks, I've used cheap ones, I own the *official dock*, and they all run into the same bullshit.

This also glosses over issues with screen aspect and scaling. I've pretty much given up on smoothly using my Deck in the same way I use my Switch. Whenever I think about docking it I just remember how much of a pain it is and don't bother. I really hope this improves.",SteamDeck

2) most modern game are not optimized for 720p(800p even more so). Frequently you get terrible aliasing, and no antialiasing can save you. Also the games are making more computation than needed at that resolution, resulting in hot AF system with terrible performance. 
1) one nvme 2230 slot is not enough. Would be nice to have at least 2280. Even better 2280 + 2.5

And yeah, I realise it will make the deck big AF. I'm Okay with it having a 9-10 inch screen, just make it at least 900p, ideally 1800p. And yeah, the cost will probably be twice or thrice that of the steam deck. For series s performance in your hand? Totally worth it xD",SteamDeck

That maybe a ridiculous thing to ask for but ironically when I got the switch I knew this device was designed to be used by children compared to the vita that probably was also designed for kids, but it felt like a stylish piece of premium tech (possibly due to size and relative heft), where as if the deck was that hefty, would probably be ergonomically horrible for it's size.",SteamDeck

Sometimes I need to exit a game or bring up the settings menu before it'll recognize the connection. And, of course, sometimes it works perfectly.

* No standby downloads

* Screen is pretty bad. Not the resolution, but contrast and colorspace. I shouldn't have to download a plugin to somewhat remedy it. Don't get me started on backlight bleed.

* Software issues galore. Games needing tweaking to work (maybe at all), menus not showing up at the right time, controller inputs changing while in standby, etc.

* The fan is kinda loud.

* Starting MSRP is definitely not $400 and people need to stop acting like it is. At minimum, you're paying for a 256GB or 512GB microSD card to complement the 64GB storage. If you're more inclined, you're buying a used drive off of eBay for $50~$55. Regardless, $450 is more accurate though it seems a lot of people opt for the 256GB or 512GB Decks anyway.

* The community, partially. If you have a problem, you're very likely able to find a solution through some forum or avenue. However, there's just waaaaay too much hugboxxing for any real discussion. r/SteamDeck is particularly guilty of this, with any mention of the negatives being heavily downvoted or swarms of user rushing to the defense about their flawless experiences with the device.

This thing has been a huge pain in the butt for me.

Sometimes the screen flickers black then back on, sometimes it flickers black then turns green, and sometimes the TV screen just turns black. The latter two I have to re-do all the previous steps. I'm used to the switch where it's literally as simple as ""Drop it in the dock, and you're done.""

Yes, the dock has updated firmware that was supposed to fix the charging cable issue. There's no pending updates and I can't find a way to force it to re-update.

2. Not being able to download while locked/away at work

jh1g3yq,"Bluetooth on this thing is fundamentally bad and I do not understand why it doesn't get more coverage. There's inherent bluetooth input lag with every single device that makes using a wireless controller while docked (or anything, really) an absolute pain. If you're the type of person who needs Game Mode to play on a TV, you'll be endlessly frustrated by the input lag. On top of that, all of my devices have a ton of difficulty connecting to the Deck. My keyboard takes multiple tries, all of my controllers take multiple tries, it's an utter pain in the ass.

I have zero clue why they designed the Deck thumbsticks the way they did - they're destined to grind down over time on the edges of the plastic, and my left stick is already showing some pretty serious wear over the course of the past year-ish of using mine.

The fundamental experience of browsing through Steam on the Steam Deck in SteamOS mode, to this day, is *still* filled with inconsistencies and bugs, ranging from sound not working on some screens, to input working in strange ways on other screens. It feels so cheap that the Deck will slow down while scrolling through my library.

For no reason that I can pick up, sometimes my Steam Deck just fails to wake up from sleep the first few times I hit the button, and other times it'll wake up, but only some of the inputs will work for a bit before everything works. Or it'll crash when I wake it up.

Offline mode doesn't track my playtime.

I don't blame Valve for this one - but the sheer number of workarounds that are needed for some games to just work is frustrating. It's so demoralizing to try and play a game only to realize that it just isn't going to cooperate with the Steam Deck for reasons outside your control.

When you have a lot of small patches to download, some of the patches are randomly scheduled, but the scheduled ones are at the bottom of the list. If you try to scroll down to queue them up, when the current download finishes, the list index resets to the top, so you basically can't just queue them all up at once and then let them finish.

The system for finding where your game data is installed vs save data is impenetrable and requires additional apps that give hints as to where they are, instead of making them easy to access at a click.

If you wait too long to update your flatpaks, the Discover app hangs on update unless you disable wifi, reboot, then re-enable wifi. It's the most ridiculous bug.

There are audio issues that happen if you go into sleep mode while a game is running. It gets all crackly and bad.

I dunno if they ever fixed this, but I believe there was a bug where it would treat non-steam apps as steam games, and not let you run one on the steam deck while your PC was playing a steam game.

This is rough for my use case - I don‚Äôt commute for work or anything since I work from home, so my primary use case is couch gaming controller games on a whim, whereas most other gaming is done at my desktop. Picking it up to use and finding the battery is toast is a pain.

For example, I was trying to play metal gear solid rising: revengeance.

Game crashing, tv screen randomly flickering while playing, I have to mess with display settings so the game loads onto the correct screen, If I unplug the HDMI cable while playing, several Steam OS services will strait up crash and I have to restart steam deck etc.

The list of problems became so substantial, I ended up hauling my laptop with all of it's accessories instead of trying to deal with the nightmare that is playing a game on steam os desktop mode.

Those panels are being used by companies like Anbernic with their 2023 OLED handhelds. Trust me, you don't want to use a 2012 cheap OLED panel in 2023. 

The Switch OLED uses a modern OLED panel, and it doesn't suffer from noticeable black smearing. But to reach the price point, it's using a B grade panel filled with issues *and* instead of an individual calibration step, Nintendo preloads a default curve that only truly matches the display at 50% and 100% brightness, causing a lot of artifacts to appear.

From what I've heard, some publishers are quite uncomfortable with the idea of game retailers like Steam having so much power and control over how their games launch, which has driven companies like Paradox Interactive to develop their own launcher. It just seems to me that the market is incentivizing publishers to have their own launchers and therefore the best outcome for consumers would be for said launchers to exist in a framework where they operate and integrate smoothly alongside retailer launchers.

It used to have pretty bad reviews about its HDMI output, but then I checked again and they were gone. I haven't used it for its HDMI output yet. But it works well for extra USB. I use it with this ancient 100 Mb/s Ethernet dongle I originally bought for my Wii U and it works great for that.

Farming Sim 22 (Playable) is co-op, you can farm together.

For life sims and harvest-moon-likes my GF and I were enjoying Stardew Valley (Verified) as well as Dinkum (Playable, early access). Traveller's Rest (Verified, early access) is also a fun one, focusing on running a tavern.

2D side-scrolling exploration base-building RPG: Terraria (Verified) is a blast with more than one person, and there's an absolute ton of things to do and reasons to replay over and over again. Get into mods (via tmodloader) and you'll never see the light of day again cuz you'll be too busy playing Terraria! ;)

If you want a Diablo-esque twin-stick co-op shooter, The Ascent (Verified) is a fun cyberpunk romp through a decaying arcology.

Sandbox space exploration: Astroneer (Playable) is a fun builder/explorer. It's really cute and the UI is all in-universe.

Sandbox space exploration: No Man's Sky (Verified) is a labour of love, and a great experience flying with a friend. I don't think you can start together, but after getting to the anomaly you can meet up very easily and explore together after that. Very freeform, so you'd have to work together to plan what you want to do.

Looter shooters: Borderlands series (Playable) are looter shooters, first two games are great but they cashed in and wrecked the story in the third in my opinion. I'd recommend 2, or 3 if you don't give a shit about story.

Fantasy Looter shooter: Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (Verified) way more engaging, plot-wise than BL3. Makes a metric butt-ton of tabletop gaming jokes. Enjoyed it a lot with my girlfriend, ended up both enjoying it far more than BL3.

Classic-ish RPG: Divinity Original Sin 1&2 (Verified) are classic RPGs so if you're fans of any pen-and-paper games you might dig these.

2D side-scrolling colony survival: Kingdom Two Crowns (Verified) and later in the series entries too. They're really atmospheric games that have a good amount of puzzles and secrets to find as you grow your settlement and defend it.

Monster hunting: Monster Hunter Rise (Playable) is a... monster hunting game. You wield big heckin' weapons and fight a huge roster of progressively larger creatures. Expect a lot of variety, from hunting small game to small predators to giant fucking winged, lighting-breathing bastards. Really fun to play as a team of up to 4, difficulty is dynamic so it will adjust to just the two of you.

Racing: Need For Speed: Heat (Playable) needs the EA App, fair warning, but it was fun as hell racing on a team with my girlfriend and showing off our customized cars after winning a bunch of money.

Goose: Untitled Goose Game (Honk! (Verified)) is a game about honking and being a horrible goose. You can be horrible geese *together*.

Recommended to me but haven't played them alone or together yet, but folk seem to like em:
- Wolf Quest (Verified) be a wolf, I guess
- Valheim (Verified) viking survival builder, maybe
- Warhammer Inquisitor Martyr & Prophecy (both Playable)",SteamDeck

edit: Adding in that ideally you use borderless fullscreen when you can so you can use the gesture that allows you to switch apps.

The options boil down to carrying a large hub that requires a barrel connector for power or using hdmi+usb to usb c on a smaller usbc dock, but those often have issues with delivering enough power.

I'm waiting for a usbc hub that I can mount to the back that also provides a usb4/usbc dp alt out port. Something like the anker 556 with usb4 out. This is why the deck having 2 of its usbc ports that do everything would be super handy.",SteamDeck

Even if there isn't an outright ""no launchers"" classification for Verified, the launcher would need to provide a seamless experience, basically run in fullscreen, with controller input, and cleanly exit _before_ the game launches and allow the Deck to transition to the game itself.

And Steam doesn't just launch a .exe. it can download mods, launch games with mods, and download/launch betas. Not sure if it also does anything as far as multiplayer configurations in the background. It's kind of hard to separate Steam's launching of games from the rest of Steam, but stuff related to mods definitely stands out to me based on what I've seen in other launchers. 

Also the fact that Steam puts all the games in one easily accessible place, so a user doesn't have to depend on the OS for that (in some cases, I've found that Windows doesn't show me my games in the Start menu).

edit: Adding in that ideally you use borderless fullscreen when you can so you can use the gesture that allows you to switch apps. Easiest way to get into/out of non-Steam games and get to the desktop without relying on setting up controller shortcuts. There's a touch gesture for that in Win 10 and Win 11.",SteamDeck

It is sooooo smooth. Currently maxed out graphics and the HUD is so customizable. Sure you need to redo your layout to crossbar but it's not at all hard to pick up.

Onlllly thing I recommend is get you a little portable keyboard. Because people be blowing you up in dm's and you cannot communicate outside of emote spamming on the SD lmao that pop up keyboard is awfffuuuuulllll but that's a deck thing not a 14 thing.

If you open konsole and paste and run this command:

```bash
du -h -d2 ~ | sort -h
```

It'll output a list of subdirectories that are taking up the most space. You can then replace `~` with the paths of the biggest hogs (_e.g._

```bash
du -h -d2 /home/deck/.var/app/ | sort -h
```

) to continue to drill down.

Of course, that will tell you _where_ the files are, not _what_ they are or how to remove them. But it should at least point you in the right direction.

#### Obligatory explainer 

It's a good rule that you should never paste and run (even non-privileged) commands on any device without understanding what they do, so:

- `du`: disk usage -- it's GNU's disk usage analyzer which reports the amount of space taken up by subdirectories along each given path. The cool thing is that it treats symlinks as files (instead of following them as folders) so you don't end up double- or triple-counting content that's available under multiple paths
- `-h`: make the output human-readible (52.3 GB instead of 54840524) 
- `-dN`: break down to _N_ levels of subdirectories (`-d0` would just tell you the disk usage of the path with no breakdown, FYI) 
- `~`: The UNIX shorthand for your home directly. Equivalent to `/home/deck` but way shorter to type. Provided here as the argument for where `du` is searching
- `|`: ""pipe"" the output from the first command as the input to the second command
- `sort`: what it says on the tin. Sorts the lines of a provided input
- `-h`: Allows `sort` to sort human-readible file sizes (so 12 KB isn't treated as larger than 9 GB)",SteamDeck

When something breaks, like an update, only then try a new version of Proton. It doesn't hurt to just change it first, and see if it fixes. If it doesn't, then try deleting the old Proton prefix, and try again.

Just be wary that some saves and configs are stored in the prefix, so don't delete until you know and then save those files. Use Pcgamingwiki to find out where the saves are.

Setup Tutorial for all of the Dosbox based games:

You can read the setup tutorial for Pandora Directive here, all Dosbox based games (thats all of the games except for Overseer and Tesla Effect) are set up in the same way.:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12iqoeg/issues_with_dosbox_tex_murphy_series/

Setup Tutorial for Overseer:

Tex Murphy: Overseer (4W, FSR 2) 

Finally got it to run.. Minor nightmare.. üôÇ (ProtonDB lists this game as broken.) 
Used Lutris and this Wine version installed into Lutris with Protonup-qt (a fairly recent one with dxvk enabled, edit: lutris-GE-Proton7-43-x86_64). 

CD Version of the game, as the DVD version apparantly doesnt work.
In Lutris click on the plus, add custom game (last entry), Name the game, select the runner (wine), set win32 architecture for the prefix (important), enter the prefix location /home/deck/Games/tex-murphy-overseer  in wine options ticked activate dgvoodoo2 or similar, then ok.

The gag is,that the Game needs to be in a win32 prefix, which with lutris you can only set up at the prefix creation stage. And the default installer detects x64, which is wrong - and then the games installer errors out with win95 or higher error. But if you set win32 at the creation of the prefix (see above, needs to be a custom made one), it gets created in win32 architecture. 
Next, next to play in lutris there is this lollypop icon. Where you can access wine config. In wine config you can set the windows environment to Windows 98 (only available when the prefix was created as win32). then the installer will run. 
From that point forward I didnt run the installer straight away, but followed a cd to dvd tutorial for the game out there (aka nocd) to the T (the one that also tells you to install the 1.04 patch, even created the directories it told me and installed from there). whenever I needed to change the installer, I picked a new exe for the games launch path. In the end I copied over the patched .exe but not the games config .ini yet (nocd tutorial tells you to copy over that file as well, in the end I never did.). Ran the game, then compared the ini settings carefully one by one. (Turns out midi can be left turned on f.e.)

ingame settings double lines on videos, 800x600, and 800x600 windows size, everything in advanced graphics settings checked everything maxed out. 
Mouse cursor flickers. But it isnt a dealbreaker, as you can configure the game to use dual joystick style movement and only need the mouse to interact with things, so you can hide it in the bottom left, when you are not interacting with items, so its only a semi annoyance.

Also the cd to dvd patch works with the german language version of the game as well, although the subtitles then will be english. (Which I prefer. üôÇ ) 

Game crashes pretty frequently every 30 min or so in testing, but then remembers the position prior to crash on your last interaction and starts up very quickly, so I'd say playable. Also I'm not on the latest wine dxvk build, and cxbx also crashed with the one I'm using, so maybe its the wine build. 

edit: Restricting number of cores to 1 in Lutris settings for the game, or moving the installed games location to (fake windows c drive in /home/deck/Games/tex-murphy-overseer/) C:/Overseer/ and not C:/Program Files/Overseer/ (shorter path, no space) may have reduced or solved the frequent crashing issue.

jh5tv4a,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I couldn't stand this game. The constant starting over drove me nuts. It's designed to make you fail over and over. As a matter of fact, that's the only way you can upgrade your equipment and abilities and do better. You *have to* fail continuously in order to get a little bit farther each time.

I want to play games where I can advance on my own skill, not games where you're so weak, you're expected to lose over and over until you've finally built up enough skills, weapons, and abilities to progress to the next level. This game is literal hell for a player like me.",SteamDeck

jh31hq8,"I've put like 83 hours into Hades already.  I finished the main story, and now I'm just constantly playing through it over and over again to see what happens next, and seeing the characters grow and develop is so satisfying.  Not to mention the dungeons and enemy layouts alwaya change every run, and there are several challenges that keep you busy and to test your level of skill.

Don't worry about losing in the beginning because Hades encourages this.  Every run you fail at in the beginning will make you stronger and stronger until you are able to make it to the end with ease.",SteamDeck

If you beat Hades, there is certainly much more dialogue and world building to uncover.

With my friends, it's always a challenge getting someone to put up a zip line exactly where we need it, or drilling a tunnel directly to a goal. Bosco does all of that at your command.",SteamDeck
jh3nyp9,"not sure where the term comes from. but it basically is the gameplay mechanic of doing ‚Äúruns‚Äù trying to play through the whole game/section without dying. once you lose you lose all the loot/power ups and restart from the beginning. 

there are a lot of variations of this though. some let you keep certain upgrades and you continue to power up as you progress. 

there are also games referred as ‚Äúrogue-lite‚Äù which is basically a less forgiving version of this. with more checkpoints and things you keep during runs. 

it‚Äôs a really popular gameplay loop currently and it is fun. very challenging but rewarding at the same time. 

great games i love in this genre recently off the top of my head are hades, returnal, rogue legacy, dead cells, slay the spire, spelunky, the binding of isaac, cult of the lamb, and risk of rain.",SteamDeck
jh4b447,"Rogue**like** means a game where if you die you have to start over with nothing. Think of Tetris or Chess or a card game. You have no ""progression"", every match you start with nothing.

Rogue**lite** means a game where you get reset to level 1 after dying, but there is still *some* progression between matches. Usually you unlock permanent upgrades or unlock new weapons between runs, but you still have to restart back at first level everytime you die.

Hades is the latter. You unlock upgrades and new weapons, but if you die on the fourth level you are sent back to the start of level one to start over. Only you have new upgrades now...",SteamDeck

jh450iy,"**[Roguelike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)** 
 
 >Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing computer games traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Though Beneath Apple Manor predates it, the 1980 game Rogue, which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator, is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring Rogue's character- or sprite-based graphics.

jh9xwd4,"The only scenario i can think of where there could be a big benefit, is if you heavily mod games. Many of them recommend you install them on an SSD to reduce stutter (probably from having to read a ton of loose files from said mods). As a more recent example, Oblivion Rebirth+ notes this explicitly; a mod collection for an old game that normally wouldn't need to be on an SSD. I've also heard texture packs for emulators have reduced stuttering from the increased read times, if that texture pack has like thousands of loose files (even with precaching, which you don't always want to do with limited hardware specs)",SteamDeck

jh7kwyh,"Internal storage on the 64gb model is about as fast as the sd card. 

Shader cache is loaded to the RAM when the game loads, slow storage will only make your load time longer, it won't affect the perfomance.

64gb emmc model performs as well as the ssd models, there's only a very little decrease in the loading times.

Valve do not recommend replacing the internal storage, they want you to use the sd card.

jh7jxlq,Ahh ok then yea I got a good amount almost 20 on the sd card,SteamDeck
jh7qc7n,"Absolutely wrong.

>Internal storage on the 64gb model is about as fast as the sd card. 

The eMMC drive can read at about 400MB/s. The microSD is going to be limited to around 90MB/s. It still makes a difference.

>Shader cache is loaded to the RAM when the game loads, slow storage will only make your load time longer, it won't affect the perfomance.

Shaders are shifted in and out of RAM as needed. They do not necessarily persist there indefinitely. Therefore, drive read time still matters a lot.

>Valve do not recommend replacing the internal storage, they want you to use the sd card.

While true that Valve does not support user storage upgrades, they willingly showed everyone how to do it. You're just on you're own if you do. Regardless, it doesn't change the fact that the 64GB model is not viable out of the box, without upgrading the storage. If you don't want to or can't upgrade the storage yourself, you should get the 256GB model.",SteamDeck
jh7k4yu,Yeah you‚Äôre best bet is to cut that in half. Finish like 4-5 games uninstall and repeat. Might be tedious but it‚Äôs the only way until you upgrade the SSD. Even a 256 one would be good and it‚Äôs cheap,SteamDeck

1. Go to Desktop Mode. Open Steam from it and in the search bar, type in Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime. Make sure this is installed, sometimes it doesn't install correctly with EAC-based games and that causes issues like yours (phantom EAC, where it lets you in then boots.)

2. Delete your prefix for Halo MCC. A prefix is the little bottle your game's settings are stored in and sometimes they don't respond correctly to you adding EAC support. I know for Fall Guys, I had to wipe my prefix before it would recognize the added support. You just have to click start over the game, go to Developer and Delete Proton Files. If this isn't present, go to System Settings and Enable Developer mode.

3. Now, in game properties,go to Compatibility and force the user of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool. Make sure you're using the LATEST Proton-GE.

Sorcerers Lair - a decent Zen original with surprising depth.

Wild West Rampage - cowgirl action, another Zen original.

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2328760/Pinball\_FX/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2328760/Pinball_FX/)

The downside is that all tables are downloaded as part of the one package. So, from memory, it takes up 30-something GB of storage, even if you don't own any of the DLC tables.

There's also its predecessor, Pinball FX 3 (confusing, huh?), that comes with free tables. PBFX3 has a lot more tables, but will not see any more new tables/features in the future.",SteamDeck

Not very into mobile games in general, and I wouldn‚Äôt really bother to play it on my laptop.

But it runs fantastic, and with some custom button assignments it plays much better. As well as having the trackpads available for quick UI nav, or clicking on items in game helps a lot.

*The default assignments for select, back, primary skill etc are weird because they are just mapped in order based on how the mobile controls were. It‚Äôs very awkward unless you change them around.*

I had heard a lot of negativity surrounding it, but it‚Äôs actually a decent game. If you aren‚Äôt terribly susceptible to suggestion and able to resist clicking on every internet ad you see, or rage at what‚Äôs in someone else‚Äôs grocery cart‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fairly easy to straight up ignore the existence of the Mtx/P2W in the game and just enjoy it within the bounds of freeness.

1. Open Desktop Mode

You may still be able to get better performance by tweaking the settings via the config.

According to the wiki, it should be in .local/share/SatelliteReign/

You'll have to do the same thing as above in showing hidden files in Dolphin to see if it's in that folder. Anything that starts with a . is a hidden file.

jh5ld1r,"I played through all 6 of the Pixel Remasters to completion on Steam Deck. They were great, ran perfectly, and I had no issues with text. I played in handheld mode sometimes, and also docked on my TV.

Full disclaimer, I never played the originals so I don't have a preconceived expectation of what they should've looked/played like. But what I did experience was fun and I had a great time playing them all. 

I think unless you're super hardcore with expectations compared to the originals, it will be just fine.",SteamDeck
jh5hs1f,"Eh it depends.

Pixel Remaster console QoL features may or may not be patched in officially. But they were modded in even before the console version was announced.

Technically, the GBA version has the most content. But it has bad colours (thanks to GBA weak screen) and bad sound effects/music (thanks to GBA weak sound chip). But there are patches for it to restore music, graphics and some censored content.

For some reason all Pixel Remaster games do not have extra content the games had in numerous re-releases. Kind of an asshole move on Squeenix part.",SteamDeck

Opting for the Switch versions over the PC versions is a great choice for me, because:

* Classic font (this is not a big deal, as you can mod in a great-looking classic font on PC)
* Toggle random encounters on/off - this is such a godsend, particularly for the games I've already played before. Love them but it often feels like at least 30-60 minutes of most dungeons end up being sort of tedious battling of standard monsters. You can't get too comfortable though because if you skip all random encounters the bosses will cream you, so use judiciously.
* Experience points 2x (or more, if needed) to eliminate grinding where necessary. Currently doing this with Final Fantasy IV and yeah, this game is pretty hard without grinding even just a few hours in. I don't have that kind of time anymore.
* Battle speed ""very fast"" and battle message speed ""very fast"" turns Active Time battles in Final Fantasy IV into harried, intense skirmishes, almost arcade-like. No time to waste, act quick or end up with dead party members! It's still early-goings for me but this brings a whole new hardcore feel to the game, I think.",SteamDeck

---

A small disclaimer: I'm using analogies to explain how flash memory cells work. I tried my best to be as accurate as possible while also making it possible to understand what's going on, but the technicalities will probably be lost or jumbled up in the process.

To get in the nitty gritty now: NAND memory is a really fancy and complicated way of jamming electricity (electrons) inside a cage (between two insulators) and reading it back. So, say the cage is mostly full, that's read as a `1`, while if it were empty or close to empty, that's a `0`. With higher-density NAND cells, we can take it a step further and check *how full* the cage is.

For MLC (multi-level cell), we can translate the fullness of the cage to two bits:

- Full: `11`
- Half: `10`
- Empty: `00`

For TLC (triple-level cell), we add another bit and can represent a range from `111` to `000`:

- Full: `111`
- 6/7: `110`
- 5/7: `101`
- 4/7: `100`
- 3/7: `011`
- 2/7: `010`
- 1/7: `001`
- Empty: `000`

And so forth with 2^4 levels and 2^5 levels for QLC (quad-level) and PLC (penta-level), respectively. This is great for storing more data in the same physical space, but it also means that it gets exponentially harder to distinguish between two different levels. For example, if the cage is 25% full, is that closer to half, or closer to empty? If we meant to save the cage as half full, but it saved at 24% and was read as empty, that's called *a bit error*.

But hey, computers don't make mistakes so it would never fill it to 25% when it was supposed to fill it to 50%... right? Well, not quite. Physical damage of the insulation layer throws a wrench into that nice, idealistic thought. Let me explain:

Suppose you want to empty a cage and go from full (or half, or whatever) to empty. If it were a regular cage, you could just open the door and let some electricity escape, right? Unfortunately, electricity is more like pressurized water; it naturally tries *very* hard to escape on its own. With that in mind, let's change the analogy up a bit:

The ""cage"" is actually a watertight box with a pressure valve. When we let water in, we change the pressure so the inside of the box has a lower pressure than the outside, allowing water to come in. And when we want to let the water out, we put more pressure inside the box so it pushes water out.

In flash memory cells, this is done by sending high voltage pulses to change the ""pressure"" in a way that makes the electricity ""tunnel"" through the insulator (the pressure valve). This process of filling and emptying the cell (i.e. writing to it) permanently damages the insulator, leading to that problem I described earlier.

---

So, now that you understand how flash memory works, you're probably wondering why SSDs are fine, but SD Cards aren't. The gist of it is that SSDs are far more likely to employ techniques to mitigate both how often the cells are damaged, as well as how that damage affects their functionality.

**Wear Leveling:** Suppose you have some part of the hard drive you're constantly writing to (swap file, maybe?). Those cells would be damaged more frequently compared to the other cells. SSDs mitigate this by shuffling around the physical location of logical blocks so all cells get worn down evenly. In simple terms, it keeps moving that swap file's physical location around while telling the computer that ""yep, it's still in this place you put it.""

**Error Correction:** Using the magic of software, the SSD can read back the cells that were written and check for discrepancies. If it doesn't match what was supposed to be written, the block of cells gets marked as bad, and the SSD tries to write the data to a different block instead.

**Overprovisioning:** Often, SSD manufacturers will actually add an extra 20% worth of capacity to an SSD. These blocks are only accessible to the SSD controller itself, and they're used as extra space for wear leveling and replacing bad blocks. It's basically giving up (invisible) capacity for in exchange for a longer lifespan, which is often more important anyways.

**Using lower-density cells:** For a tiny device like a MicroSD Card, you pretty much need the highest density cells available to fit that much data within a small form factor. SSDs have the luxury of space, though, which allows them to use more-durable TLC or MLC cells.

jhboij6,"> Avoid anything critical on an SD card period anywhere.

Ehhhh.

It all comes down to the manufacturer's reputability and the parts used. Cheap NVMe SSDs can still be made with low-durability PLC cells, shitty controllers, or no overprovisioning. And contrary, a decent-quality (I.e. not a ""backup"") portable SSD or SATA SSD can have a pretty good lifespan.

Always do your research. Brand reputation (are they well-established and known for quality SSDs?), pricing (is it too good to be true?), and manufacturer warranties (1 year? 5 years? 25?) are important considerations.

Also, don't buy SSDs from Wish, AliExpress, or (probably) Amazon. With the former two, you get what you pay for (or less). With Amazon, you either buy a fake, or you get shipped a fake because of SKU binning with third-party sellers.",SteamDeck

jh7noil,"It really depends on why it's unsupported.

Eg Destiny 2 - Unsupported due to anticheat. Won't work.

Lots of other unsupported games? Will work fine. Might need tweaks.

You should check out [protondb.com](https://protondb.com), search for the specific game you're looking at to see if it's one of those ""unsupported, but plays fine"" games, or one of those ""totally borked"" games.

There's a decky plugin to add this stuff to the game's page, but you can do it manually yourself just fine without needing to mess with decky",SteamDeck

All you need is an old controller enough beaten up to not care if you mess it up a little, and few bucks worth of materials.

For example, you can mix corn starch and silicone sealant to make a quick setting silicone putty.

You can use that to prototype a shape that feels comfortable, and then make a mold of it and cast it in resin.

Or if the rubbery makeshift putty feels just right, you can keep that as is.

It's really hard to find a reliable solid controller for big hands.

Either you find one shaped just right but the insides are crap, or the insides are solid and reliable but the shell is creaky and crumbles apart.

jh7p44e,"Metadeck is still a thing, but its purpose has changed direction. SteamlessTimes, which was integrated with MetaDeck, has been removed for a while now. What you're looking for now is called Playtime. SteamlessTimes has migrated into that instead. It gives a more detailed report similar to the 3DS's Activity Log (time played per day, week, etc.). You can find the Playtime plugin in the Testing Store or ""Steam Deck Homebrew"" Discord. Please be aware that it's still very beta and there will be bugs.

Things like tracking time during sleep has been fixed btw. [Link to Github](https://github.com/ma3a/SDH-PlayTime)

Edit: I believe there is a Migrate button for MetaDeck times.",SteamDeck
jh7utz0,"Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for, I have one question though, is there a way to edit the playtime to whatever time you want? I have lots of games I played on an emulator that aren't saved on Metadeck, so no migration, but they are saved on the emulators. So if I could put the time I have on the emulators for my games and continue from there that would be cool.",SteamDeck
jh7xbs4,"This is the pinned message on the Discord:

> HOW TO EDIT PLAYTIMES 
> (nonsteam playtimes will be show on steams Homescreen/Gamescreen, steam times that are edited will only be shown in detailed view in the plugin itself, because steam stores the playtime of original steam games online / I recommend only editing nonsteam times :OKAY: )
> 
> 1. Start every game you want to edit times at least once (i know it's tedious, but much easier this way imo) (you probably don't need to do that, if you migrated)
> 2. Download DB Browser for sqlite from the discover store
> 3. maybe first make a copy of storage.db in ~/homebrew/data/SDH-Playtime (if something goes wrong, you'll still have the original file)
> 4. Open the storage.db with the db browser
> 5. click browse data in the upper left
> 6. make sure every game (ID + game name) is listed in the table game_dict
> 7. Make a note of the game ID you want to edit
> 8. change table to overall_time
> 9. find your game id and edit the duration (it's in seconds / you'll maybe see a huge number with a dot and more numbers, but just seconds is enough for example 3h = 10800, no need for a dot, if you edit)
> 10. do it for every game you want to edit
> 11. click write changes in the upper middle
> 12. close db browser
> 13. restart the steam deck (yes restart, not just go to game mode)
> 14. ???
> 15. profit",SteamDeck

On my (KDE Neon) desktop, it was easier! Corsa Calzone worked immediately with no fuss. Dirt 2 was mostly ok, but the clutch was weird.

windows: yes, it's perfect. (yes, i liked this wheel so much i installed windows on my pc to use it. but... constant system crashes. full shut down)

**steam deck:** after going through the steps to get oversteer installed, **yes**, it's very good except the clutch pedal isn't recognized. everything else is great, though! i'm getting about 20-30 fps on a 1080p ultrawide on medium, about 40s-50s on low.

linux desktop: same steps (easier in fact) for oversteer, but ... the clutch pedal still doesn't work, my 1440p monitor doesn't work (unrelated to wheel), and the force feedback is a random bucking bronco trying to constantly throw me off bridges and cliffs and shit.

note: the wheel feedback in windows and on steamdeck have changed me. it's so good! I can feel the wheels before they slide out! it's amazing! the fact that my main pc can't do this hurts my soul.

jh6weg5,"For one thing, the units work differently. 

In *Wargroove*, there are two types: powerful single-entity commander units and then normal squads (groups of swordsman, pikeman, etc).

In *Symphony of War*, you maintain a roster of many individual units (I think up to 200). Each unit has stats and a class, though the class can be changed; this is like swordsman, archer, that type of thing. There are three types of units: ordinary units which can be recruited between missions at relatively low cost, unique mercenary units, and the special commander units you get going through the story.

Every unit has a leadership stat, and any unit can be appointed as a commander of a squad (important story units are automatically commanders). High leadership stat = more units in the squad. Squads can be equipped with items, some of which increase leadership. I remember spending a LOT of time swapping items between squads to maximise the total number of units I could take on the field.

Also there is no in-level recruitment of generic units in *Symphony of War*. You have to set your squads up before the mission. I think you could retreat injured squads by swapping them for another squad in your army but you couldn't recruit new squads during a mission like in *Advance Wars*, whereas you can do exactly that in *Wargroove*.",SteamDeck

you said people are going to pirate games. that's simply not true. you see people _playing_ the switch games on the deck, but it's a leap to immediately accuse those people of piracy. most people buy the games they like.

jh23rqz,"Symphony of War hooked me massively which is something Wargroove never did, the game also feels more mature and the gameplay is excellent.

jhak0h0,"You seem really invested in the ""Steam Deck is for piracy"" narrative. I'll just let you be, bud. Sorry for you.",SteamDeck
jh2b86k,"My first question would be: 
Do you have permadeath enabled? Having that on makes the game a whole lot harder. 
I‚Äôve also played Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, Wargroove and tons of SD Gundam/Super Robot War games and I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äòbase‚Äô difficulty is much higher.

One thing I‚Äôd strongly recommend is to be mindful of both terrain and weather. 
Some of the firearm squads can be overwhelming but rain will reduce their damage as will forest/mountain/swamps. 

Assassins are also very useful in this game as you can use them to ambush from the aforementioned tiles and if you give them some dodge rate % artifacts they can even be used as ‚Äòtanks‚Äô.
For some reason the AI loves going for assassins with ranged units and their hit rate is fairly low.

The ability to shuffle can also be very useful if you think that your troops won‚Äôt be able to withstand an(other) attack, I‚Äôd quite often use the terrain to my advantage blocking off the AI by holding bridges and then using shuffle to save units that would otherwise get destroyed. 
Quite often you‚Äôd also have a base/castle close to a bridge and if you place ranged units there you can attack 2 (or 3 with bowman) tiles behind the archers while your other units hold the bridge. 
This would likely also result in the AI using ranged enemies to hit your ranged troops but they‚Äôd get a good amount of extra defense from being on a castle/base tile. 

Generally I‚Äôve found myself focusing on a few things: 
- Cavalry (they‚Äôre OP), namely a combination of knights and valkyries led by Barnabas 
- Jules‚Äô ranged unit, get them to bowmen, don‚Äôt bother getting a healer for them
- Main protagonists unit, one healer, 2 sentinels, a blademaster or zweihander with a red mage and sorceress (siren)

I‚Äôd put most of my resources towards these troops and where possible I‚Äôd get them to capture objectives to increase their leader stat which allows you to add more units to that squad. 

The biggest thing though is quite honestly the arena, I recommend doing only silver arenas which gives you the best rewards on average. 
Sell the EXP and CP scrolls and buy artifacts to strengthen your troops. (Or hope you get lucky with the arena rewards) 
The arena is what makes the game a lot easier than some other games, it‚Äôs quick and easy to do and if you get lucky you can get game changing artifacts.

Also, try and buy units whenever you can (do look at their stats/skills obviously), the bazaars also offer some really good units. 

In terms of the talent tree, try and focus on the left and middle trees while also going for more HP/armor for cavalry and work toward increasing everyone‚Äôs unit capacity by 10. (You need the left and middle tree to unlock that)

Advanced tactics can also be quite useful though I didn‚Äôt really use them as much on my second play through. 

I‚Äôm half tempted to start playing the game again now, it‚Äôs just so damn good.",SteamDeck

Some of the games that got me into using the deck for gaming were Fallout 4 (a game I already liked a lot, that runs very well with little effort on the deck). Fallout 4 also works offline, unlike MANY AAA RPG games (Looking at you, RDR2).

And some indie titles also got me playing it a lot - three big indie titles I played over the last year:

1. Clone Drone in the Danger Zone - this is kind of a third-person arena robot fighting game, it's really quite a lot of fun and exciting. Multiplayer is less exciting to me.
2. Vampire Survivors - Really needs no introduction
3. Deep Rock Galactic - Co-Op mining sci-fi shooter, my favorite game of all time.

jh68wgy,"do what people like DIY\_PAPI did and cut a vertical strip off the backplates thermal pad so it doesnt obstruct the airflow of the aluminium heatsink on the deck, you can see the indentation on the left of the heatsink which the thermal pad partially blocks.

Also as you have mentioned, yes the backplate doesnt shift heat away from the deck, it acts like a sponge so it just takes longer to heat up, but once saturated your back to square one without the means to shift the heat away.

That just means slapping a fan to the backplate so you can indeed shift some heat away.  a decent option is to buy something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/StarTech-com-85x70x50mm-Socket-Heatsink-Connector-Black/dp/B00006B8EK/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3OIMZY3IAID3H&keywords=60mm%2Bfan%2Bheatsink&qid=1681076148&sprefix=60mm%2Bfan%2Bheatsink%2Caps%2C71&sr=8-5&th=1) which is a copper heatsink with screwholes for a 60mm fan, the size means unlike a 40mm fan some others use, the 60mm one will cover the whole plate on the jsaux backplate, you just need to stick a 2-3mm thermal pad between the two so you have room between the backplate and the copper/fan so you can put an epoxy glue between the two to hold them together.

That copper sink+fan combo i linked uses a 12v fan, just replace this with something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Noctua-NF-A6x25-Premium-Quiet-Version/dp/B01G20CHX4) which is doable as that copper block has screwholes for fans, there are 3-4pin fan header to usb converter cables that all seem to be 5volt only which you can power from a dock or a very small usb power bank whose only job is to power the fan.

Again the backplate isnt much use apart from the looks if you arent sticking a cooling solution to the backplate, and a bare minimum if not the above suggestion is a small fan of some kind.",SteamDeck

jh6cb86,"the important part, esp watching DIY\_PAPI's videos is regarding the heatsink, and what he did to cut part of the thermal pad so the airflow valve intended isnt blocked, he has 1-2 vids showing this, just a case of searching his vids for ""JSAUX BACKPLATE"" and watching the relevant vids, he also re-uses the cut off thermal pad portion to stick to the decks thermal pipe to allow heat from that to move into the heatshield, which then goes into the jsaux backplate.

The part where you can differ is what to do after that, basically the actual cooling portion, some use peltier coolers, tho they are power hungry and typically cool down the most in an area the deck doesnt get the most hot so the effect is lowered, the best still seems to be a chunk of copper and a bog standard fan from what ive been watching, there are better solutions, but some require more indepth work i myself am unqualified or simply scared to attempt or end up being much more expensive and might require 3d printed parts and from the case of the ""CoolDeck"" project, a custom made copper metal construct which replaces the heatshield.

I just went for the simple route, a small chunk of copper that has screwholes for a fan with an alternate 5volt replacement fan, nice and simple...   How effective will it be?  probably not amazing but better than nothing.

Also remember not to just look at temperatures when looking at stats, also look at the cpu/gpu clock speeds, remember the deck by default IF running a game that taxes it will draw all it can to get performance it needs, if you slap on a cooling solution, your deck WILL get cooler, and the deck will respond by upping the cpu/gpu clock speeds to get more of what it needs, which in turns heats things up again.

So this means if you benchmark your games, always leave a game running for quite a while and monitor the temps AND the clock speeds/frequency, rather than laser focusing on just the temps and maybe fps.",SteamDeck

jgx0ryc,"I had the same question after looking at the Steam Store page, watching the videos, etc.

I took a gamble and bought it. Hated the first 30-60 minutes of the game because I didn‚Äôt get how to play. I didn‚Äôt understand why it was so hard and why the only input was movement.

I asked a friend who has played for awhile about the game, and I read some advice on Reddit, and I finally got it.

The game is supposed to be hard and feel limiting at the beginning. Very quickly though, you can start unlocking power-ups, and each power-up makes the following game run more fun.

As you begin to unlock more power-ups by buying them with the gold you earn during runs, you also begin to unlock other things - new characters with different abilities and stats, new and mysterious items, new and gratuitously fun new weapons, and more.

And the game usually tells you what you haven‚Äôt unlocked yet and how to unlock it, allowing you to set specific goals. Like recently, I wanted to unlock something that required evolving six weapons during a single run to unlock. Evolving six weapons can‚Äôt be done in a 15-minute run (at least I can‚Äôt do it), so I knew it was going to take a 30-minute run.

I had to try out different strategies to accomplish this goal. I failed many times before I succeeded. Which stage should I play to maximize my chances of evolving the six weapons? Which six weapons should I evolve? But most importantly, which character should I choose who will stand the best chance of evolving six weapons?

It was incredibly rewarding to finally evolve the six weapons after finding out the perfect combination of stage, weapons, and character that fit my play style.

For me, the game is about pursuing the unlocks.",SteamDeck

Same thing with Satisfactory. Although with that game, I did feel like I had a fair grasp on things and quite enjoyed it. But I didn't play for a week, came back, and couldn't remember half of the bindings. I haven't touched it since. I know Satisfactory isn't on console, but fortunately the devs have said when 1.0 releases they'll have full controller support.

It's just an opportunity to do all this other stuff you were excited to get to do anyways, and then you go back and do another run (now with a different weapon 'cause it gives you a bonus because you haven't used it recently) and you know you gotta improve your relationship with Hermes some more so you decide to go for his upgrades when you can and well you haven't tried *this* combo yet so let's go for it, and so on.

Supergiant has never done a direct sequel to a game before, so Hades 2 being in development speaks to just how much they struck gold with that basic premise.  Like, really only Pyre is fundamentally different from their other games, Bastion, Transistor, and Hades are all essentially the same premise of ""isometric action RPG with direct WASD control (not Diablo mouse-only control) with story-based incentives to try out every possible weapon and combination to keep the gameplay novel throughout"" but specifically Hades's roguelite loop is what takes it from these indie darlings to something nearly everyone has to admit is genius.",SteamDeck

jh2xr8k,"\> What are the big benefits of using Lutris vs adding non steam games to library and running with proton or installing their launcher inside gaming mode?

How do you install the game in the first place?

For many people the answer to that is Lutris. Lutris is one of the ways to easily install non-native games on Linux by wrapping each installer in a script that takes care of all the little things you need to configure yourself for a game to work if you were to set up a game through WINE on your own.

If you already have a different way to install and configure a game or its launcher (e.g. Heroic, individual installer scripts, native binaries, or you're simply handy with WINE), I don't think Lutris provides much additional utility if you don't intend to use it as a launcher (which you won't on Deck, obviously). I don't exactly have a ton of experience with it, but FWIW I've found in the past that Heroic and Lutris have different degrees of success installing different games, and I've also had success (on a Linux laptop, not Steam Deck) installing some games through Lutris that I failed to install myself with a standalone installer script wrapper.",SteamDeck

Im not familiar with the issues regarding digital item sales, but my impression has been that it's not bad. There's other things they could do to make it better like a UI that lets you sell multiple items easier. 

I could be convinced otherwise on the digital item sales, but what OP is talking about is totally different. As far as I understand, OP bought a physical item from Steam and returned it. Valve has essentially denied the return; they only transformed the purchase from one type to another instead of doing a refund.

This encourages OP to buy the deck again and then sell it on ebay or something, instead of it being handled by Valve. This makes shady sales on ebay seem more legitimate and/or devaluing OPs money. 

Denying uses of the Steam wallet in particular ways for digital transactions, on the other hand is done to protect the digital marketplace from bots and such.

If you bypass this, the air will come directly to the fan and out of the top. 
Some components rely on airflow despite the thermal pad mods. There's a GN video about this topic. They also noted that lower APU temps aren't always good with the factory fan curve, since the lower rpm fan mode also limits the airflow over the mobo.",SteamDeck

jgxk01q,"I actually had this issue for a month or two. The Steam Deck could connect to the internet, but the connection to the Steam Servers would continue to drop. I tried everything I could think of including the wifi setting in the developer options. No amount of tweaks to the Wifi networks would help, and it occurred over usbc/ethernet as well. It started shortly after my brother moved back in but I never made the connection. I finally dug around in my router and figured it out. 

Turns out, my brother manually set static IPs on his personal devices (phone, pc, etc). There's nothing wrong with this on the face of it. However, the IPs weren't designated on the Router so the router didn't know that they were taken and assigned his phone's ip to me Steam Deck. This meant they were both fighting for traffic and the Deck kept dropping connection.

To fix it, I just went in and manually assigned an Ip to my Deck in the Routers DHCP reservations to something different and reset everything. This way, he can keep his phone setup and my Deck would get a different IP every time. Haven't had any problems since then.

This issue may also arise from sleep mode too. Before the Deck goes to sleep, it's assigned one IP. When asleep it's not connecting anymore. Depending on how long it's asleep, the router could end up giving that IP to another device in the meantime. When you wake up the Deck, it's still trying to communicate with the same IP as before and now there's a routing conflict. Just a theory.

The best thing to do is to go ahead and set a manual ip in your router for the Deck. I already had most of my other devices (NAS, PC, Server, etc)manually assigned, but just didn't think about the Deck as an important network device until then.",SteamDeck

jha8hs0,"Thanks for posting this issue, I was struggling with this for over a week before spending a day to fix it. Sad to see the issue is quite widespread. 

I tried a bunch of things to fix it: 
>- Disabling/uninstalling TunnelDeck plugin for deckyloader (it was allowing me to use OpenVPN)
>- Unchecking ""Enable Wifi Power Management"" under developer options.
>- Disabling IPv6 under network manager settings for this wifi connection.
>- Logging into my router's settings and setting the 5Ghz frequency to use channel 36. That last point seemed to stop the issue of booting up the deck and it refusing to accept the saved wifi password.
>- Ensuring the 5Ghz wifi frequency bandwidth is set to: 20/40/80Mhz rather than 20/40/80/160. 160Mhz can put 5Ghz wifi into the DFS range where military/plane/radio signals are needed. That can cause your 5Ghz wifi to be disabled or changed channels temporarily if those frequencies are detected. That was also the motivation for moving down to channel 36 too.
>- If your home network has multiple access points, make sure the main router /modem isn't fighting the other access points. At my mum's place she had separate access points both sending out 5Ghz wifi under the same SSID name. Normally that could be fine but in this case, each access point had their DHCP server enabled and both were serving a different IP range. I believe my deck would connect to what it thought was the same access point but be offered a different IP from what it expected, leading to the connection being rejected. Disabling the duplicate DHCP server should resolve the issue. Though in her case I just removed the extra access point as it was no longer needed with the equipment installed by her new ISP.",SteamDeck

To avoid this issue, you could establish a static IP on your router that is dedicated to your Deck and set your Deck to that IP. If it loses its connection, it won't dynamically (The D in DHCP) reassign the IP to another device and the Deck can try to re-establish its connection.

If you want a network device to always have the same IP address even if your DNS is broken; assign it a DHCP reservation in your DHCP server. The only devices you should ever give a static IP address to are devices required to be working for your DHCP server to work.

The Steam Deck will try to suspend (temp turn off) the wifi chip when you sleep the device. When it wakes back up, it may still have old data/certificates and may not be updating them properly, but this is an educated guess on my part and hasn't been confirmed.

My solution is at the end of the evening when I put my Deck away for the night, I select ""shutdown"" from the power menu.

So, on some routers you can use more channels for a single wifi ssid that increases speed by using more bandwidth. Once I eliminated that thing from my house altogether, the steamdeck started working great and I haven‚Äôt had a single issue since.

jgxtn8b,"It sounds like maybe the Steam Deck may be trying to ‚Äúkeep‚Äù the same IP after the router thinks it‚Äôs connection has dropped and re-assigned it to another device

This would make sense with the fact it seems it can sometimes be fixed by disabling WiFi power saving - my guess is that the Deck is not sending WiFi keep alive packets often enough to maintain the connection with the router (the router figures its offline) but the deck doesn‚Äôt realise that it needs to request a new IP.

This was only an issue for me because another device was manually set on the device end without my (the network admin) knowledge. I also have a pihole on my local network running as the primary DNS server, which my brother was also bypassing by setting up the ip and DNS settings on his devices. This may also have contributed to the issue, and using a DHCP reservation in my router for my Deck was a nice middle ground for our specific usecase.",SteamDeck

Right, and the thing to do in such cases is to give it a manual IP _outside_ the DHCP range.",SteamDeck
jgxlyik,"Agreed. This is more of a networking issue than Wifi. Unfortunately, most people also still use the wireless gateway provided by their ISP, which usually locks down a lot of the more advanced networking options. Beyond getting a personal router, they won't even be able to reserve IPs through the router even if they knew how.

My best guess is that this is somehow related to the way they suspend the sessions on the Deck, but everyone is too focused on the ""Wifi"" portion and not the overall network.",SteamDeck
jgy4umr,"There may be an IP conflict then. If you have the Eeros, you should be able to go into the **Reservations & Port Forwarding** settings and reserve an IP for your Deck.

It just forced an IP renewal. Binding an IP to the MAC address is better than turning off an entire address protocol. IPv4 has 65536 private IP's. IPv6 has 2\^64 total addresses. There are plenty of IP's to bind on a private home network. Forcing a release/renewal is better than turning an entire address protocol. Disabling an address protocol is a bad fix. Don't assume DHCP is always going to work.",SteamDeck
jh6h6kc,"Yes, and routers with IPv6 also assign IPv6 addresses to devices along with IPv4 addresses. A look at the client table will demonstrate that. If knocking out IPv6 ""fixed"" it, that's because it forced the Deck to request a new IP, which would fall back to IPv4 due to IPv6 being disabled.

If I'm wrong, then explain to me how disabling IPv6 solves the problem.",SteamDeck
jh4zbxv,"IIRC you can only set up a static IP address on the device if you aren't using DHCP, which pretty much everyone is using nowadays.",SteamDeck
jh410va,"You're making a false assumption. Disabling IPv6 would only work if the Deck was already assigned to an IPv6 address. By doing so, it forces DHCP to provision another IP to the device and renews the network connection. It will fail again in due time when the Deck fails to keep the connection alive and DHCP releases the IP. All you did was force a release/renew cycle and reestablish the network connection in a very roundabout way.",SteamDeck

If you're saying that the deck, upon wakeup, holds its last IP until the system realizes that it needs to release it and get another - well yeah that's how it's suppose to work. 

If the problem is that it takes too long, and you want the deck to always have the correct address, assign it a DHCP reservation in your DHCP server, don't manually configure its IP address on the device at all.",SteamDeck
jgxi3ct,"Yeah, even if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs technically the router‚Äôs fault, literally every other device I own does not have this problem, so there must be a way for Valve to fix it.",SteamDeck

jh0huyc,"Perhaps on yours. At the moment everytime I‚Äôve seen this error I get two notifications. One that says unable to connect to steam servers and one below it saying unable to connect to the internet. While I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre possibly agnostic of one another, a majority of the time this is because of a network issue caused by the deck going to sleep and losing its assigned IP. 

My example was a super watered down version but as a network admin, it definitely has to do with the assigned IP which almost always meant no internet connection on top of being unable to connect to a specific verification server (whether steam, windows, etc). Thank God were not having to modify host files anymore!!",SteamDeck

jh7ukxn,"I've setup hundreds of devices and dhcp has never failed for me, as part of my degree I had to learn how to assign ip addresses manually but luckily I've never had to use it. In this specific case I agree that assigning a static ip will fix the issue but it's not the reason it's failing. Ipv6 is still not supported by a lot of things and is relatively new. I believe turning off ipv6 and forcing it to use ipv4 should fix the issue especially since wifi connectivity via steam os should not have a bunch of edge cases that would cause dhcp to fail, especially since it's developed by a billion dollar company.",SteamDeck
jh53uz6,"Yes, that is correct. You can choose between DHCP and a static ip address on your devices. And that is all you have to do, no need to change DHCP settings on your router. If you still prefer DHCP, but want the device to always get the same address, you can configure that on your router.

Wouldn't be that sure about DHCP in general. I mean yes, the everyday consumer doesn't bother with it but for instance I like to have a static ip address for some of my devices, especially things like NAS. In fact, it's sometimes even needed. :)",SteamDeck

jh5vsd0,"So, you're saying that the Deck doesn't try to use the last known IP when it wakes up? It's sounds very much like that is what is happening. People are saying disable IPv6, which is bad advice. The simplest short-term solution is to just toggle WiFi. That will force a release/renew of the IP. That doesn't provide a long-term solution however. You *can* reserve an IP to a specific MAC address (IP Binding) so that only that the router will only issue that IP to the MAC you designate.",SteamDeck

Anytime I get it I still have internet working just fine on the Deck, though Steam connectivity seems to work too...it just doesn't think it's working for whatever reason.

Mine didn't have anything to do with the assigned IP, though - I have IPv6 disabled on most of my internal network (long story revolving around not using AT&T's gateway but having fiber...the best way to keep it stable for long periods of time is not using IPv6), including the network the Deck is connected to. It doesn't even try to get an IPv6 address and I have an IPv4 address set in the DHCP server that never changes.

If you‚Äôre in an environment you can somewhat control for outside interference, a decent access point in an unsaturated area can push 600m on 802.11n/2.4ghz@40MHz. The average consumer in the US has a whopping 198m/23m circuit so for the most part consumers are not going to see the 2.4ghz band as ‚Äúslower‚Äù, the opposite is more likely due to how often home networks are deployed with 1 AP for the entire house.",SteamDeck

4. Choose \`select the default wineprefix\`
5. Choose \`Run explorer\`

Deck Number 1: Rattling Fan on low RPM, right stick made a crunchy sound when moving, trackpad haptics uneven (left side barely had any haptics), L1 button was really wobbly (it felt like it's about to fall off) and needed more force to press down.

Deck Number 2: Rattling Fan on low RPM, Volume buttons were really wobbly and sometimes didn‚Äôt register a click, the L2 Button scratched against the shell which made it feel like shit.

While anyone calling it a walking simulator isn‚Äôt really wrong, it still feels like a super reductive hot take since the game has so much going for it as far as story, stealth, and combat. It‚Äôs also nice to play something that not only tries to be different but succeeds at it.",SteamDeck
jgzsqp9,"There's a Humble Monthly thing where you pay ¬£12 (just cancel straight after if you want and keep the games) and get a bunch of games, one of which is Death Stranding this month

I'm about 4 hours into it, also a big MGS fan. The setting is intriguing full marks there, though the story so far as dragged a little, especially dialogue. Nothing ruinous it's just a little pretentious but I'm interested to see how the story plays out and gets paid off.

As for the gameplay, so far I like it. I was really in the mood for some game focused on traversal where the goal is to just to get to a point on the map and this is scratching that itch. Planning out your journey around the terrain and which equipment to take with you is fun. Aside from moments of action/stealth its a mostly chill experience which I'm enjoying but can understand may not be everyone's cup of tea.

I think it's really depend on what mindset you have going in, what you're expecting, what kind of mood you're in. It's defiitely not a walking simulator though, there are genuine gameplay considerations based around the traversal.

I used to have a game buying problem where I would spend hours and hours scrolling and obsessing over the $10 a month I had as a budget for games. Since I've started it I just stop scrolling now because why would I buy a game when I could be getting it in the next months bundle.

jh3n2r4,If you‚Äôve had your SD for 8 months to 1 year it‚Äôs not a bad idea. Thermal paste dries and hardens. If you‚Äôre already in there it‚Äôs not the worst decision.,SteamDeck
jh3nsms,"Lol it takes a helluva lot more than a year for the paste to dry out. It‚Äôs probably not worth it, look at the YouTube before and after videos. The difference is maybe 2 degrees, which is probably within the hysteresis curve of the cooling fan‚Äôs control logic.",SteamDeck
jh3vfhb,Hmm...what about the thermal pad thing? Does that have any benefit?,SteamDeck
jh3vwtg,"The phase changing ""pad"" from Honeywell is a great replacement. PTM7950 is what you want.

It's supposed to last a long time too, so shouldn't need to replace it for years.",SteamDeck
jh3w7yz,Yeah that's the one I bought. Is there a significant improvement on the temps tho?,SteamDeck
jh3zbb9,"Some people have reported better temps, but honestly my deck never had overheating issues and always ran good temps. The difference is that now it takes less fan speed to keep acceptable temperatures and is therefore quieter. I would imagine if I had tested with the fan at a constant speed I would notice reduced temperatures, but I didn't bother with that. The PTM7950 is just better at moving heat away from the APU, so it doesn't need to run the fan as high now.",SteamDeck
jh3xacs,"Great name BTW, according to posts on here and some Youtube videos on thermal paste change‚Äôs, using the Honeywell pad nets a 5-10¬∞C temperature difference especially in heavier games.

jh28l7p,I use heroic for all non steam games and then add them to stream through heroic. 2 things 1. turn on fysnc or games will run like ass 2. people will tell you non steam games don't support shaders but the reality is you just can't download precompiled shaders they will still generate shaders though. heroic and lutris have their own shader folders used for when you run them directly from the desktop and all non steam games (even emulators which is useful for something like PS3 Emulation which is always trying to compile shaders otherwise) will put their shaders into the same folder as actual steam games shaders,SteamDeck
jh2699s,"All three options you mentioned have their own advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Here's a brief overview of each option:

1. Hero Launcher: Hero Launcher is a relatively new tool specifically designed to make it easier to play games from the Epic Games Store and other stores on Linux systems. It has a user-friendly interface and supports automatic installation of games and updates. However, it's worth noting that Hero Launcher is still in beta, so you may encounter bugs or compatibility issues.

2. Lutris: Lutris is a popular open-source gaming platform that supports a wide range of games, including those from Epic and Origin. It provides a unified interface for managing your game library and can automatically configure wine or other compatibility layers to run games. Lutris has been around for a while and is generally stable, but it does require some manual configuration for some games.

3. Direct installation of Epic and Origin: This option involves installing the Epic Games Store and/or Origin clients directly on your system and running games through them. While this method can work well for some games, it can be more difficult to set up and may require some additional tweaking to get everything working smoothly.

Overall, I would recommend trying out Hero Launcher or Lutris first, as they provide a more streamlined experience and are generally easier to set up. If you run into issues with either of those, you can always try the direct installation method as a backup.",SteamDeck
jh39r9b,"I just tried for the last 2 hours to get lutris to work and while it did install Epic and i was able to install games, Lutris itself was not able to detect those games. I also could not login to my Epic account through Lutris because of some bug that's been present for over a year it seems. This basically made Lutris unusable.

I installed the Heroic launcher and within 5 minutes I was playing the game through handheld mode.",SteamDeck
jh2mz7e,"I have a bunch of games on epic, and for me, cloud transfer was really useful, so I first tried hero. The results were title dependent and for most not good at all. Instead, I just partitioned ssd and installed win and now I use ms games/epic on that partition. But you can try hero and check if you prefer it.

Also, be mindful that if you want to install win, don't do it on microsd as it will not work well, go with an external ssd or internal one.",SteamDeck
jh44h66,"Heroic for GOG and Epic (most games). 

Skip Lutris, and install the EA app directly, Origin is being phased out.",SteamDeck

jh4gmgd,"Yeah, it's what u/esotericine said about the SteamOS filesystem being set as read-only. You can change that, but SteamOS updates will overwrite whatever you do so it's not worth the hassle right now.

And while you could chroot a lot of things for XAMPP, you need to create users for apache and MySQL and get access to the network layer to respond to the port requests.",SteamDeck
jh4zkp9,"The process would be  
1. set up a password.  `passwd`  
1. ""unlock"" the file system  `sudo steamos-readonly disable`
1.use pacman (arch linux app stor) to install xampp  `sudo pacman -Suy xampp`
  
So 3 terminal commands. And you are going to need the terminal for setting up xmpp so better get used to it",SteamDeck
jh4hcu7,"imo this is definitely well out of end-user territory.

there's a lot of things the deck is good at, but while it can be treated as a general purpose OS, things get progressively more hassle-shaped the further you get from ""playing steam games"" and this is a fair bit removed from that ideal.

we should ask a different question: is xampp actually required, or just what was asked for because it's a known example of a web server? could vserver or some other flathub hosted package suffice?",SteamDeck

Make sure you know what you‚Äôre doing and be careful about running random commands / scripts you find on the internet - you may get your Steam Deck into a bad state or compromise your data.

jh1sftw,"Any game that runs on smooth 60fps can be optimized to last 3-4hours.
For example doom 2016/eternal. Set settings to low, in quick settings select 40hz, limit TDP until you see that it starts to drop below 40fps inside a building (outside it will be more demanding), check what gpu clock is set right now(overlay level 4) and save it.
For me 40hz, medium, 8watt 1300Mhz results in 14-16w power consumption which is around or slightly below 3 hr of play time. The same will work in Nier Automata. For Control you need to disable reflection completely. Can go even farther by changing render resolution to 960x540 (need to select 720p as display resolution, otherwise it will only allow you to set 400p or 800p render resolution) which will net you 4 hours of playtime.

Heroes of might and magic 3 can last 6-9 hours. Do not limit fps to 30,it will decrease cpu and gpu power consumption to under 1watt, but the game will be in the slow motion. Better limit TDP to 3w and set gpu clock at 400Mhz, without restricting the fps. It will make the gpu and cpu run under 1w (APU will still use about 3w,since there are other components in it).

There will be dips when the game loads planet chunks as you move around and, if you target 25, it will take a while for the game to allow you to land. I would start with 1500 MHz or so. I usually do this on the fly. I might also limit Max GPU clocks but I usually don't. You can even combine the fsr2 from the game with fsr1 from OS and have crazy low rendering resolution.

Depends on the games, but all the ones you mentioned together should fit on one 512GB micro SD card. Maybe even 256GB, I don't have Witcher 3 installed to check size, that's the one I'd expect to be biggest.

\> But I‚Äôm worried there‚Äôs gonna be some bugs, I‚Äôll be without Internet for months on end,

The games you mentioned should not require an internet connection after first setup. You can put Steam into offline mode and turn off the Deck's Wifi. AFAIK offline mode should work indefinitely: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/xt3xec/steam\_offline\_mode\_has\_no\_time\_limit\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/xt3xec/steam_offline_mode_has_no_time_limit_an/). However, I'm not sure you'll find many people here who have tried offline mode for literal months and can share their experiences.

If you ever bork your system and need to reinstall, you can prepare a recovery drive to re-install the system: [https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3). If you keep your games on micro SD or otherwise back them up to external media, you should not need to have network to re-install them (this is just my common sense speaking, since there are people who swap SD cards - I have not personally tried this). However, I do think in a re-image scenario you would still need at least temporary internet access to log into Steam after re-install. \[There are utility programs (Linux, not Steam Deck specific) that should be able to create a backup image of the entire system (which should include Steam authentication tokens and such) and restore from it in case of issues\]([https://askubuntu.com/questions/19901/how-to-make-a-disk-image-and-restore-from-it-later](https://askubuntu.com/questions/19901/how-to-make-a-disk-image-and-restore-from-it-later)).

  On that same note, do you happen to know capacity of the deck? I have a couple 20k power banks but those charged my switch maybe twice from 50 to 100, I imagine the steam deck has a larger battery? 
 Do you recommend wireless kb/m or wired?",SteamDeck
jhdxzom,"ah that makes more sense now. SD requires much higher power output, so something 45W+ and ~20k mAh will be your best bet without being backpack sized. Anker's PowerCore+ is great but expensive af. it will charge everything though.

SD will last longer depending on the type of game you're playing too, and how hot it gets. if i play graphically intensive games, it will drain in less than 2hrs sometimes. if i play most emulator games it will last like 6hrs. just something to keep in mind with battery/charges.",SteamDeck

Mostly because when you use ConsolePort on steam deck, you control the mouse cursor with the right track pad. If you just play with an Xbox controller or something, it probably isn't an issue.

jh61k3x,"It's really not bad to get it running. I installed [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) in desktop mode, and then added it as a non-steam game. I run the game in Game Mode, not desktop. There are a ton of great guides for doing this part on youtube. Then I installed Curseforge in desktop mode, which has a Linux version. You will definitely need the addons ConsolePort and Immersion.

Once in game, setup and tweaking settings probably took 30 minutes or less, and the game runs flawlessly. It's a lot of fun playing a hunter, other classes may be more difficult the more skills you need to use, but you can easily set up 25 skills with the left and right triggers as modifiers (default). 

If you decide to go for it, let me know if you have any issues and I'm happy to help.

By the way, for Classic Era I figured out that it uses an older API that doesn't have input overlap, which is why I'm having the issue with the mouse cursor not being visible. The game can't take inputs from a gamepad and a mouse simultaneously, whereas WotLK and Retail can. There's basically no fix from what I'm hearing in the ConsolePort discord, which is a bummer. But the game is still playable, just a little annoying to not be able to click things with the trackpad mouse while moving.

Oh, for targeting, I highly recommend mapping ""Tab"" to one of the back buttons. It makes targeting enemies really easy. You do this in the Steam controller settings.",SteamDeck
jh4063k,">I guess I think it's both a Steam Deck and ConsolePort issue. Mostly because when you use ConsolePort on steam deck, you control the mouse cursor with the right track pad.
