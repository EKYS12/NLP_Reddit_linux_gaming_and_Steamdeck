jibfcl5,"Fun fact: The Steam Deck logo is just a pokeball that isn’t trying. 

Second fun fact: Everyone else here is wrong. I’m right. 

Third fun fact: Human blood works as an industrial lubricant.",SteamDeck
jib4baj,"No it's not. The ""logo"" you see on the memory maker is coming from the old camera knob. They where used to crank the camera for to record. The clip could be pulled up, then turned and put back in.

Edit

The logo of steam comes from a vintage  ""steam machine"" and the steam deck is a flywheel part that's also used in steam machines.

Interesting highlights from the article:

\- started slow, but by 3 PM, the trial space got a lot more visitors and you had to wait a little to get in there

\- One of the store clerks from Edion told me that this is a **test market**. They are not sure yet if the Steam Deck will be sold nationally in Edion, and for now they want to see how the sales are picking up before making a decision.

\- All test units were 512 gb models. When you asked to compare the screens, they had to show a youtube video cause there were no other test units.

\- 15 to 20 titles could be tested, mostly Japanese games.

\- Komodo employee said sales were “amazing” and buyers were: ""mostly PC gamers but they are starting to see also more and more people who were not PC gamers in the first place picking it up""

\- A TV crew was going around to cover the event

\- Store said they have 'several hundreds' of units in the store.

\- Not many cards left after the first day, so almost all the stock was sold (to buy one, you pick up a card and hand it to the store clerk)

\- 512 gb model is the most popular

\- Price is the same as online

\- Writers has concerns about whether there is enough explanations of what Steam is (there are posters and pamphlets, but not a lot of people to give explanations). Although apparently he could ask questions to a Komodo employee before? Some games also had issues with crashing or launching offline. Room for improvement, but overall impression was positive.

\- Video of the event is coming tomorrow",SteamDeck

ji9nynp,"The time for Steam Deck's cutting edge has passed.  


As a console-like hardware platform, it's time to establish the Steam Deck as a stable platform for gaming.  


It already has the Steam Store as a platform-agnostic repository/storefront.  The SteamOS base where there's no risk of some other company pulling the rug from under you.  


And the most important of all.  A hardware generation commitment Valve has where they don't make a customer base's devices obsolete by releasing a much faster model way too soon.  


I think ASUS Ally is great.  But it has two possibilities.  ASUS can just fire or reduce the whole handheld gaming team to just a handful of people.  Or their release can be so successful that one year later, there will be an Ally 2.  


Remember that nobody talks about the Aya Neo 1 anymore.    


Whatever happens folks, the Steam Deck's back catalogue is massive and growing despite not being able to play the newer super demanding games.  The SD's a game portal.  It's not a standalone toy that needs proprietary cartridges you'd beg devs to make releases on.",SteamDeck

Sure, there are kids each year who just got old enough to ask for a Switch, but I don't think many kids are getting a Steam Deck, and if you didn't get a Switch after the release of any of its major games in the past 5 years or during the pandemic, what are you waiting for? There's the new Zelda game (maybe 5 people got it on the Wii U and just now have a reason to upgrade to the Switch), but I don't think seeing Sonic Frontiers being on the Steam Deck is going to cause you to change your mind and get that instead.  

Nintendo games dominate sales in Japan. I think showing this as an alternative to the Switch is a losing battle there. This should instead be portrayed as it's own thing: you can't play Elden Ring, Final Fantasy VII Remake, God of War, etc. on the Switch, but you can on the Steam Deck.",SteamDeck

Elden Ring sold well in Japan on PlayStation and isn't on the Switch, same with Final Fantasy VII Remake. I'm sure there are people who would like to play console games on the go, which the Steam Deck allows.

Back then (10+ years ago) they only ever bothered porting games to PC as cash grabs, like they were throwing us sloppy seconds. Don't even get me started on the abysmal KBM support (or the straight up lack-thereof for some games)

It's changed a lot in recent years, but we do still get shoddy ports and badly performing PC releases from Japanese game developers. FromSoft games on PC are still mostly terrible experiences. Hell, we had to literally sign a petition before Bandai even bothered porting the first DS over to PC back in like 2012.

The environment has changed a lot since then but most Japanese developed games are still very much console centric.

ji7vtx2,"They haven't,  but it was pretty easy to decipher if you followed along until it was available without needing a pre-order, which was less than 6 months ago.  I doubt things have changed that recently, but I could have expected there to be a difference between week one pre-orders and month 6 pre-orders.",SteamDeck
ji9oz6t,"Perhaps so. I haven't shopped for parts in about a year or so, but last time I looked at GPU's, they were going for up to ¥400,000 ($3,000)",SteamDeck
ji8y1l0,"There are almost no american companies either. It all comes from taiwan (asus, msi, gigByte etc).",SteamDeck
ji9m83i,"I was just outside Yellowstone when sign-ups opened. Crappy mobile internet made me miss the first round.

Still worth it considering I use it more than a book when I have to sit and wait anyplace.",SteamDeck

ji9w1ds,lol im making it weird ok get blocked now,SteamDeck
jia42ng,"Just delete your account, super cringe",SteamDeck
jiblybp,"Jesus Christ man, why are you like this?",SteamDeck
jib9qzi,"I just recently finished Stray, Great game imo

Might have been nice if it was a little bit longer, but I would rather they cut it short than stretch it out too far and ruin it. 

I was very satisfied with the ending",SteamDeck
jiba441,"Nice, Stray is awesome, it was the first game I beat on my Deck.

I beat Eco Quest The Search For Cetus back when I was a kid, and just learned there was a sequel I never played. Looks like the sequel didn’t get the  CD-Rom talkie upgrade that the first one got though.",SteamDeck
jibu3el,I played through Stray three times getting every achievement. All on the Deck.,SteamDeck
jic38ib,"I think Stray is unironically good. Simplistic and short, yes, but it provides a good and notable experience. I named the cat Gordon Freecat, really felt like a HL2 cat-based spin off and I loved it.

I've not got a problem with compact, short, games so long as they fulfill their promise in that shorter timeframe. Not every game has to stretch to six+ hours - Portal takes about three hours and is considered one of the greatest games ever made!",SteamDeck
jic6cuc,It was the first game I got for the deck but it's the first one I beat. I really liked the story and cried at the end. I was honestly okay with the length because I played it in short bursts but it ran very well on the deck without changing any settings.,SteamDeck
jic0uuu,Cool!,SteamDeck
jic971i,"> It’s not manipulative like so many games I have to keep her away from

What does that mean?",SteamDeck
jibah29,Now I’m wondering if the old Sierra games will work on the Steam deck. Going to try that out this week,SteamDeck
jibz4yr,"Dude I used to love that game. I might load it back up now that you’ve reminded me, can’t remember if I ever actually beat it",SteamDeck
jicb67k,Word. Portal deserves all the praise,SteamDeck
jicbrqe,That’ll be the next game I buy her,SteamDeck
jicb30c,Online games that convince her to beg me to spend money on in-game transactions. It’s INTENSE for a young kid who doesn’t understand they’re being manipulated.,SteamDeck
jibc6o6,"Yeah, get ScummVM, it’s on Discover, it’s basically an emulator for old Sierra and LucasArts point and click adventures, and it’s awesome.

I’ve got every old point and click adventure on my Deck.",SteamDeck
jibf6db,"Yeah Scummvm is the way to go.

Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis was one of the first ones I put on the Deck too.",SteamDeck
jibhysh,Maybe I’ll finally beat Gabriel knight,SteamDeck
jibjen4,"Highly recommend beating Gabriel Knight, it’s a great, great game.

The sequel is great too if you can tolerate the FMV acting of the era.",SteamDeck
jiaufny,Some massive QOL improvements that make it a hell of a lot easier and more streamlined,SteamDeck
jibuyge,"I just set this up for the first time, super easy as an emu newb",SteamDeck
jibkrgy,It's unfortuate that this particular version of EmuDeck takes as many steps backwards as forwards due to some bugs.,SteamDeck
jic1zep,"I still don't like how it forces you to download the steam rom manager every time you use the quick/custom installation, github download speeds can get awful (sub 100kb/s) sometimes so watching it slowly download something I will never use is painful. I know that you can manually download the emulators on your own but that feature doesn't show download progress and is looking bugged, I couldn't download pcsx2 on its own so I had to go over the custom installation again to get it.",SteamDeck
jic0gfj,Do you just run the version you have of emu deck on the OS desktop or do you need to download a new pack?,SteamDeck
jic8jo3,"Does it support bios files in subfolders yet? 
 
Don't know why such a tool insists on placing all bios files in the same folder. 
 
Found out you can override some emulators settings and been putting them in Sub-Folders (PS2, PS3, etc), but this should be the default.",SteamDeck
jibc13m,Yeah it's been posted in this sub about a dozen times already,SteamDeck
jibkwh3,I’m sure they will get patched up. I’m always patient and understanding considering it’s a zero dollar piece of software done out of love for retrogaming,SteamDeck
jibn7wj,"What bugs are you referring to? I have had no issues thus far. I only wish they had defaulted to the native Linux version of CEMU, but switching to it was easy enough.",SteamDeck
jic8uom,"I've seen a few reports of various problems that I cannot find off the top of my head. The one I'm experiencing is being unable to disable some of the filters, and I've seen others say they are unable to turn them on. Mainly a lot of smaller things that should be easy fixes.",SteamDeck
ji98zu8,"This is why preorder bonuses are anti-consumer. It's psychological manipulation to prey on your FOMO over almost nothing. They released a broken shitty mess that you don't want to play, and you're considering letting them keep money they didn't earn over some insignificant costumes. These items are not worth the $30 you can save by waiting 6 months to a year for them to fix this terrible mess.",SteamDeck
ji9a0jq,"If you can't play the game, why keep it?",SteamDeck
ji8z35u,"Best to refund it. I don’t think the preorder bonus justifies it’s premium price and poor performance. I definitely want to play and finish this game, but it doesn’t feel worth it at the moment.",SteamDeck
ji90cmp,"On steam deck? My RTX4090 has issues with this game (studdering, crashes, slowdown, etc)",SteamDeck
ji8yx7s,The more people buy broken shit like this the more it doesn’t matter that they make broken shit,SteamDeck
ji8xma2,"Yes Man. They deserve massive refounds. Ull be able to buy later at a lower prive and better performance. Dont worry about skins, modding is much better",SteamDeck
ji91id4,DO IT,SteamDeck
ji9ejlq,Refund it and wait for the summer sale. By then hopefully everything will be ironed out and you’ll get a good discount.,SteamDeck
ji9j0qv,"I dont even understand why People really buying some preorder/gold/ultra-editions etc. Just for some stupid Skins and reward devs for shity cosmetic Content instead of real Content like big Level, game-modes etc.",SteamDeck

Wow",SteamDeck
ji8y8l3,They’ll undoubtedly be made available and on discount when the main game is eventually. Such is the style these days,SteamDeck
ji985ve,"Yes, refund. Once they fix it, you can buy it on sale. Getting tired of companies releasing games first and patching later. Already learned my lesson long ago never buy a game day one.",SteamDeck
jiadq5l,Fuck the skins. Don't support this practice of releasing games in terrible states.,SteamDeck
ji8zdfk,Yeah that’s the sad truth is that they only listen to our wallets. I’ll help to make whatever little difference I can by refunding the game. Thanks for everyone’s input! Developers (especially ones as big as EA) shouldn’t put out shit ports on launch days. It’s ridiculous especially for the asking price.,SteamDeck
ji97s5r,"I refunded. I actually just didn't like the game, but it ran well on my PC. Didn't try on steam deck",SteamDeck
ji9hsu1,"I got Fallen order 3 months after initial release and just about every other game because when ever I end up playing it ""Hey it's new to me!""",SteamDeck

ji960t2,wait for a sale,SteamDeck
jiacj2s,"Yes, gotta send a message. Just buy it again when it's fixed",SteamDeck
jiafs57,Fuck the preorder bonus. Don’t let that make you keep a game you aren’t happy with.,SteamDeck
ji9mfgt,"Yes, buy it when it’s cheaper and has been patched multiple times.",SteamDeck
jiac8mz,"Refund it, consumers need to send a message, game companies are so shitty these days and we should all be tired of paying premium prices for broken unplayable messes. Buy it when it's fixed, if it gets fixed....",SteamDeck
jiadinh,There’s really no guarantee it will ever work on deck,SteamDeck
jiah2s8,In a year you won’t care about the preorder skins.,SteamDeck
jiam04m,I suggest everyone refund it. Don’t allow them to do this.,SteamDeck
ji98c4e,I got Jedi fallen order for like 5$,SteamDeck
ji9esqt,"Yes and while you're waiting, buy Jedi Outcast, that one's fun as hell",SteamDeck
jiajkk1,"Since being burned by the hype and release of Cyberpunk 2077, I’ve stopped buying AAA releases on launch. We all need to stop buying games on release until they’ve been verified to weed this shit out.",SteamDeck
jiako0h,"I saw the pricetag and immediately decided I'd be pirating this one. 
Fuck 'em.",SteamDeck
jiamcge,Refund. No preorder bonus is worth that.,SteamDeck
jiao9ef,Yes. You bought an EA Game at release Price. You betrayed every real Gamer in this world.,SteamDeck
jiauice,"I don't know.  If you are dissatisfied then yes, probably.

(the ""bonuses"" are there to trap you)",SteamDeck
jiavx5q,refund and grind some VAMPIRE survivor.,SteamDeck
ji931hf,"I was going to say it shouldn't even be a question until I read the pre order bonus part, I don't think pre order bonuses are worth it but that's how I value these stuff, you might value things differently",SteamDeck
ji985wx,"I probably would on the steam deck. While it mostly plays decent on the series X, it's definitely struggles with the framerate in some places.",SteamDeck
ji9noqk,"Why not? If it never works you saved money, when it does work you can buy it on sale and you've saved money. If you keep your money in Jedi Survivor then you've basically told EA, yes this is fine, you can have my money for this mess so long as you might, maybe, possibly fix it later, which they will cash in on and decide ""it's not worth it to fix this later, we're keeping your money"" eventually.",SteamDeck
jiabs53,"Yeah wait later. Although I've been doing research it works great on traditional pure Red systems. Steam Deck is just a portable boy, I would never expect a 2023 AAA title run fluidly on it.

If you have an Nvidia GPU try not using the Game Ready driver as I think there I a shader cache problem.",SteamDeck
jiabt9m,"Nevermind the pre order bonus. Get a refund and give them money when/if the game works if you still want it then. 

You've paid premium price for a sub-par experience. When in a few months the price will drop and the game might actually work.",SteamDeck
jiad6bf,"Yes and buy it again in the next 3 weeks with a steed discount and ""fix"" gameplay",SteamDeck
jiadlx7,Pre-order bonuses are irrelevant.,SteamDeck
jiafeic,What good are the skins if you can't play the game?,SteamDeck
jiafp30,Who cares about skins in single-player game and who says you will not find a better looking one in-game?,SteamDeck
jiakb8f,Do you actually need Obi-Wan themed cosmetics? I really wouldn't recommend running poorly optimized current gen AAA games on the Deck.,SteamDeck
jiamnbn,"My guy this is never going to work on steam deck, the first one struggles to maintain a stable 40fps so you'd be extremely lucky to get the new run to run at 30. I don't understand why people don't understand that the Deck isn't made for playing brand new AAA games",SteamDeck
jiaugxu,Funny tons of people here saying to refund yet when I made a post about refunding my deck people acted like I was a criminal and bunch of people were claiming steam employees wouldn’t get bonuses due to refunds? Lol this sub is strange man,SteamDeck
jiavyg1,"You're what's wrong with the industry.
Just don't pre order.",SteamDeck
jiaxbup,"Seems like you already know what you want. Don’t know why the whole steam deck community has to weigh in on your Star Wars jedi video game preferences.

jiaxnrh,Yes.,SteamDeck
jiayc2h,Always have trash refunded.,SteamDeck
jiazktw,Do you really have to ask strangers on the internet to tell you what to do?,SteamDeck
jib0ua2,"yes, refund, and dont buy until they fix that mess, everyone should be doing this",SteamDeck
jib16yh,Get the damn refund. This behavior is why they get away with it every time.,SteamDeck
jib18b7,"I would refund it. What good are bonuses on a non functional game. Keeping a broken game sends a message to companies that it is fine to keep making bad unoptimized ports and selling them as if it's fine to do so. EA lied to you. You should recoup your losses and wait for improved stability and potentially a cheaper price. 

That's was the logical answer. The less logical and more catty answer is yes, refund it, the preorder bonus skins are f**k ugly! You would likely never use them unless you're trying to look intentionally unfashionable. Since the game is litered with cosmetic unlocks I doubt you would ever miss their loss unless your FOMO goblin brain will always nag at you... Which if it is really that bad of a thing for you, then I guess just just keep it. For me it would be a sort of badge of shame.",SteamDeck
jib1bkq,"Get your refund, play something more deserving of your time, and circle back in a few months when the issues are fixed and the game is on sale.",SteamDeck
jib6b0n,Yes,SteamDeck
jib76up,No but you should definitely post on Reddit for easy karma… oh wait,SteamDeck
jibdvtp,"Refund, wait, buy again when on sale.",SteamDeck
jibgfhg,"you haven't even played it yet? bro, are you incapable of independent thought? steam gives you 2 hours of playtime to request a refund, just fire the game up yourself and make your own opinion instead of asking a bunch of nerds what they think.",SteamDeck
jibj3z0,"If you pirate it when it's fixed, you'll get both a working game and the preorder bonus!",SteamDeck
jibyyca,"I like to usually wait a year when big things like this come out. Yeah it's exciting to be one of the first, but if I'm gonna spend the money on it I want it to work ""right out of the box"" That year period gives companies and people plenty of time to fix a tinker with things so when I get it, it all works out. Get the refund. Buy a bunch of smaller games or save the money in steam wallet till Survivor is on sale.",SteamDeck
jic2h7b,"Yes. You can repurchase it later when the problems are addressed and it may even be cheaper. 

I’m very skeptical about preordering games but I’ll never do it again after the last BF.",SteamDeck
ji9qoxc,I have been able to smash through the game. About 25 hours in and it’s a fucking great game. I’ve been fortunate enough to have zero problems on my pc and it performs smooth 60fps on my older gpu and cpu . I did try it on steam deck but it was rough. The alternative is to stream it to my steam deck. The game is REALLY good if you can get it working. It sucks for a lot of people. Hopefully it gets fixed soon and everyone can finally enjoy it,SteamDeck
ji9mzec,I’m glad I bought it on my Series X. I had a feeling it wouldn’t run to well on my deck. I haven’t had any issues yet.,SteamDeck
ji9s6de,"Preorder ""bonuses"" is another part of why these games keep launching in this state.",SteamDeck
ji98522,Refund it. Ea doesn't deserve your money.,SteamDeck
jiatejj,"I don't think paying the $70 for a seemingly rushed game that is completely unpromised for cosmetics is the best idea, but you do you.

I also got it for the steam deck. I booted it up, saw some issues, checked the reviews, realized that it's not worth the money, then promptly returned it. I'll wait for a sale after bugs are fixed.",SteamDeck
jib21t0,Yea refund it,SteamDeck
ji9bzq8,"They made the exact same mistake with the last game, unbelievable, unacceptable. We need to stop paying $60 for beta versions of games, these companies are never going to get it unless gamers start being conscious consumers.",SteamDeck
ji98kb3,"I kind of suspect that a forthcoming DLC on Steam will eventually come out, & it will include all your preorder whatnots. May have to wait a year or so, but if you’re like me, you’ve still got a back library a mile long…",SteamDeck
ji9bzu9,Pls refund it. The pre order skins or costumes are worth nothing. They are just cosmetic items. These type of games should not even exist and the only way of doing it is ppl should stop pre ordering and not buy day one.,SteamDeck
ji9l1dc,"Unless you find yourself pining for the early days of 3D gaming with frame rates around 15-20fps, I'd say you should refund it.",SteamDeck
ji9qec5,It wasn't verified for Steam Deck. Not their fault you took the leap blindly.,SteamDeck
jia5kyx,"Refund and stop preordering, also the deck is not a AAA machine",SteamDeck
ji9if0w,"Nah keep it cause after a month or 2 it will be fixed, the original game was like that too in the beginning. kinda just par for the course with games this big. It looks like a great game too so just wait a bit.",SteamDeck
ji97wua,It’s…..its not gonna work on deck my man,SteamDeck
ji9c01c,"Classic case of preorder regret...I'd say just stick with it at this point, though IDK why you thought it would run good on Steam Deck anyway",SteamDeck
jia5put,It will never run on this generation of the Deck. At best next. Probably 3rd,SteamDeck
jiatvqk,"Steam Deck or not, the current state of this game is really bad (on PC). Bad enough to ask for a refund and not say to publishers that it's OK to release a game in such a state.

It's not only disrespectul to gamers, it's a middle finger to everyone, consumers, shareholders, etc. saying ""as long as we release **something**, it's good enough"". 

PC gamers are not third-class citizens.",SteamDeck
jiavtpf,I think refunding sends a stronger message than not purchasing at all.,SteamDeck
jib313p,Yes! Wait until they patch it. I read they’re aware and working on the issues but it’ll take time. I have a higher end PC and shocked about the lack of optimization for more main stream components. I can imagine the deck needs some work as well. Great game btw but you can wait,SteamDeck
ji99hhv,Play it on console if you have one... Series X and PS5 run it perfectly fine....,SteamDeck
ji99ioi,I just have EA Play Pro. Auto upgrade to premium editions for $99 a year. I never buy EA games anymore because of it.,SteamDeck
ji9u9vm,"I’ve met a ton of people on r/gaming claiming it’s not that bad, it runs fine on their rig and it will be fixed soon. 

They seem very reasonable and trustworthy, I say keep it! 🤪",SteamDeck
jiayqit,"refund it. there is no reason to keep all of this if the product is broken. let that be a lesson: don't pre-order ""AAA"" games no matter the pre-order bonus. It does wonders to me and it will for you as well. now i mainly buy indie games because of how broken those so called ""big budget"" games are at release.",SteamDeck
ji92pmz,"I’ll play devils advocate here; no. It *will* be operational in about three to five months. You won’t be able to play it right now at launch unless you play it on another platform, but it will work. Personally, I’m patient. However, you bought preorder bonuses. Keep them. They’re yours, so is the game. Just wait to play it.",SteamDeck
jia7n5n,"Do you only have a Steam Deck? Refund right away.

While I wouldn't say that improvements in performance are impossible, I consinder it highly unlikely that the game will one day run with a stable 30.

I haven't even tried it on my deck but I have seen YT videos of it. 20-22 FPS in the first area where my 4070ti had no significant problems. For me the stuttering fest began 40 minutes in.

However, it must also be said that the performance problems are 100% due to a bad port.

Modern CPUs and GPUs are not used or addressed properly at all. That's why even a 4090 has problems with a stable 60 FPS despite way more than sufficient performance. Respawn has to improve on this front, which could also significantly increase the performance on the Steam deck.

While I am sure though that the patches will help with my I5 13600KF and my RTX 4070ti, it is not possible to estimate that for the Steam Deck.",SteamDeck
jiahg4w,Your first mistake was buying JS on steam so yes refund the game,SteamDeck
jiaig4b,I refunded and got it on Xbox instead. Wouldn't run on my PC despite being above recommended specs. It will get better on PC but it's really not optimised for it right now,SteamDeck

jia1b7x,What is even attracting people to trash like this in the first place? That price point for 20 hours of gameplay even when it works is atrocious. Fuck ea,SteamDeck
jib93ps,"I won't refund. Runs decently on my PC in most areas, yah stutters badly others. Otherwise besides the shitty performance the gameplay/story is GOTY. Fix it and Respawn will win GOTY. I am a huge fan of star wars and the series. But you fools be the fools you are ;)

And I'll keep pre ordering games! You can blame me for a price increase idc.

Even low preset and FSR performance I can't break 40 FPS. I'm worried that I can't play on my deck based on those results. I'm loving the story so far though.

ji9tsi0,"The big companies are spoilt by the sales immediately after release, in spite of the shitty performance of their games. If you want to convey certain message to those companies, do not buy unless the performance is up to your expectations. That normally happens after a few patches. Never prepurchase. I can never understand people who prepurchase.

So go refund it, if you do not wish to see more premature releases such as this in the future.",SteamDeck
ji9ty3k,Just wait for one of your friends whos library sharing to buy it then you can check if it finally works on deck then buy it,SteamDeck

ji9wdom,I refunded 2k and bought it again on sale later.  The game had less glitches and lame animations by the time I got on. Was glad I waited,SteamDeck
ji9wqsx,Refunded it on my pc. Tried it on console. And overall it’s not terrible but I just can’t get into it. Really upsetting. I was so excited.,SteamDeck

I'm playing on 11700K + 3080ti, at 1440p max/ultra settings RT ON, and it varies wildly from 80fps to 30-40fps with insane amounts of stutters. It's playable thanks chiefly to g-sync, and the game itself is gorgeous, from design to combat to gameplay to story to everything. But boy oh boy, the performance is one big shit...",SteamDeck
ji9y4i5,"I always look at games pre order bonuses and its always some avarage skins and sometimes like free coins or smting but I never pre order because many games go on sale sooner or later so might aswell save the 50€ and if the game is amazing and I end up playing it for the rest of my life, then I do microtransactions for basically the same things. Id only pre order a MULTIPLAYER game like Csgo2 if it gave like rare tradeable skin or sum cuz then it would have value other than p2w boost or cosmetical.

In conclusion, dont pre order unless the bonuses can be traded or sold later as rare items.",SteamDeck

jia3fik,Yes. Don't buy games that are broken just because the developers promise to eventually fix it. It should be in a working condition at launch. Patches should be for optimization tweaks and polish only.,SteamDeck

Recently I bought re village with the extras because despite the pointless skin it also came with actual playable dlc that I would've bought later anyways. IMO you shouldn't have preordered to begin with, but more so you shouldn't keep the preorder because you didn't even get a functioning game. Refund. Buy on sale when it's actually playable. Live with the exact same gameplay experience you original wanted and just tolerate not having a subtly different cosmetic enhancement.",SteamDeck

jiag261,"I know others have said this already, but please forget about those cosmetics.  It's people like you who are fueling these companies into doing all this pre-order and microtransaction crap.

Years ago I decided to not give a fuck about cosmetics in video games and it seriously has been amazing.  

Not only do I save unknown amounts of money from all the games that offer cosmetic microtransactions, but the best part is I never have FOMO!

I never have to worry about if I want to pre-order or not, I never have to worry about doing a certain quest/event/achievement within a certain time frame.  I never have to worry about missing out on holidays or getting into a game late.

The only thing I lose out on, are different colored pixels.

PS - If you feel like you simply **need** those cosmetics, cracked versions of games almost always come with every pre-order/deluxe upgrade available.  Not that I support piracy, we need to make sure those execs can afford their next yacht!",SteamDeck

jian281,i could reply with the answer you deserve but i am quite confident i will get banned if i say so.,SteamDeck
jianals,"Personally, I would refund. A few skins - which will most likely be sold once the numbers drop off - aren't worth holding on to a game that doesn't run. Heck, you might find something else to get in the meantime or a few things in the Summer Sale.

You can always buy it again if they fix all its numerous issues in the next few weeks.",SteamDeck
jiankmf,Yes,SteamDeck
jianvd0,"Yes, absolutely. This won't change unless their feel the affect on their bottom line.",SteamDeck
jianwu6,"Vote with you wallet, never pre-order again. Pre-order bonuses are FOMO manipulation.",SteamDeck
jianyrg,"Its up to you man. I didn't buy it but at the same time I think it will be fixed over time.

I bought cyberpunk and it friggen sucked at launch, I got a refund and to get people back I think it was as low as 10-20 dollars for their big fix patch and that was like a year later and it plays great now.

So like I said, up to you. The original one actually is very good on PC so that gives me hope.",SteamDeck
jiap8qu,"Cyberpunk was awful on release even on top end gaming systems.  It runs fine on SD now.  I’m sure Jedi will eventually run fine also.

jiapk3a,You can likely buy the preorder DLC code later on the 3rd party markets that I can’t mention without getting the AI lecture.,SteamDeck
jiaqkda,Obviously refund it. JFC people care way too much about insignificant cosmetics. Send a message to these corporate fucks by yanking the money out of their pockets.,SteamDeck

I doubt it will be playable in the coming months or at all on the SD",SteamDeck

jiarwhe,The bonuses aren't worth the extra non-sale money and the risk that they won't actually get it working properly. Get your money back and get a game that has some respect for the players.,SteamDeck
jias5c5,Yes. You shouldn't even have preordered it in the first place. That's how we get half finished garbage again and again.,SteamDeck
jias9qf,They gave everyone the pre-order bonus after like 3 months for Fallen Order.,SteamDeck
jiaswcb,"I mean, if you don't have a desktop PC just refund it.

I would say it's playable on PC, it is bad. But playable.",SteamDeck

jiax4x1,You should have never preordered. Every new AAA game is the same story now. No sympathy whatsoever.,SteamDeck

jiaycvj,"Pre order bonuses are BS if that is the reason you don't want to return a game, then you should probably return it. 

Pre orders are rarely worth it and with the state of Survivor right now I'm gonna wait. The story and game play should be why you buy and play something",SteamDeck
jiayxxo,On the Deck it is utterly unplayable from what I have seen. If that matches your experience you should absolutely get a refund.,SteamDeck
jib1ga5,"Optimization for the game was done by 2 toddlers, come back later when they promise a game ig, this new era of fixing it later is why I dont pre order anymore and lose respect for scummy companies",SteamDeck

jib7n1p,Skins? Skins?! We're talking about skins?!,SteamDeck
jib7ydo,"The game totally playable for me, hope to see these fixes so more people can enjoy the game.",SteamDeck
jib896b,Yes. Pre-orders are a way for video game conglomerates to start getting all your money.,SteamDeck
jib8my5,I definitely would.  EA selling broken crap for $80 again and just saying throw it out there for a high price and we’ll fix it later.,SteamDeck
jib8o2s,The first game barely runs on steam deck so yeah I would definitely refund.,SteamDeck
jib9aak,You preordered? Oh so you're the one I can blame for why this keeps happening,SteamDeck
jib9b3e,Yes,SteamDeck
jib9u7w,I couldn't get into fallen order. You're probably better off waiting for it to get on sale and bug free. EA is pretty much notorious for half assing it.,SteamDeck
jibaqc6,"Refund it then go buy it on ps5 and remote play it on your deck with chiaki. This is what I’m doing with all AAA titles. I beat the entirety of hogwarts legacy via remote play. 

I’m just using my deck for early ps4 titles and older. I keep hoping will get more ps3 games like red dead redemption.",SteamDeck

jibc44e,"I’ve got a beefy PC and a Steam Deck. Opted out of playing it on either and got it for the Series X. So far it’s great! From what I’ve seen on PC, I’d get a refund ASAP. It’s definable worth rebuying once it’s patched up on PC, especially if/when it gets discounted.",SteamDeck

Refunded",SteamDeck

How they got this game launched without anyone discussing performance is crazy.

EA clearly went out of their way to ensure it wouldn’t get out.",SteamDeck
jibnqwt,"I think generally speaking games now days take a really long time to he optimised period. Not just our PC's or steam decks.

Everything is a mess in general with news games.

Hogwarts was somewhat the same
Calisto protocol the same 
Cyberpunk was horrendus at the start

They slowly get patched and utlimately better after a year or something

jibr498,Any single player games I would always recommend waitin for a couple months or so for a nice sale my man 🤙 Patience and you can usually get like 50 percent plus off :),SteamDeck
jibrasi,I would if you're looking to play it on Deck. From what I hear performance is brutal or even the most robust machines. I picked up the last Jedi (Fallen Order I think it is called) for like $7 and can't wait to play it.,SteamDeck
jibree3,Yes,SteamDeck
jibrt1k,Sure.,SteamDeck
jibtyzm,"Are the premium bonuses worth more to you then a good gameplay experience? If yes, don’t refund it, if not, refund it.",SteamDeck
jibu833,Just refund it,SteamDeck
jibuiu7,"Refund it. It’s way better to pick it up on sale with somewhat of a discount on Steam in time. I bought RE4 & Pre-Ordered TLOU on the formers release date, and I’ve still not gotten out the Quarantine Zone. I barely maintain 60fps on a 3080 / 9900k. Still getting 5-10fps dips, so I think I learned my lesson on pre-ordering and will just choose to wait finally.

p.s. Deck’s performance in TLOU is still laughable on v1.0.4.",SteamDeck
jibvfeg,The pre-order bonus will be added just like the first game,SteamDeck
jibvnt6,"Tbh I was also considering it when it runs on Corusant at 40-50 not to mentions there are places and cutscenes when it dips to 15-20. (playing on pc)

jibvuo5,If the deck is your only PC platform and you have better uses for that money then definitely refund. Don't worry about the pre order bonuses. Most game companies eventually toss pre order bonuses up as optional DLC sooner or later.,SteamDeck
jibw2h7,I would hold on if you ONLY have a steam deck. It runs pretty terrible but it’s on their end. The game can definitely run when optimized and you have to trust respawn. EA pushes companies to make deadlines but respawn backs their games. Also the game is great. I have a pc as well and decided to just stick to that and it’s worth keeping imo,SteamDeck
jibwaq9,Yes,SteamDeck

jicaprg,Yup,SteamDeck
jia643f,"Well put. Not only do you save $30 by refunding/not preordering, but it’s also great (even necessary imo) not to financially contribute to companies that do this. If people stopped paying for unfinished games and waited until they were fixed, most games would probably be optimized by the time they come out.",SteamDeck
jiavqr1,"Yep, I'm not buying it for a good 6 months.",SteamDeck
jiayp24,There is literally no reason to pre order a game in this day and age. Unless of course it's an independent dev that needs to quit his job at whenever and make a killer title. EA don't need your money upfront. And they need to prove a game is worth it to me now.,SteamDeck

Videogames are bad for people with addictive personalities but that's not the games fault, nor is being weird about pointless costumes


I got the Ocarina of Time/Master Quest for $5 (that went towards a game I was already getting). Sounds pretty pro consumer to me",SteamDeck

jib8t42,"And it's a PC game, the mod costumes will be better than the preorder bonus ones anyway",SteamDeck
jibnpf7,"I guess. The shit becomes available right after release maybe with somewhat of a delay for just cosmetic crap 99.9% of the time anyways. Like can you even think of an example of a game locking actual content behind a preorder in the last 5-6 years? A lot collector types enjoy buying products that come with a bit of exclusivity too so it's really just not a problem at all for purely cosmetic things. In fact the sole reason why some people buy these things. If anything its pretty unfair and ""anti-consumer"" to those people who spent money thinking they were actually buying an exclusive product. It's just your opinion/perspective, man.",SteamDeck
jiby0mi,"Plus a lot of games re-release it a year later as the ""definitive edition"" or ""complete edition"" or whatever, which includes the preorder content, the DLC, and all the balances/fixes that they had to do post-launch.

jiak8ka,Well most gold/ultra editions usually come with season pass which are usually real content. Also people can spend their money however they want. If you love a game series I see no issue in preordering for extra cosmetics. I love the last of us and I’ll be preordering the multiplayer game/ part 3 no questions asked. If I have to wait a month for it to be fixed so be it.,SteamDeck
jiaj3uh,"I preordered it so I could get my star wars fix asap.


I ended up playing it in my PC because it looked like psp force unleashed with 100x stuttering and lag on the deck.

ji98nrj,I DO have a back library so I’m willing to wait for the sales LOL,SteamDeck
jia2lnl,"EA has figured people will by anything and don't bother to optimize their code. Just buy a 4090, just put it on my PS5 if my gaming rig doesn't handle it. Good grief people here sometimes sound a bit to comfy. I never had the time to worry until I paid off my house. I guess maybe I should have taken regular vacations, bought nicer cars had more fun but at least I can have some fun. I looked here to see if this game was worth my time. Hell no. Waste money on EA who shit on their customers just to get some skins sounds a bit weak.",SteamDeck
jia22xl,Defending EA for A bloated buggy release? Balderdash!,SteamDeck
ji9kyc4,And then in a month or two when they release a big patch and some fixes there will be some sort of sale.,SteamDeck

jib5t2o,"This doesn't just go for games but everything in life. Only reason we are moving towards a world that is extremely anticonsumer is because people cannot resist paying for stupid shit. Real life car subscriptions (Mercedes, BMW etc), disgusting GPU prices, subscriptions for absolutely everything... It's not looking good for us consumers.",SteamDeck
jibkyes,"It all went to shit when everything went digital.
Back in the day, when games came on cassette, diskettes, cd’s n dvd’s, they worked. 
Because they couldn’t push out thousands upon thousands of faulty games.
Now they push out games too early, with what would seemingly be little to none QC and testing.
Patch after patch, and in reality, the game wasn’t ready for full release for another year, years in some cases (DayZ springs to mind).
They should regulate the gaming industry better, to protect the consumer. 
2hr refund window is worthless if that 2 hrs is spent on a downloading update screen or waiting in a queue to play",SteamDeck
jib31gl,"Finally, the gaming community at large is finally getting the message we pirates have been putting out for years.

EDIT: yes, I support good devs though legit purchases. I only pirate Microsoft,nintendo, bathesda, Ubisoft, epic games and others of that lot. I support small, indie games. Now get off my dick about it. 

To summarize the words of the wise Gabe N himself, if pirates are getting a better experience than legitimate customers, you fucked up.",SteamDeck
jic7sa9,I personally enjoy buying beta games. No one is forcing to buy these pre-orders/betas/gaming passes. I was ready to pre-order Ark 2 cause it was gonna come w a remade Isle w separate DLC (should all come w it but meh) but I think they changed it now. Before digital games were not always 100% reliable. I've had some games that were absolute shit and games w game breaking bugs.,SteamDeck

jiaeq4v,Last of Us seems a lot better now. Played about 80% with only one crash,SteamDeck

jiagxnd,"PS5 is also really bad. Quality mode is ok, from what I'm hearing but it's locked to 30fps.

Performance mode is broken imo. Frequent drops to 40fps and resolution drops all the time. When it drops really low, it gets incredibly blurry as well.",SteamDeck

But there’s no reason at all to preorder anything, from anyone",SteamDeck
jiadv42,"Similar for me as well as EA / Origin won't let me login and I lost several games. Oh, and I hate their loot box / Fifa card practices.

Basically, my old email client was closed in 2015 and I lost my password. I have contacted EA / Origin several times with CD product keys and payment methods but they refuse to reset my email and password. I'm not buying anymore EA games as they're useless.",SteamDeck

ji994sc,"Sony actually do let you refund games if you notify them that you have been having issues with a game and you want to refund it and they will, had this happen when miles morales came out on the ps4, I was desperate to play it and couldn't get a ps5 so got it at launch digitally but when I played it it was filled with sub 30fps scenes so I hopped on a live chat with playstation support and they gave me a full refund to my card despite the fact I had 6 or 7 hours of playtime.",SteamDeck

ji9hkcc,"its like people never learn, crazy, we've been saying dont pre-order for over a decade now",SteamDeck
ji9b53s,Is there some reason why you bought it before knowing how it performed? I always await reviews before buying anything of the sort,SteamDeck
ji9n6ds,That’s stupid and pretty scummy imo. How are you supposed to know of you need to refund if you don’t play the game a bit?,SteamDeck
ji93nvp,Shit so day 1 ps5 patch hasn’t fixed much for ps5? I preordered but if it’s still a buggy as reviewers were saying I may refund,SteamDeck
ji9t9h6,"Such bullshit...the steam refund option should be universal, under 2 hours play time and you get a full refund",SteamDeck
ji984c4,Why didn’t you buy the physical copy on the PS5?,SteamDeck

jia4gj8,Yeah would love some tips on how your getting it to run,SteamDeck
jiarpka,"I think the game is worth the awaiting another patch... Game devs nowadays in comparison to the earlier years don't deliver anymore to early adopters. It's extremely unfortunate and we vote with our own money when we pay for these games. So in that aspect, the OP is correct but possibly getting a refund, but we all obviously enjoy playing these games so it's a pain in the arse dilemma. Respawn knows there are issues, if they don't address them in the first week, I think it's realistic to begin refunds... Just my opinion... I can't stand laziness nowadays... You received a complete game back in the day, now they half-ass everything and release the rest of the game as DLC...",SteamDeck
jic2r8p,"Of course they make money from the subscription. What I am saying is instead of buying two games - full priced at $119.98, pay the $99 a year and have access to the full EA library.

For every one person that returns the game, ten more buy it for their grandson. Just like everything else, wait to buy it.",SteamDeck

jibdt7e,"While that's part if it, I think the most important reason is the breakdown of anti trust laws with the rise of neoliberalism in the 80s, which allowed huge companies to merge, and emerging tech companies to rise unregulated. This creates a small oligarchy of powerful players, who buy out everyone else, and the state becomes even weaker to regulate in the face of powerful monied lobbying.

jic4l05,"Yeah I understand your point, but giving them a guaranteed $100 is basically the same as pre ordering. I'd rather wait to see if there's a game I want before pre-paying.

jiaai6x,No!! That really sucks.,SteamDeck
jibh10r,"Completely true, though I think it would have happened either way (it would have just taken longer). Most of the issues around this type of FOMO-creation are social, in nature, and wouldn't have been rejected or suspended through regulation anyway. It **is** insane how unregulated the industry has, and others have, become, but it's not just M&A that have contributed to the social creation.

If we really cared about the health of the industry there should be realistic limits placed (regulations) on how preorders work compared to what the final product is. Something like ""If a consumer preorders a product they're given **X** amount of time to return that product, should it not meet up to the expectations that the producers set for it in the public eye."" The problem is so much of the pre-release marketing is just outright lies or mistruth that when consumers get the final product and it's nothing like they were told it would be (or, sometimes, doesn't even work)...they're left a bit in the wind, or up to the policies of the store they purchased it from.",SteamDeck

jia1s8q,Steam lets you play like 15 minutes or something to see if it works. You can get a refund.,SteamDeck
jiads1y,"Steam allows you to refund a game, no questions asked, as long as you have under 2 hours gametime and have owned it for less than 2 weeks. If the game is unplayable or has serious performance issues, they'll almost always make an exception to those rules as well. I've got slow ass internet, and I often want to play a game on launch, so I have to preorder in order to preload the game. If the game is shit or doesn't run well, I can always refund.

Refunding likely hurts the company more and sends a bigger message than not buying the game at all. I also like being able to see firsthand how a game performs for me rather than just taking the word of others online. For example, everyone was bitching about performance issues with Cyberpunk when it launched, yet I didn't have any issues and minimal bugs.",SteamDeck
ji9902i,"That’s probably exactly what I’ll do, didn’t get around to ragnarok yet either. My thing is just if I’m not gonna play it immediately I’ll prob end up waiting for a little deal somewhere in the next 6 months to pick it back up",SteamDeck
jia7zrf,Or your could've just waited too buy it if you were planning on it being a buggy mess? The only person that loses in this scenario is you.,SteamDeck
jicao92,"Yeah, I play BF2042 and FIFA as well as the Star Wars titles like Fallen Order and now Jedi Survivor. So for me it’s worth it with how much I play those titles plus revisiting Mass Effect Trilogy on the Steam Deck has made it worthwhile.

jibphw2,You could just do without. If it isn’t worthy of your pay as you say then it shouldn’t be worthy of your time either. Otherwise you are just playing mental gymnastics to justify pirating.,SteamDeck
jia42nt,"It is underutilizing GPUs & CPUs and it's shader cache building seems to not work at all as seen by by players still getting shader compilation studders on their 1st playthrough thru the game.

The latter could actually work better on the Steam Deck after Valve adds some precompiled shaders for the game to steam for the steam deck.

I would have obviously enjoyed playing it this weekend if it was in top-top shape, especially since I loved the first game so much, but that didn’t happen.

then the origin storefront happened, and... well. the last decade and change happened. and here i am, the closest i've come to giving them money in that timeframe was for fallen order, and i only didn't because i happened to notice in time that while they *took money* through the steam store, they were not actually selling the product *for* the steam store. which i still find absolutely mindblowing that valve is okay with.",SteamDeck

While I love SteamOS and I admire how quick Valve is to patch things up when things break, I still can't help but feel like it'll always be an uphill battle they'll never win. Publishers simply don't care about whether their games play nice (or at all) on the Steam Deck, because we don't put enough of a dent into their profits to even pop up on their radar. So it's always going to be this never-ending cycle of Ubisoft and EA games breaking over and over as we're stuck waiting for the next Proton experimental update to regain access to purchased games.

At least to me that's where the ROG Ally comes in and becomes more appealing. The higher specs is just icing on the cake. Howeverrrrrr.... Windows 11 in handheld form sounds like an awful experience. I noticed in multiple press units they had Microsoft Office preinstalled on the damn thing... why?? Bearing in mind we're talking about a device which doesn't have any touchpads. So right off the bat you know you're going to be spending a lot of time removing tons of useless software from it. And you just know future system updates will forcefully reinstall them back on again. Fun.

Asus could've pulled a smarter move here and pitched the device as a ""Series P"" (P for Portable, see what I did there?) device or something. They could've had a licensing deal with Microsoft to run some ""Lite"" version of Windows, like the Xbox OS or something.

It looks like they are very serious about streaming, and seeing devices like the Steam Deck and that weird little PS Vita looking thing and now, of course, the Ally starting to generate interest, it'd really be in their interest for people to associate those gadgets with easy game streaming, particularly through Game Pass

Building things into Windows is anticompetitive, sure, but it works to help MS sort of take over various spaces. They already more or less own the controller space; even controllers they don't make tend to use their button labels and layouts, and other companies have started leaning on their design ideas (look at the Switch pro controller, for example). If they make it so Windows can Just Work on a handheld device and the center their Game Pass streaming in the OS, that puts them in a really strong position

And especially for a lot of Game Pass stuff, the work of porting the game is essentially already done - a lot of players will just be streaming a console version that already has full controller support

This is such an important thing that id argue it’s what makes 60% of the steam deck. It’s the only reason it wasn’t dead on arrival, they’re not the first folks to make a gaming handheld, but valve is the first to make it work and the biggest part of that imo is the software.",SteamDeck
ji95xcv,The Steam Deck is a *PC*. Ffs it has a desktop mode! Ugh,SteamDeck
ji9j44i,"My opinions on the Steam Deck and Valve are

1. Valve launched the Steam Deck calling it a ""PC"" and claimed that it would have much quicker iterations than conventional consoles.
2. As the device garners more success, Valve seems to be second-guessing that initial vision, because of the potential benefits from developers target-optimising for a fixed hardware specification.

There are ways around this, which is to extend support of SteamOS3.0 to third party device manufacturers, but it is obviously not ready at the moment, otherwise official OS support would have been advertised with the ROG Ally.

Valve either needs to up their third-party software support game, or massively build up and improve their supply chain and distribution channels. The Steam Deck is suffering from the lack of availability across most parts of Asia beyond Japan and South Korea, and that is a major issue.

By the time Steam Deck makes it way into the regions where it was previously unavailable, we might already be on the next generation of AMD System on Chip architecture featuring Zen 5 and RDNA3+, with devices sporting much faster memory (hence, improved gaming performance). It risks the original Steam Deck becoming obsolete in those markets.

As we can see from the rumored or announced prices that the recent devices can reach ($699 for Asus 512GB, $799 for Chinese portables), the Steam Deck is starting to look less competitive from both the pricing and performance-efficiency standpoint.

**The biggest question is, if Asus can do a worldwide launch for a next generation SoC device at $699 (a mere $50 above the 512GB steam Deck) without income from video games sales, why can't Valve?** Again, that likely points to Valve's weakness in conventional supply-distribution chain which limits their device availability and manufacturing-distribution cost.

Valve might need to speed up, or risk a similar scenario with their virtual reality ambitions (which has largely been eaten up by later competitors).",SteamDeck

You can't ramp up the power **that much** without severely suffering in the battery life department, which previews have backed-up (with some AAA games getting **under an hour** of battery life, which is insane).

The issue was going to be, and always will be, that ASUS is building their Armoury Crate nonsense on top of a bloated operating system that is just not built for this type of experience. I understand that Microsoft is *interested* in refactoring a bit of Windows to make it more accessible in this way, but at the moment it's just nowhere near ready for it. In order for a device like this to work for the general population it basically has to be a **Switch-like** experience, but for PC video games. The Steam Deck doesn't even hit that, but at least it's pretty damn close - normal consumers want to unbox it, log in to whatever the thing is, buy and play games. They **need** that process to be as simple as possible, and they don't want to screw with settings to make it work. If the games and ecosystem aren't aware of the hardware and aren't able to modify themselves to match what the user's playing on, the consumers will suffer...and non-Redditors won't think ""How can I make this work right?"", they'll just return it and tell their friends it was stupid.

The reason the Deck's screen is 1280x800 is because it has to be able to natively do 1024x768, because of a lot of legacy games.

And, another big advantage of Steam OS is the First Party Support and Customization Options. Even IF you Flashed Steam OS onto another Handheld, you unfortunately won't be getting the most out of the experience. But it would be better then windows.

I also agree that a bit more power would greatly benefit the steamdeck, and the biggest crux for me would have to be the battery life, I would like 50% more at the LEAST and Double if I could get it.  


Finally, the final nail in the coffin will be third party support for accessories and as well as repairability... the Deck has that going for it, and ASUS is gonna be ASUS, then I doubt you will get the same degree of freedom and openness on their platform",SteamDeck
jibygoh,"I think for those that view the ROG Ally as ""competition"" to the SteamDeck, need to rethink their perspective on the PC gaming space. The ROG Ally is not in direct competition with Valve. They are a partnership, an ""ally"" if you will to PC gaming as a whole. They, being ASUS as well as other PC manufacturers, help bring in new customers every day to the PC gaming platform. Which company benefits most from that growth? Which company built an empire on the grounds of bringing PC gamers together into one space where all their needs can be met with a singular app? Valve is not just in the hardware business, they are not just in the console business, they are not just a PC manufacturer, they are not just PC games developer, they are not solely a PC operating software company. Valve is and has been many things but at the heart of everything they do, they are a PC gaming services company. They provide a service, always have been and always will be. Every single PC gamer benefits from the services provided by Valve. 

You would be hard pressed to find anyone that games on PC who doesn't have a Steam account. Valve has become so synonymous with PC gaming, they are not tied to a singular OS platform. They span multiple platforms, of all kinds, to reach gamers in all their forms across whatever device they choose to game on. MAC, PC, Linux... it doesn't matter. That, my friends.... is the reason why we should all welcome the ROG Ally and others into the PC gaming handheld space. No matter what device you choose to game on... you're gong to want to be serviced by Valve. You're going to want Steam, and you're going to spend money on their store front. It's an inevitability. As long as Valve remains focused on the heart of what they are as a company... which is a PC gaming services company... they will always be synonymous with every PC gamer... regardless of hardware, regardless of operating system, regardless of location. 

Thank you ASUS for jumping into the PC gaming handheld space. Thank you for taking a chance on this market and for backing up what Valve and others already believed. This is a space for growth.

Having arguments about which device is better is almost like arguing over different android phones compared to Google's own devices. It's like arguing about which Windows PC is better. It's like arguing about my Alienware vs your Razer. At the end of the day, we both have Steam on our computers and we use Valve's services. That's what matters most to Valve and to PC gaming as a whole. 

Can we please stop bickering about the ASUS ROG Ally vs Steam Deck and understand that anyone that posts videos comparing them is just doing so for content clicks? I love my SteamDeck and when I first got it, I hated SteamOS and put Windows on there.. it wasn't long after that I started giving SteamOS more of a chance that i ended up regretting putting Windows on it and eventually reverted it all back. Since then I haven't looked back. SteamOS is amazing, and I love the future that it promises for PC gaming. I hope to see official support for SteamOS on the ROG Ally and I can't wait to see what a revised SteamDeck will look like with all these improvements to mobile architecture. It's going to be amazing.",SteamDeck

jic149y,"The Steam Deck is a Linux PC with a controller built into it and features an overlay when you boot it. Apple offered a similar item with Front Row on their Macs in the mid-2000s for iTunes. The Deck is SUPER far from being a console experience since ZERO games are built for the unit itself (or even in mind since it’s a checkbox option at app submission). Total hair split on that comment. 

Also, how would Microsoft and ASUS have a much slower experience getting games to run on the Ally? It’s running Windows 11 on a Ryzen 9 7000 chipset, it’s more powerful and can run Fortnite with no issues. Which is going to be a hit with some PC players. All games are built for Windows, this device will require ZERO work from developers too since the game will still see it as a PC (just like a Proton layer in Steam Deck behaves).

Before you all start downvoting me, there’s NOTHING wrong with the Deck being a handheld PC. In fact, it’s one of its biggest strengths and powered by a Debian-Linux based SteamOS that gives it a special quality. It’s not a mobile phone, tablet or console where it’s a locked experience and developers have to build within the OS and hardware parameters. Valve eliminates all of it thanks to Proton and all the work they do to make Windows games run on this handheld PC.",SteamDeck

The missing link has always been the touchpads.  No one is surprised that a multi-platform game runs well on a controller.  But Valve's goal was to have a universal hardware control interface that covers nearly all PC games on a handheld device.  


Truth is, Valve and these Deck killers are on separate paths of research.  We already know that computers are small enough to run PC games on a handheld.  That wasn't the engineering problem.

The Nintendo Switch is the flagship product of Nintendo when it came out.  It's not some side-project.  


People haven't realized that handheld PC gaming is still a novelty idea.  The Switch wasn't conceived as a handheld PC.  It was a Super DS/Wii U hybrid.  


And GPD making those handheld computers were just a novelty as well.  It didn't spark a product war.  Nobody's excited about a teeny tiny Microsoft Windows desktop for ants.  


Valve created the ecosystem for a Steam games handheld device to be viable.  Built on Linux, yes.  But everything you interface with on the Deck came from Valve's hands.  And a vital part of it are the touchpads.  


Not having touchpads on your Steam Deck killer only tells you that the company isn't really invested in handheld PC gaming.  Only multi-platform PC game releases.  While everyone is still hyped about the Deck.",SteamDeck
ji9ryo0,"Most of the fixes for Ally are universally the same for Windows and especially universal for handheld PCs, which have already been using several community developments.

The only piece of the puzzle that is new is Armory Crate, but I’m fairly certain if this device is native x-input, that armor crate is not even needed, it is just a nice looking overlay that will be plagued with the overlay issues that are already common to windows and (like the big picture mode overlay too or the playnite overlay). 

Anyways, I am on the other end of the spectrum here, there are tons of people that will be jumping ship from their other Windows handheld devices in favor of the ROG Ally.

The reason for this is mostly because of track pads, gyro, and the back buttons being basically essential to me now. After using the steam deck a lot I've noticed those things make some games so much more enjoyable for me. I think there's an argument about broken PC ports too. I'm specifically referring to some PC ports working better on deck than regular computers because of specific updates for the deck + shader caching which makes certain game like elden ring and GTA 4 run better.

ji9giyf,"Battery life is an ill defined metric for PC handhelds. You could ask the following questions:

- What is the least amount of battery life the Ally could have: probably 60 minutes or so. There's no way around it. It's partly physics and partly the fact that there's no artificial limits on performance being imposed. The Ally has a max TDP is 35 watts meaning it has a total system draw of at least 40 watts at that TDP. This measure is also pretty useless, and not something anyone should focus on IMO.

- What will be the battery life at the same TDP as the Steam Deck: round about the same assuming you're running the screen at the same framerate and brightness. So 15 watt TDP would net you around 90 minutes just like the Deck.

- Having everything (game settings, screen refresh rate, fps limit, resolution, and perform) be equal, will the Ally have better or worse battery life: _probably_ better because it should need less TDP in order to hit the same performance. That said the Deck's APU is customized to hit better performance at low TDPs than similar chips, and it's yet unclear if that's also the case with the Z1.",SteamDeck

jiac2he,"I wonder what the impact of Windows is on the battery and performance. Even if the Ally needs less TDP to reach the same performance, Windows is a performance hog compared to Linux. Looking at comparisons of SteamOS vs. W11 games on Deck, I'm seeing SteamOS often run a few frames faster. The Deck is plugged in these examples, so I can't see the power draw on Deck. But I have to imagine it's going to be lower. Less resources need to go the OS.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN6qGFzRivk5pmUSRrvFXRmtrs2_7Al3G

If I had to guess what the ROG Ally is going to be:

* Not as user-friendly as SteamOS
* But you will be able to play everything, as it's Windows
* Comparable to performance/battery life at the same TDP
* It'll be a nice upgrade over the Steam Deck's performance if docked/plugged in, because running at max TDP will drain the battery very quickly. Because no-one ever uses the full extent of the battery capacity (you might only start up the game after you're already down to 95%, then it's 90% by the time you get in game).
* The 120 hz might be nice for less demanding indie games, but for anything more demanding that probably not even reach 120 fps
* It'll do extra well in the regions Valve hasn't expanded too, as ROG will have free range there
* Some Steam Deck users will sell theirs and upgrade to the ROG no doubt. But by selling theirs others will enter the Steam Deck eco-system. So I imagine Valve isn't sweating at all (especially since Steam is also the platform Ally users will most likely buy their games on)
* It's the Chinese handhelds like Aya Neo that should be worried. Unless they change something to make them unique again, they have no more place in the market. There's no reason to buy a more expensive handheld from them to act as your 'Steam Deck Pro', since the Ally will be able to do that much better and with better support",SteamDeck

Yeah, it can take even 15-20 minutes to compile for bigger games on first launch, but that's one time thingy (yeah, after drivers update some of them need recompilation, but it's usually much faster). IIRC shaders can now also be exchanged between users automatically, so there's that.

I'm now on AMD RX 6700XT graphics now on Linux and it improved a whole lot in recent years. Not only the compilation is now much faster (with new graphics pipelines Vulkan extension, some games like GTA V can run smoothly without any precompilation, or the stutters are minor), but usually it downloads pre-compiled shaders transparently and I no longer see the progress bar for shader compilation very often.

The big thing being touted when Valve released the sd is that they trusted people to do with it what they wanted and they built it accepting that it was fine for people to.

They're also great for aiming if that's your style, or setting up various shortcuts.  Pretty much every emulator I run has a trackpad menu, something really cool especially is that the alternate inputs mean I can do something like set one section for a Gameshark button on Mupen 64, but have it pop up the actual Cheat menu if I hold it.

Lemme tell ya, I LOVE playing a game and just being able to instantly without thinking change the disc, doesn't take me out of the experience nearly as much as fumbling around for the keyboard shortcut that I'll never memorize.

I think it's just something that takes a bit of creative thinking.  Like, back-pedal wise, I set it up for Spyro Reignited so I use those instead of the face buttons, and that lets me control the camera and move seamlessly while also charging, jumping, gliding, etc.  Lemme tell ya, I've beaten each of the original trilogy at least 5-6 times each, and that is the BEST way I have ever played Spyro.

In RPGs with controller support I can make a touch menu and map I to inventory, j to quest log, c to character sheet and so on, rather than having to pause and tab through the menus to get to where I want to be.

In RPGs without controller support, I can make a touch menu to use abilities, like when I played dragon age origins, I mapped the number keys to a menu to quickly cast spells without having to move the cursor down to the ability bar. The right trackpad then controls the mouse.

The pads are also amazing for FPS. Right trackpad as mouse for big movements, and then gyro for precise aiming is almost as good as using a mouse. Certainly better than trying to aim with sticks. Any game that has aiming can make great use of this. I mapped right trackpad to mouse and put a gyro activator on it for aiming the bola gun and grenades in Death Stranding for example.

In emulators I use the left pad as a touch menu to save and load savestates without having to use select button combinations that would always open menus in games that have select mapped to menus or a map.

Valve could make a revision of the Deck with better cooling and set the TDP of the APU at 35 watts, and the Deck's minimum battery life would drop to under an hour.

This is (and will always be) an issue (not really an issue IMO) inherent to PC handhelds.",SteamDeck
jia9fkk,Mentioned the same in an older thread. You cannot have more power without less battery life. It was the same with the Steam Deck vs Nintendo Switch. The only way Ally can have the same or better battery life than the Deck is to cram more battery capacity into the Ally's body.,SteamDeck

They can't just analyze it and get all the shaders out of it that way, and what they do get is specific to that exact hardware.

I'm open to corrections, ~~but what I'm trying to say is that you'd be asking for someone to play through on a second device, or maybe even third depending on if the Z1 and Z1 extreme are too different. I know that with some emulators, the concept of a transferable shader cache exists, maybe such a thing is possible here? No idea, some emulators that rely on compiling shaders *don't* allow you to transfer them and I don't know enough to understand how they treat it differently.~~

Games like The Last of Us or Monster Hunter Rise that let you compile shaders at the main menu? Totally though, and I think all that'd have to be done is for someone anywhere to run it, they already get uploaded to Steam I thought.

jib9fq1,Got bad news for you if it’s anything like Genshin,SteamDeck
jibd50u,Yeah looks and runs so much better than my phone or tablet steam deck is probably the best way to play it on the go.,SteamDeck
jibcyjf,It's a gacha but it's pretty fun.,SteamDeck
jibvbkt,"It's a full game. There's gacha in it but characters join you as part of the story and if you just want to play the story you don't have to engage with the gacha elements at all. The most you may have to do is some runs through the roguelite mode. The combat is pretty fun and so far the environments are fun to explore and the story is pretty decent.

If you're categorically opposed to gacha this game probably won't change your mind but if you just want to blaze through a fun turn-based RPG I'd recommend it. It's fully singleplayer so there's no fomo or treadmill but what you make for yourself. That said, the game's been out for like four days, so who knows the pace of new content or if there's a ""wall"". If it's like Genshin I expect that there's no real wall a f2p player would hit if they play at a casual pace but there is if you want to play really hardcore.

tl;dr: Yeah it's gacha but the game is really well polished and entertaining besides.",SteamDeck

jibd2ak,That one disables the anti cheat afaik so I'd just run it on windows.,SteamDeck
jic2f5q,"It doesn't disable the anticheat but patches it, the difference is very technical but you will still get banned if you cheat, it just allows you to play.

On one of the latest updates (I think some patch somewhere in 3.5) you can now play genshin without patching the anticheat, it still works to this day and it's been like that for like a month.

I still recommend the unofficial launcher because it's more streamlined and has more options.",SteamDeck
jic2weg,Wait Genshin works in SteamOS? Real shit? I don't have to use a patched launcher from a back alley?,SteamDeck
jic4q5e,"lol yeah, altho the unofficial launcher is not \*that\* unknown, the community is pretty big and the devs are pretty open.

Keep in mind that the ""official"" way is not as easy to set up and you will probably learn very quickly that the official launcher has MAJOR issues, like a huge memory leak when downloading the game that could lead to the launcher crashing and having to redo it again, and the lack of a performance patch (the unofficial launcher has a performance patch that allows the steam deck to run at lower tdp with relatively good/same performance, extending battery life).",SteamDeck

Liz Truss was ousted and Rishi Sunak was the only one left so he got voted in, once again by the party. What people mean when they say ""no one voted for him"" is that no one voted for him to be PM in an election and the public had no say beyond the election as to who should be leading the country. We as the public voted in a party we think could best run the country at the time (I'm speaking generally, I don't care for the Tories) but the party decide who leads so this allows them to trot out whichever numpty has the most friends in the party, rather than who actually knows what they're doing.",SteamDeck

jic6mwt,"No, it’s not. If you vote for a political party member because they’re in support of a leader with a particular policy position - this leader is then replaced, and so accordingly the party’s position on several policies change - then there’s a reasonable argument to be had that you should be presented with another opportunity to vote given the undemocratic nature of this shift. It being ‘the rules’ doesn’t mean those rules accommodate for the practical reality of the situation, nor does what you’re saying make sense unless reductively interpreted.

ji6go35,Good price but I’ll wait for a bigger discount thanks,SteamDeck
ji6aaqp,its been this price many many times. just a month ago it was this price.,SteamDeck
ji6j2uk,I can’t vouch for this game enough. It is an amazing play on Steam Deck.,SteamDeck
ji6grmv,Waiting for 70% off. that's the bestest,SteamDeck
ji6h4g3,I picked up Grounded. Game looks fun!!,SteamDeck
ji6ublb,"Recommended,  I finished the whole game on the steam deck, ran better than my PC for some reason (more consistent fps and no audio issues)",SteamDeck
ji6vdgv,the remake is supposed to be 3 parts right? and I heard some rumors that the next 2 parts may be exclusive to PS5? will prefer to get them all on the same platform if I could..,SteamDeck
ji6bdcy,Mfw FFVII Remake still costs more than Witcher 3 on release despite being 3 year old game on sale. Maybe I will buy it on -90% sale in 2040.,SteamDeck
ji6j3mu,"Tactics ogre also in that sale. Still expensive, but that seems like a perfect game for the Deck",SteamDeck
ji7d4iy,"For anyone that doesn't care about melting through battery life, there's a great mod on nexus that disabled the dynamic resolution and makes the game feel so much better on deck.",SteamDeck
ji6pwyc,"Originally I was planning on waiting until they had all 4 installments and combined them all in some GOTY edition so I could play the entire game, but that's gonna take years...",SteamDeck
ji6mj2z,"I really wanted to like this game, and i like the graphics and some of the combat. But the story is so boring, the acting is bad, its paced soooo slooowly. Too many sections where youre forced to walk while people talk and it puts me to sleep. I put in about 20hrs in the game and just cant force myself to keep playing",SteamDeck
ji6t65n,FFXII: TZA was the kicker for me. Finally i can try that game without the ridiculous $50 price tag.,SteamDeck
ji6va8p,Saga Frontier worth it? I've never played a Saga game.,SteamDeck
ji6yhue,It was the first new game I bought and played for exclusively on my Deck.  Runs and plays great!,SteamDeck
ji8b2vc,I got mine yesterday. Dropped over 300 on steam. To be honest I hate these sales. Not that it’s bad for them but bad for my wallet,SteamDeck
ji6wr30,"I want the Remake, but I need the whole game not the first half of the first disc.",SteamDeck
ji6gn9z,And yet still not worth it.,SteamDeck
ji6mdw7,"i got FFXV for 20 bucks and i play that until FF7R is down to a similar price, i guess

edit: ffxv btw is 100gb (with add-on) so i basically had to throw out most of the games on my deck. oof.",SteamDeck
ji6m033,"I'd wait. It's a dull graphics showcase that is best played on a big screen, if you have to play it.",SteamDeck
ji76879,"I happily got this game at christmas for 7 bucks from epic. coupled with the sale, ten dollar off voucher and a gift card…*I* technically only paid 7 bucka",SteamDeck
ji7lfxf,Most I'll pay for FF7 Remake is $30 CAD. That's about the most I'll pay for about all games except for a few exceptions.,SteamDeck
ji6qc2z,OG FF7 fan here begging you all to do yourselves a favor and buy/play the original instead. You can thank me later.,SteamDeck
ji76sk2,The game is still too steep… for how old it is…,SteamDeck
ji78x24,"Heads-up for anyone interested in the original FF7. It requires you to sign in to a Square Enix account on first launch. It's not the most egregious form of DRM, but it's worth noting.

Also, I've read that the authentication servers sometimes have problems, making playing the game impossible if you haven't done the initial setup. I can't say for sure how often this happens. I would suggest a quacked copy or use the PS1 version on DuckStation.

And the remake, despite being one of SquareEnix's crappier PC ports, doesn't have any cumbersome DRM like Denuvo or mandatory sign ins, so, have fun.",SteamDeck
ji79od0,It's only 11 % off the 60$ cad$ price point it should have been at I am not supporting these practices,SteamDeck
ji7le3a,Oh man. I wish I had the money for it. Broke atm :(,SteamDeck
ji7v7dr,Literally just bought it at full price… 2 days ago haha,SteamDeck
ji6cob7,I really want to Buy games instead of pirating games... But dud the prices are killing me.,SteamDeck
ji6i4lq,"Before I pay  45€ (79.99 msrp? for a remake?) they completely insane, I´d rather play 3x upscaled emulator holy f",SteamDeck
ji7923j,54% off if you are a gold member.  Stack 2% off coupon for another whopping 1% off!,SteamDeck
ji6jnm1,I just spent way too much on this sale.,SteamDeck
ji6q10r,Yeah I think ill wait until it dips below 20.,SteamDeck
ji6rxk6,https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-pc/,SteamDeck
ji867z3,"I played through this recently on Deck and really enjoyed it. I beat the original remake on PS4 Pro but never got to play Intermission since I didn't pick up a PS5, so that was an entertaining side story after I replayed the main game.

The game runs well on the Deck. I usually had between 30-40fps, with the occasional 50-60 in some areas. Some people are more sensitive to changes in fps than I am so may want to lock it to 30, but I enjoyed it without the lock. Played it on my TV while docked some of the time too and it looked good (albeit nowhere near as good as Crisis Core Reunion on my Series X, but I didn't expect it to do that anyway). Looked excellent on the Deck's screen.

Side note: this was the first 3D AAA game I played on my Deck since getting it at Christmas so I got my first exposure to seeing how quickly the battery could run down 😂. Remote Play from Xbox, emulated games, and even Tactics Ogre all had nothing on the battery power consumed by a game like this. I ended up investing in a 100W portable battery and a new 100W extension cable for use near my couch (easier to charge the Deck, phones, etc without so many cords and adapters all over).",SteamDeck
ji8f1m1,I got it for the same price around Christmas,SteamDeck
ji8h188,Tried it but the game lag for me here and here.,SteamDeck
ji9122u,"This ""sale"" price is what it should actually cost by now.",SteamDeck
ji9jpil,"I can wait a little longer for it to get a little lower, I just picked up both of the NieR games, that should keep me going for awhile.",SteamDeck
ji9ra65,Where?,SteamDeck
ji9xqmf,"Game is at 43% discount but given it's a $70 game, doesn't feel like a discount. Still feels expensive for what it is.",SteamDeck
ji6mk95,"Yeah, I saw the the 43%, I was like wow, at last. And then I saw the remaining price and oof.",SteamDeck
ji6xvw9,I'm waiting till the entire game is done. This is just the game up until you leave Midgar,SteamDeck
ji7axql,"It's 93+ tax in Canada. 43% off isn't really a big enough discount for me, it just makes it a $50-$60 game, and my budget is about half that per month for games",SteamDeck
ji708c9,"dont count on it to happen with FF titles, in all the years I have seen SE on Steam, I noticed they have never or if very rarely gone down below 50%",SteamDeck
ji71dvn,No one asked thanks,SteamDeck
ji7f2vt,Same. I already paid full price once when it first came out on PS4.,SteamDeck
ji6gjvi,"It was technically this price on its Steam launch day. At least, it's how much I paid on GreenManGaming. Their sale put it at $50 and they had a coupon for $10 more off that anyone could use. Shit I actually paid a little less. 39.75 vs this sales 39.89",SteamDeck
ji6wrwe,"Yeah, I think this price has been offered before. I plan on waiting for a bigger discount, or to buy it 5 years from now when the rest of the game is included.",SteamDeck
ji9cvyl,"Huh, that good. This is the first sale of it I've noticed, but I don't watch the store like a hawk. I had added it to my wish list recently and got notified of the sale this time.",SteamDeck
ji6lfbf,"Is it though? It's a pretty taxing game, I tried to run the epic store version through hero launcher ~9 months ago and it was a stutter 15-20 fps mess",SteamDeck
ji6wn83,95% or I walk,SteamDeck
ji7j3lh,\*cursed finger curls\* its 70% off of a 5 year old game that they still sell for 80 MSRP,SteamDeck
ji6vmwp,I want it betterer than that. Betterer!,SteamDeck
ji71cp6,The genre of gamers that make waiting for discounts on games their entire personality is so obnoxious lmfao,SteamDeck
jiawyc7,"Sadly, square enix game never get under 50% sales.

They might have done a 60% discount once but that's pretty much it :/",SteamDeck
ji701x6,I got that game when it came out and am terrified of it. I got chased into the lab by a wolf spider blocking the hallway to the exit. I shut the game down and never turned it back on…I have 12 hours in that game and bought it 3 years ago. I have learned there is a mode to make them non violent now so I may jump back on to try that…maybe I can get past the look of the spiders if they aren’t trying to attack me. I know there is an arachnophobia mode but that doesn’t help much when they still lunge at you.,SteamDeck
ji772qb,"They will for sure be Sony exclusive at launch, like FF16 and FF7R.",SteamDeck
ji9ds6s,"So...until I read this I didn't realize it was a 3 part game, only 1 of which is out currently...it took a good while to convince myself to pay $40 for this, but paying $40 for only 1/3 of the game...I might need to reconsider",SteamDeck
ji6mgtp,In my region Gun Gun Pixies costs 1.5x Elden Ring and 2x Witcher 3 GOTY lol,SteamDeck
ji6s751,tbf the port only came out like. less than a year ago on steam,SteamDeck
ji73hy6,Have you seen what square is charging for the FF pixel remaster set? Lol,SteamDeck
ji7by5q,Oooh shit. I couldn't bring myself to pay full price when I already have the PSP version on my deck. But now I'm tempted. Amazing game. Any Final Fantasy Tactics fans who haven't played it should seek it out.,SteamDeck
ji7q78q,"It’s a great game in its own, it doesn’t feel like an incomplete game. The amount of care and detail they put into it is astounding if you’re a fan of the original.",SteamDeck
ji75i4e,"I’m of the mindset that this remake is nothing but a cash grab. I played it on ps4 when it came out and was severely disappointed in what they did to the story and battle mechanics. It’s a corridor runner with 20 hrs of filler and 20 hrs of legit content. I was a huge fan of the original (beat it 7+ times since 1997)… I had to force myself to play through this. 6/10 at best. There’s much better games out there for much less money.

Edit: Nier Automata is on sale right now. I would pick that if I was looking for a game with a great story and great game mechanics.",SteamDeck
ji7fhk2,">But the story is so boring, the acting is bad, its paced soooo slooowly.

It's almost like they took the first five (and arguably least-interesting) hours of a preexisting game and tried to pad it out into a full-length RPG...",SteamDeck
ji7gxb6,Great game,SteamDeck
ji6j94f,"I think it is worth it if you enjoy it, but it'll certainly be cheaper in the future if you're happy to wait. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives that are just as worthy of your time",SteamDeck
ji6klab,I agree.  Ff7 will be good game once done 100% I won't touch this game until then.,SteamDeck
ji6mwev,Even on the Turkey Market its still round about 30€. Still too much for me.,SteamDeck
ji81nac,Nobody cares,SteamDeck
ji6ruzq,"I think the remake is worth playing, but it changes so much that you should experience the original first. Similarly, I’m glad I got around to playing the original RE4 before the remake dropped.",SteamDeck
ji6x4k0,"I played ff7 when it was new and recently. Look, I loved it back in the day. It was all me and my friends would talk about but it hasn't aged that well. I'm not just talking about gfx either. Begging people not to play a modern day remake that has been well received ain't it.",SteamDeck
ji6s2rx,"I agree with this, the remake is not a replacement for the original story wise",SteamDeck
ji6u4du,Thank you. I've never beaten a final fantasy and #7 is top on my list to try. I'll go OG first,SteamDeck
ji7r4qf,"Remake is great for anyone , most people won’t go back and play the og if they’ve never played a final fantasy. But they might after playing remake.",SteamDeck
ji81j3m,"Then give up gaming lmao. It's not gonna change. In fact if game prices followed the change in cost of development&inflation, they'd quite easily be 110-120 a piece for the ""basic editions"" and even then that's really fucking cheap compared to 75$ of other hobbies. Ever get into cars? Surfing? Woodworking? Yeah, gaming is far cheaper. I'm fine with the prices and they're not gonna go down bud. So either accept it and continue gaming or give up the hobby lmao.",SteamDeck
ji7w8ln,Steam will refund it for you. There’s literally a reason choice for this.,SteamDeck
ji6gr8t,Especially as physical games go away. There will be no reason for deep sales.,SteamDeck
ji6iwwk,"It's a totally different experience, and very much worth it IMO.",SteamDeck
ji6l0qq,"Same here. Why would one pay for game that's only 25% complete of its original game.  

By the time this game is complete,  it will be in 4 parts and will cost 300€£$ if not more.",SteamDeck
ji7jwh6,Yup! I'm going to wait till all FF7 remake games come out at this point lol,SteamDeck
ji91845,"After all this time since the original PS5 release, it's a $40 game. They're just charging what the game is actually worth and calling it a sale.",SteamDeck
ji6yemq,See you in 2035,SteamDeck
ji6y8tx,Yeah but they expanded Midgard which I think was a good idea,SteamDeck
ji72ef1,"It’s a lot more detailed than the original first disc. I had about 40 hours in remake when I was done, and that’s before doing the expansion that added Yufi’s story. People thinking it’s going to be $70 when all three parts are out are out of their gourd. I’m sure a sale might get it there, or when it’s old.",SteamDeck
ji71ehx,Midgar*,SteamDeck
ji6yjzr,Up until Midgard!? So will there be like 9 games? That's like 15% into it. Holy smokes. They gonna make the whole series like $1000!,SteamDeck
ji8rx01,"Ehh. No spoilers, but it's not a 1:1 remake. Don't use the previous game as a benchmark.",SteamDeck
ji7e1vy,Ok,SteamDeck
ji6l7np,technically 39.75 in the past would be of higher value.,SteamDeck
ji8gqdn,"I didn’t get it on Steam, but I got FF 7 “free” with my PS Plus membership, which has been awesome. But with Steam I made out like a bandit during the holiday sale. Got the entire Fallout series, sans Fallout 76. Plus Half Life 1 & 2, Oblivion, and ES Online with all expansions for about $60. 🙂👍",SteamDeck
ji6w3cc,Inflations a bitch,SteamDeck
ji6n5pj,"Haha that’s exactly what I did too, such a good ass deal and I’m happy I did that.",SteamDeck
ji706hp,You mean the second tenth,SteamDeck
ji6o0vq,"I wouldn’t say it’s amazing but it’s certainly good enough, you can get a solid 30/40FPS depending on settings. The dynamic resolution can get a little aggressive at time, but it’s certainly very playable, great for knocking out the side quests in those chapters",SteamDeck
ji6q1tl,"I'm getting solid 40fps most of the time with the dynamic resolution off. With it on (default) it's possible to even get 50-60fps but sometimes it can get blurry but very very playable and still looks good. 

It performs well",SteamDeck
ji6q11t,"learn how to adjust your bleedin deck settings then, it aint hard, im getting around 49-60FPS easily with settings adjusted",SteamDeck
ji6uyqd,"Quacked version runs at 45fps for me, which should run similar to the epic store version, where both dont have the steam deck shader cache",SteamDeck
ji7z9vc,Some stutters here and there but mostly 30-40fps for my playthrough,SteamDeck
jiaytue,There are nexusmods optimizations that makes the game much better too,SteamDeck
ji7387a,I don’t think it’s possible to get it more than 90% off even if Square Enix wanted. Didn’t Valve make a rule that no longer allowed games to be discounted more than 90% off last year?,SteamDeck
ji7dloc,"That isn't what a genre is. A better word might be ""subset"" or something similar.",SteamDeck
ji80xc1,"I'm kinda with you on that though lol. Always those kinds when you're like ""hey, plan on grabbing ff16 day one or maybe grab the new borderlands to play together?"" And they're always like ""nah man, I'm about to start ff15 finally, it was on sale. New borderlands? Nah ima wait til it's 10$ and by then you'll have been done with it for 2 years and won't care to play it with me""",SteamDeck
ji7fpm8,"Lol, I've heard of the spiders. I haven't had a chance to get full into it yet because I've also been playing Alien Fire team but the horror of the spiders has reached",SteamDeck
ji9eupx,"It was sometime back but I read that the remaining two parts *could* be console exclusive instead of timed exclusive. There were some debates over it. I didn't really looked into it though

Or maybe I mixed it up with FFXVI",SteamDeck
jiad1uw,"It's still a 35 hour game, with a 5 hour DLC. The story felt complete to me, but I don't know the original game.",SteamDeck
ji7nnfu,I love FFT but was very let down by Tactics Ogre. I wouldn't put them in the same league.,SteamDeck
ji7zlsu,It's less of a corridor runner than the portion of the original game it covers...,SteamDeck
ji6mvwy,"Silly position. It’s a large, full length game that is longer than the whole PS1 OG. 
Also it’s so long that I got really burnt on it and won’t play any sequels just because I got tired of Final Fantasy.   Wasted 85 hours to plat + 10 hours on Yuffie.

I mean, it’s silly to purposely avoid it for the sole reason it’s not the full OG story. It’s a different game with its own story loosely based on the OG, but has its own beginning, middle and endgame so you finished a whole large game when you finished Part 1.",SteamDeck
ji9jtds,"I do, so you’re wrong.",SteamDeck
ji8b6hh,Aww hugs!,SteamDeck
ji84the,"In the case of 7R, it changes *too* much.",SteamDeck
ji84n0j,"**Highly** disagree. I think FF7 has aged exceptional well, far better than the Remake will. OG is timeless, but 7R just feels like a product of its time. Shallow, uninspired, drawn out.",SteamDeck
ji8512s,"Exactly. Currently, there is no possible way they can follow the same story with the sequels. It just cannot happen with changes that were made.",SteamDeck
ji8dqln,I'm old now I can wait a couple years for games to go on sale,SteamDeck
ji6h8xx,Physical sales have nothing to do with digital discounts. Otherwise historically steam sales just wouldn't be a thing. Games compete with each other for sales much more than with themselves on different media.,SteamDeck
ji6j3dn,"PC games have had deep discounts for over 10 years. I see no reason for this trend not to continue, especially since there are thousands of great games that are accessible on PC. Competition is too high for games to not compete on price",SteamDeck
ji6mp0b,"It is safe to say this years after the release: FF7 Remake is not really a remake, but a sequel to both original FF7 and the whole Compilation.",SteamDeck
ji8hrrz,Yeah there are already too many upcoming games I'm excited about to fall down the ff7 rabbit hole. Definitely want to pick it up in the future though.,SteamDeck
ji6yzfv,/r/patientgamers,SteamDeck
ji7dbac,"As someone that grew up on the og, i'l be hitting around pension age then. So i'm fine with that.",SteamDeck
ji7fd0y,!remindme 12 years,SteamDeck
ji71m0u,Midgar*,SteamDeck
ji7b8pp,"Three games. 

Seems like you haven't played it so I don't want to spoil things, but it's a little more complicated than a straight remake. I think they said we'll visit all the locations, but not necessarily in the same context.",SteamDeck
ji7fgen,It’s hard to talk about this without spoilers but the end of the game have you insight on how your 15% estimate might be irrelevant.,SteamDeck
ji718kh,Modern Square is super greedy and scummy,SteamDeck
ji70ekx,"They already stated the game will be in 3 Parts  
First is up to escape of Midgaurd  
Second would be I guess >!death of Aerith !<  
Third would be the rest of the game  
EDIT: I went ahead and tagged the ""spoiler""but seriously, if some of you people expect everyone to tip toe around and spoiler tag 26 year old info... you are ridiculous.",SteamDeck
ji76nup,[deleted],SteamDeck
jib3rv4,Yeah it's more of a spin off.,SteamDeck
ji6mmzp,Damn technicalities. Getting everyone in this thread.,SteamDeck
ji72nkr,"lol , pretty much true. its a 20 year title.",SteamDeck
ji6oiv2,"Good to hear! I regret buying it on epic, it's a game I want in my steam library but its way too expensive to consider buying twice, even on sale 😔 still need to finish that hard playthrough & start the DLC",SteamDeck
ji74542,Sounds like I am walking then,SteamDeck
ji8sep7,Well maybe you can think of it another way that your friend unforunately didn't play with youu in Borderlands but they did save monies by not buying a game they may never play and probably took you out to lunch / dinner / movies whatever with the monies they saved.,SteamDeck
jiajwur,"I ended up keeping it. The reviews are great for a reason, so I'll trust that. I'm just gonna hate having to wait 3-5 years for the other ones to come out :(",SteamDeck
ji7pise,Did you play this new version? I decided not to buy it after reading about some of the odd changes they made.,SteamDeck
ji6v6rh,"Isn't the original over 100 hours if you try and do everything, like how you tried to do everything (for the plat trophy) in the remake? Wouldn't that make the part 1 remake shorter than the OG",SteamDeck
ji6w5kk,"Longer than the original for the wrong reasons, many would argue.",SteamDeck
ji878ck,Those are your rose tinted glasses,SteamDeck
ji6mgs3,Do some research and look at steam sales 10 years ago. You will be shocked how good the deals got. Especially when steam had flash sales.,SteamDeck
ji6rs1g,"This. It's an entire different experience and that ""It's just blablabla % of the original game"" narrative is totally obsolete at this point, because it isn't even really a remake of the original game.

ji7lt8g,So.... winter 2024 for pc,SteamDeck
ji6p24b,"Yeah I know I bought it at the 35~% off price which is still quite expensive😭No regrets once I started playing though, finished it 3 times now(PS4 Normal/Hard, PC Normal), that soundtrack has a hold over me 😂 You might be able to get better performance on the Epic one nowadays, the newer Protons might have helped. I waited for Steam for the cloud saves between my Deck and PC mainly, it’s still a bit flaky in heroic",SteamDeck
ji6u1uu,Same. Bought it on EGS before I got my Deck and not completely satisfied with how it runs. For some reason I struggle to get refresh rate and max framerate to work with non-Steam games installed/launched through Heroic.,SteamDeck
ji6ysnf,"Intermission was really good, I'd recommend playing that before Hard Mode replay.",SteamDeck
ji725pl,Still better than 3 copies of elden ring!,SteamDeck
ji72v6y,"I played using HoloISO on a Ryzen 2400G and VRAM set to 4GB in BIOS (the game would randomly crash with less). Low settings, 720p, locked at 30 fps. Played the whole game on it except for Yufi’s story. I need to finish that one of these days.",SteamDeck
ji8soeu,"That's actually pretty fair. Guess I'm more salty about this specific situation than the concept itself lol. I've picked up plenty of games on sales that I wanted to play but didn't want to pay. Helps having the deck. But yeah that's a valid point, thank you 🙏",SteamDeck
jiatjuz,Yea. I would also advise playing the game capped at 40 FPS in the steamdeck. The game runs great aside from a few sections that have heavy assets loading in. Luckily frames are always capped in combat.,SteamDeck
jiavrkw,"you can always check out the original game, it's on steam and making it work with 7th heaven on steam deck shouldn't be too hard",SteamDeck
ji8bzne,"I played the new version on switch, about 10 hours so nowhere near finishing it. I never played any previous versions.

I did not like the buff card system at all. It also seems like you can't mix/match class abilities like FFT. It was disappointing and the FFT itch goes unscratched for decades now.",SteamDeck
ji70yfy,"Going for the plat was my mistake tbh, completely needless waste of time. The game was about 50 hours long IIRC? Which seems a bit longer than the original without endgame grind.",SteamDeck
ji88kp3,"Incorrect. Something **can** be good, despite its age. Blaming nostalgia is just a common dismissal of people who don't value good storytelling.

jiazxln,"I ended up buying it 😅😅 I wanted the steam achievements!! And if there's any save-transfer capability with the sequel I'd buy the sequel on steam too. 

I tested it for maybe 10m yesterday and it seems to run pretty damn well! 40 fps most of the time (it's on default settings, high), some occasional dips in cutscenes but I might just be building the shader cache. Wonder how it'll hold up in the town and against el scorpion.. will play more today! I got RE4R running at 40 fps consistently too without it looking like Vaseline, this is a crazy machine.",SteamDeck

ji7bft5,"The irony is I'd be very surprised if she still dies this time around. 

Like what did people always want to discover in FFVII? a way to save her. The theme of the game is challenging fate, etc. There's like no way she dies again. 

someone will, though.",SteamDeck

ji79dnt,"sorry you did not know, but you cant expect something to be spoiler free forever, this info is 26 years old at this point",SteamDeck
ji79m3a,"Like I said, the remake made it so that there are a lot of new players who haven't played the original. So for them it's not a 26 year old game, for them it's 3 years old. 
Besides, it doesn't matter, it take such little effort, all you had to do was maybe say sorry and then edit it and add the spoiler tag instead of doubling down. Being nice doesn't take that much effort and makes everyone happy.",SteamDeck

Whats the max wattage you reach when playing? Should show in the full overlay.

I assume around 30w though at most. Which, even if the voltage drops a bit, is well with in the SDs battery capability to deliver.

jic1wgh,"I bought the 64gb model and a 1TB sd card and was going to call it a day. But after seeing many YouTube videos and how easy it is to swap the SSD I mustered the courage to change the SSD myself and upgraded to 1TB, so I now have 2TB machine, for much less, they only give you half that storage for the price it cost me. Have a look and see what you feel like doing",SteamDeck
jibwkrr,"If you not comfortable getting the 256gb and adding an sd card soudns like teh bst bet. Especially since Amazon been selling 512gb sd cards for just under $40 lately. 

If you really needed to had every possible game available right then and there then 64GB and then upgrade.

I'm rarely not around wifi so didn't need to upgrade to a 1TB SSD, but I did on one of my SD's and there's a bit of a slight regret as never needed it, never need to risj opening it and messing up something (things happen). Really surprised how well just the sd card larges just fine even games like Elden Ring. What ever is more comfortable for you and that is actually practicle for what you want/need.",SteamDeck
jibyksj,"The actual upgrade is super, super easy, I would class myself as super clumsy too. However it really took no time at all. Opening the case is the hardest part, you simply need to do it very slowly till it unclips. I was more concerned damaging the case. but once it popped, the rest was easy.

I had bigger issues using the recovery key supplied by steam.  It just didnt work for the first two attempts. It is provided ""as is"", and is full of bugs. Even when it did install the wifi then bugged out (caused again by the recovery OS usb stick) bug. 

I now have a 1tb ssd and a 1tb sd card for the deck. 

The better option I learned was simply get an enclosure for the existing ssd and clone it to the new drive. (i learned this after I did it mind you).

Just use care when opening the steam deck case, take your time with the screws, and put a soft towel down while working on the back, or even use the case as a holder while doing it. The actual ssd enclosure should just slip straight off and even on the 1tb drive it went straight back on, you dont need to pry it apart. 

I really dont like doing these type of upgrades, I shouldnt have to after purchasing it so soon. But the end result was worth it. Even 512gb is not enough. I think they were a bit shortsighted on the storage option, considering average game sizes.",SteamDeck

jibywts,"I get that the uprgade is easy to do, I just dont like opening my consoles plus, ssd's are very expensive where i live",SteamDeck
jibzapz,"it wasnt cheap here either, I paid $200 for the ssd.

I never open consoles, Im not a console person full stop, steam deck is my first console.  Its just screws, a silver enclosure and a metal shield for the drive. Just use a soft towel when placing the deck on its screen.

I had more issues restoring the unit via provided usb image from steam than anything else.

I wish you luck either way. But 512gb is not enough for games. Forza 4/5 use 300gb on their own. I literally ran out of space so fast.

Also if you buy a micro sd, get a high speed branded one, there are few recommended ones i believe, they are expensive $100 for the slow ones, (decent), or $200 for the super fast ones. But dont cheap out on the sd card, waste of money. The cheap chinesium ones will be too slow. (if they even work).

Its also a bit bad when to take full advantage of the steam deck you need to fork out $400 in storage options. (optional of course).

I wish you the best of luck either way! Let peeps know what you do in the end!",SteamDeck

Both cards get good reviews for speed. just make sure its a genuine one. I havent seen a 2tb one, so i cant comment on that. i was amazed a 1tb one existed.

A lot of the fakes come from aliexpress and ebay to name a few, so beware.

The average price of genuine 1tb cards is around $75-200. So if its cheap, it might be too cheap. its mostly speed/budget at $100 and the fastest is around $250",SteamDeck

SteamDeck has shown me how far proton has come and most of my games will work.  I still have some like Hunt Showdown that won’t no matter what due to anti cheat.  I’d prefer to be on macOS as it is closer to what I need than Linux but I am so done with windows it isn’t even funny. I just don’t want to keep booting back and forth and I don’t want two pcs as I work and game equally and I am used to gaming with multiple monitors so I can keep an eye on work stuff on other screens.",SteamDeck

My brain correlates my PC with work so I try to avoid it in my free time but Steam Deck from factor tricks me & I can enjoy *20+ hours of wandering in a igavania* <- so there’s that.",SteamDeck
ji751oi,"Old console gamer here (started with Pong) that stopped with the Sony PS3 with life getting busy, work, wife, daughter. Although I have a Switch I wanted to get back into gaming at my old age and didn’t know anything about the steam deck as I considered my first gaming PC as I know I couldn’t pull off a console attached to a TV as my daughter is 5 and wife won’t let us game to much yet…

Heard about steam deck and never considered a pc gaming laptop. The perfect form factor to be able to travel as I have a virtual job since 2011 and some business travel. 

I’ve enjoyed many AAA games, Steam is my primary source for games but some on others such as epic etc… deals are so amazing in the steam deck and as old gamer that stoped with PS3 many games are so inexpensive to catch up on games I missed that are under $5.

Emulator mode is amazing as I can also play games from my PS2 and PS3 days again… such a blast…. 

For me I game maybe 30 mins a night and while in business tracker. I also have Madden 23 or i5 her emulated sport games that I do CPU vs CPU and can steam link to my iPad or iPhone while at work (virtual job) or while doing dishes. Always fun to have a football game running on the background! Haha!

I also had gamepass for the steam deck and found several games that I ended up buying for the my daughter for when she gets older and have snuck a few around a of games with us this past few months. Disneyland Adventure cost me $5 on sale and I think it’s one of the best deals ever for me as it has endless possibilities for my daughter who loves princesses and each of the mini games are things she can play and learn. That game has a very high production value with so much to collect and do I see it being her favorite for years… — stopped the Xbox subscription service but admit it worked flawlessly with internet access and truly blew my mind.. if I gamed more I would have likely considered keeping the subscription as it has so much I would likely play and the monthly rate would be worth it. 

Subscription vs Buy

But the way I play buying a game for $5 Disneyland Adventures, or snow runner for $15 and Yakuza 0 for $5 and Yakuza like a dragon for $18, and Mass Effect Legendary for $15 were better deals for me as I can play anytime I want and many would be games that I want time to play so owning made sense.

New Gaming Markets 

Older Generation

The deck also to me has a interesting new untapped market of aging gamers who literally grew up and with the beginning of the home gaming systems of the early 70’s that now can game on a deck. We are a generation that has seen it all from the game of pong a dot and two paddles to the open world games of enormous proportions! The realism… wow!

New Parents 

The other market is the new Mom and Dad. Many new parents can game again with very limited time. Balancing work, family, and home life can be hard and the steam deck like the Nintendo switch allows portable gaming and connection to a monitor, tv and controllers… the prefect balance for new parents!

Closing 

Sorry for writing an essay but I love the steam deck for what it can offer. Maybe NOT the most advanced gaming system ever, could use a better screen with less bezel, would love a slightly smaller form factor such as the switch size but it is a revolutionary device that can do way more than expected and can bring a variety of men and women to gaming again or to gaming as newbies. 

Gaming is an art not just the old 70’s - mid 90s when gaming was likely not seen as being cool and people would grow out of gaming. The uncool part is gone a bit now as gaming is a massive business today and Boys, girls, men, and women can all be gaming in whatever way they want which is the most beautiful part of seeing this art transform our imaginations. 

Game On!",SteamDeck
ji75an8,Yes I actually play them now,SteamDeck

ji75wuf,"my main change has really been what I get games for.  
I have my Gaming PC, Deck, and Switch  
If it was ain indie game, I would before get it on Switch if it was there, sao I could play it portable if I wanted to.  Now I can get it on Steam instead, and still have that portable factor.  My rule now is digital only? Steam, Physical, Switch",SteamDeck

ji76w1j,"I have recently started playing RDR2 after finding an optimization vid on YouTube. I have to say playing story games on it is definitely much better, then sitting in a chair for hours. Much better to just lay down cover yourself however you want, and let the time fly by.",SteamDeck
ji774m0,I now have a living room console,SteamDeck
ji77640,I will go lay down for bed an hour or so earlier just to play some game before I go to sleep. Wife hates it. Also been finishing more games and finishing off ones I already put a lot of time into.,SteamDeck

ji78zsc,Now I can play 😂,SteamDeck
ji79ddu,"Completely revived my passion for gaming. I have been waiting for years for something like the Deck. Being in a Desk playing games just wasn't doing it for me anymore and I always had a passion for handhelds.

I still used my Vita, PSP and Nintendo's consoles before the Deck way more than my desktop. 

Now I finish games and I'm in love with the thing. It's such an exciting era for me, I truly couldn't be happier about Steam Deck's existence. I waited years for it and now i finally have it.",SteamDeck
ji79g3r,"I game more in general. SteamOS' suspend feature makes me more comfortable being wrapped up in a game while in a waiting room or commuting. Provided it's a game you can actually pause, lol. I play a lot of PSO2 on it so I still sometimes need to be mindful that I may need to log out at any moment.",SteamDeck
ji7a9k9,I play a ton of games I missed out on years ago (mainly PS2/PS3). The fact that we now have a handheld that plays these types of games is insane.,SteamDeck

And the laptop, I’d need to plug it in, find my controller, wait for it to boot up, and keep one eye on the plug because it is guaranteed to fall out of either the wall or the computer at some point. A book is frictionless by comparison. 

The Deck, I can be playing Celeste in two minutes. A much more fair contest between the two.",SteamDeck

ji7e5h2,I get to play more in my small amounts of free time like before a class or at night when I don’t feel like booting up my PC for 20-30 minutes. I also have been more consistent in games with daily commissions actually doing them because it’s easier with the Steam Deck.,SteamDeck
ji7e78i,"My computer is a little more powerful than my Steam Deck (obviously), but there are times where I'll take the progress of one game and then continue it on my Steam Deck on my 55 inch OLED TV.

I've also had times where my gf is playing on my PS4 and I'll sit next to her, headphones in, playing Resident Evil 4 on the deck. I absolutely love this device and I know I'll get Steam Deck 2.",SteamDeck
ji7eekx,I hate desks,SteamDeck
ji7ewy7,I WFH most of the time now since lockdown and so the last thing I want to do after spending the day working on the pc is to sit infront of it some more.

I enjoy relatively few drama tv shows and movies as I’m easily distracted, only really liking sports and documentaries which she doesn’t watch.",SteamDeck

ji7i4jc,I beat games. I also play on my lunch break,SteamDeck
ji7icfp,I play before bed way more and have found I get through my backlog easier because I only have 1-2 games on my deck at a time. I also use controller at my pc way more because I don’t want to go from K&M then back to controller when swapping between my pc and the deck.,SteamDeck

I even own an Xbox Series X and a PS5. Only really use the Xbox Series X for DBD and a few other multiplayer games.

PS5 I only really have for Sony exclusives and Silent Hill 2.

Other than that, I don't really find myself interested to play single player games on the TV. I love the deck cause I can pick it up play for 30 mins and just suspend it.

That's what I love about handheld gaming it isn't intrusive.

ji8pz96,I sold my 3080 build and got myself a Steam Deck. Genuinely one of the best decisions I've made not because I can play more (being a father and all) and even take it with me. I'm able to enjoy playing again without needing to leave my family into a dedicated room. Plus it gives me the opportunity to play with my wife with a dock so yeah.

Pretty much I now buy all games I would buy digitally on Steam.  I still buy physical for the Switch or PS5 but digital is all a Steam thing.

I also sometimes double up during good sales like rebuying Control and Witcher 3 since I find handheld to be easier for me to really play than a console connected to the PC.  

I also finally beat a couple of games so far that I bought on the PS4 that I got while doubling up on Steam.",SteamDeck

jiahpfo,"I'm gaming more now. My living situation used to be that I lived with my wife and her parents for a bit so I was always gaming on my laptop, then my nintendo switch started taking over. We got our own place around 18 months ago, sold the laptop and got a desktop back but life took over and I was barely motivated to go sit at a desk and play my PC. Didn't like taking over the TV to play my ps4 and xbox either (my own issues really) so primarily ended up playing my switch but still missed some of the games I had on PC.

Got a SD, now I PC game a lot more and I've even got PS remote play and xbox cloud gaming set up on it so it's enabling me to play all platforms. Currently I'm mostly using it to play a mix of the Classic Tomb Raiders and Streaming Horizon Forbidden West.

So I guess it's made gaming a lot more accessible to me where I don't have to go sit at my desk in a random room, when I've spent all day sat at a desk at work.",SteamDeck

In other words, it means that buying something new can cause a chain reaction of buying more and more things because the new item makes you feel like you need other things to go with it or to keep up with it. This can lead to overspending and accumulating more possessions than you actually need or use.

ji9805t,"Not a ""dumb linux noob"" question, don't worry. You have been used to a different operative system and it is absolutely common to have this questions when adapting to a new environment. 

You were right with your assumption, in linux they are called system links (or symlinks, to abbreviate).

Here in the penguin kingdom there are two types of system links: soft links and hard links.

Soft links behave exactly the same as you have been used to shortcuts in windows, at least in the practical part: they are files that point to the original file which sits somewhere else in the system, and behave just like the original for the rest of the system. They are just a link between the current path and the original file. Soft links can also be folders.

Hard links, on the other hand, are a little more difficult to explain. Hard links in essence do the same thing, but they have an special property: instead of pointing to the original file directory (path), they point to the actual memory position of the file itself in the disk/drive. This translates in to the system viewing both files (the original and the hardlinked) as independent, unconnected files, like if they both were original. If you were going to delete the original file, the hardlinked one will continue to exist and be functional, while at the same time changes done in one of the two files propagates to the other as both, remember, utilize the same memory position. Hard links can never be a folder.

In any case, if you are wondering which one to use, just go with soft links. Indeed, KDE's desktop environment (the desktop mode interface) by default only shows softlinks when dragging a file/folder to another directory (as ""link here"").

Hope it helped you to make things clearer!",SteamDeck
ji93qye,"A Windows shortcut is a link at the OS level that sends you to the destination.

A symlink is a link at the filesystem level and is almost the same as the primary link to the file itself. It's much more powerful than a Windows shortcut, because for most programs, they will treat it as identical to the file itself.

>Can I delete the link I made on the desktop to a folder that exists elsewhere and not delete the original folder in the process?

Yup. The original link to the folder will still exist. That one is called a hard link, as opposed to the symlink that you created.

While you can create another hard link to the data, it's better to use symlinks because hard links can't cross filesystems.",SteamDeck
jiak8wv,"There is no exact alternative. Links, that you mentioned, were explained already, and indeed they are not the same as shortcuts, in many ways (most noticeable - you can't set a custom icon to a link, you can set different starting folder, you can't have some extra starting parameters, etc). And there is no exact alternative, because linux family is very big, they all share the same kernel, but the rest may be very different, and major difference in regards to shortcuts is desktop manager. Most common way to crate a ""windows-like shortcut"" that I know of is ""\*.desktop"" files, which a basically a text file where you specify an app, starting folder, icon, etc - pretty much like on windows. But usually those work only from desktop/start menu, and not from any folder (yet again, this depends on a DM).",SteamDeck

A few notes however. What you call ""System links"" are actually called ""Symbolic links"". As for what you're refering to as ""memory positions"" on partitions, those would be actually be called ""inodes"" on a Filesystem. Partitions themselves have no understanding of files and directories, that is left up to the filesystem in use (ext4, btrfs, ect).",SteamDeck

I have been able to get the game up and running on the Steamdeck but it is not playable, I am running into an issue where in the 3D Overworld you cannot click on any interactable people or items and this is where my luck has seemed to end.   


To get it working I downloaded the game ISO the re-builder launcher. You can find this with a google. Extact the ISO to your game folder.  


In Discover search for and download Mount Unmount ISO, it is the top one that is described as being for Dolphin file systems. Mount the Lego Island ISO you had also extracted.  


In Lutris add game, search for Lego Island and select that, then select the Install.EXE file from the extracted ISO folder. With the ISO also mounted it should install and you can launch from Lutris, and add a shortcut to Steam.   

Edit: Forgot a very important step, after install is complete, go to the unpacked iso files and copy everything in the scripts folder, then go to the game folder the install created and paste all that into the script folder there, it will ask to overwrite one file, skip it. Now you can launch without the CD 


Now it is launchable in Game Mode. Change the scaling to any of the options besides Interger to get it to scale to fullscreen.   


Now it is playable up until I get to the actual 3D Overworld and am unable to itneract any further. But otherwise the game does run so I hope at some point I can get it fully working, if anyone else fixes the clickability issue please let me know.",SteamDeck

ji9vufo,"If you are asking whether you will be able to play while cooking/folding laundry/vacuuming/helping with homework - the answer is 'No'. If you are asking whether you will be able to sit comfortably on your gaming chair, in front of your desk - put the Steam Deck on a dock and play with a gamepad - still 'No'. 

Realistic Dad Steam Deck gaming scenarios:

- after doing all the chores from above, to crawl to the couch, use a pillow as a stand, and put the Steam Deck on top of it, and play ONLY once the kids are in bed, and your spouse has figured out what she'd occupy herself with rather than chat with you

- same as above, but substitute chores with long day at work

- same as above, but sub the couch with bed/toilet


The Steam Deck is great. Every dad needs one. But that need comes second to the necessity of a longer astronomical day to enjoy games during :)


*Edit* Just read your comment that you have one kid. Almost all my comments apply for scenarios with two or more kids. With one kid a dad barely scratches the surface of being busy. You should have plenty of time to enjoy the Steam Deck.",SteamDeck
ji7xpx7,"I am currently in the expecting stage with my wife but I specifically bought a steam deck in anticipation when we have a little one running around. The portability just like the Nintendo switch is more than likely what will be able to help me play from time to time. Kids will come first obviously, but being able to pick up. Play for maybe 30 minutes to an hour and go back to dad mode is alright with me",SteamDeck

ji9szdo,Decks awesome. Time for the kids to watch some tv. Sit with them and the deck. So good. I’ve put 80 hrs of Elden ring in cuddled in with my two girls on couch.  Best of both worlds.,SteamDeck
ji9vvyg,"Yes, it makes gaming a bit more convenient and less of a hassle. Especially when taking care of kids.",SteamDeck
ji9vyww,"For me, it's three things:

- it can pause instantly, so you're ready to deal with any calamity whenever you're needed
- it can resume instantly, so you don't need to waste your now-limited time with updates/booting/setup
- it doesn't disturb others, e.g. your sleeping kids or spouse watching TV

And if you work from home:

- it doesn't use your desktop, which you are probably sick of by the end of the workday",SteamDeck

jia3i0q,"Handheld gaming is the way. With the quick suspend options of the steamdeck, you can pick up where you left off instantly, if you've had to stop for some child related interruption.

I have a series X but literally never play it. But manage to get some gaming time in most days with the steam deck. You will find it fits in so much better with your lifestyle.",SteamDeck
jia42ai,I'm married with 3 kids. Gaming is harder to find time but still something I enjoy. Have a nice PC but grabbed a Deck a few months back. I absolutely love it. So much easier to get in a gaming session than on my PC. It blows my mind how well Valve did with this.  I'll chill on the couch with my wife while she watches a show I don't care for and I can game and still chat with her. I also love that I can dock it with the TV and play games with the family. Our favorite is to work together on Obra Dinn to solve everything together. Might be the best couch coop game I've ever played even though it's single player. Gets everyone talking and working together. I fly alot for work and it's great for that as well.,SteamDeck

jia8tnw,No special rules or differences for breeders. If you have a busy and active lifestyle this can let you play video games in that down time. Battery life isn't that great but again you aren't no lifing it so an hour here and there is worth it if you are trying to keep up with video games. If you are like me though and just exhausted when that time does come I pass out much easier playing the deck than to be sitting at a desk. Playing on the couch or in bed? Lights out lol almost too convenient,SteamDeck
jia9k0x,"I love my Steam Deck, but I still find time to play it difficult with a 6 month old. Best time is nap time and bedtime but even then there's jobs to do and of course sleep to get!!

My wife is having a rough pregnancy so it's already come in useful for the times I'm sat up with her when she's unable to sleep 😂 seeing other parents comments in how much of a game changer having the SD is while trying to juggle parenthood pretty much helped make the decision for me.

Also I may lose my ""office"" to my son after he's born 😂",SteamDeck
jiakfw0,"Dad of 3 who got a steam deck a couple weeks ago. I absolutely love it and it's allowed me to get so much more game time in. I can be around the kids and play and quickly attend to them if something comes up. We also co-sleep with our kids so before trying to game meant hoping they didn't wake up now that dad is no longer present to snuggle. Now I can get toddler cuddles while playing on my deck in the bed.

Highly recommend the steam deck for any gaming parents.",SteamDeck

ji9nnha,I use this feature on the switch constantly. Just earlier I was in the middle of a hunt on monster hunter when my son dropped a tray of an entire cut water melon on the floor (he’s 2) and it was so convenient to just hit the power button and pick up a half hour later. Hoping the deck feature is similar.,SteamDeck

So when my wife falls asleep on me, I turn the ps5 on. However I couldn’t count the amount of times she has done this and the controller is out of reach! I just end up sat there watching something on tv or my phone as I don’t want to wake her (I know how precious sleep is!).

jiartky,"Better screen is number one - the Deck’s screen today is by far the worst thing about it. I’d be happy with another 12800x800 screen, as it’s fine for the size and viewing distance of the Deck, but I’d LOVE to see an OLED upgrade (honestly, even a decent IPS panel would be a major improvement). >60hz would be nice, but obviously would mainly impact older & indie games. 

Second thing I’d like would be a quieter fan.

Some kind of performance improvement would be nice, but honestly I don’t see performance as being more important than the above (for me at least. Maybe I’m weird).",SteamDeck

- maybe (just maybe) - a second SD card slot
- ever so slightly larger front buttons

I don't really care about the bezels, they don't annoy me at all. Not sure why people care about this one so much. Also, the screen quality, while not perfect, is good enough for a handheld.",SteamDeck
jib4jss,"1.) Snap out section on back bezel with one screw for m.2 replacement (no full tear down)

2.) More VRAM needs to be available (at least 12/16)
2.) 16:9 OLED screen (720 is fine for handheld)

3.) Better Wi-Fi chip 

4.) Performance bump, 720 with medium settings at 30-40fps stable would be nice in most games

Other nice things would be:

Easier way to install third party stores without heroic/lutris, baseline model needs to have enough storage to make a decent swap file.

Lower audio latency. Sadly even if not using bluetooth, I can feel the audio lag when watching videos. 

The menu button is too close to the X Y buttons. I accidentally hit it when playing Street Fighter V

jiaqkqd,"A 12V 120Ah battery has a capacity of ~1440Wh assuming you don't want to wear out your batteries too much, we'll say 60Ah for 50%.  

If both batteries are in parallel, that gives us 120Ah of capacity.  With this information, assuming the deck is drawing the absolute maximum possible, and not accounting for any losses based on conversion (12v to 15v for a car PD charger, lots of weirdness for an AC inverter into the official charger) that would give you just in the ballpark of 32 hours of charge time before your batteries hit half capacity.  

If you're constantly charging with a charge controller on a sunny day, assuming you're getting maybe 80% of the rated wattage of the panels, the deck being charged from dead and being used at the same time will consume about 10% of your generated power coming in.  

So I'd say charging your deck for a few hours a day would be a pretty negligible hit to your battery life, all things considered.  If it's fully charged, the deck itself only uses about 25-28W from the wall in operation at full tilt, so you can reduce these numbers by 60% at full battery.  

Another option you'd have to help mitigate power loss in your primary battery bank is to get something like the 65w baseus charger and a small phone charging panel, stick it on the dash during the day to have a reserve for the steam deck in the evening.  I've got a foldable that'll charge the baseus 65w brick to full over the course of a day without issue in full sun.",SteamDeck

jiamkqg,">how many amp hours the Steamdeck uses while charging

I think you're mixing your units up. Amp Hours is a unit of storage, but you're asking for power draw. It comes with a 5.3 Amp Hour battery, so charging it from zero to full will use roughly that.

If you're playing while charging the battery, it will get pretty close to the 45W that the charger provides. If the battery is charged and you're playing while plugged in the screen + APU should use around 30W.

With the 45W charger, the Steam Deck will operate at 3v/15A and the amp draw will fluctuate is it requires more power.

>I just want a general idea of whether the deck will drain my batteries too much while charging

It'll probably have a similar power draw to a small 12v RV refrigerator considering you have to provide it AC and you'll get some losses at the inverter, and taking into account that the fridge, like the Steam Deck, can draw more or less power depending what it's doing.",SteamDeck
jibew1t,"It’s worth it for the screen alone. The specs look amazing and the quiet fan sounds awesome too.

It’ll be interesting to see if the ease of use for the average person is better on the Ally or the Steam Deck. It’ll have way better game compatibility because Windows but it also won’t be running an OS designed for a handheld form factor.

SteamOS’s strength is gaming mode which is easy for anyone to grok right out of the box and uses controller navigation. The software on the Ally is Windows 11 I think with their Armory Crate software on top of it.

It’s not a perfect comparison but it’s kind of like Apple making the software and hardware for a product vs Android where a manufacturer makes the hardware and uses a skin over stock Android OS. The optimizations that come with making the software specifically for that hardware are hard to quantify but usually come with a better user experience. Hard to tell before anyone actually uses the thing though.

If they nail the software experience, it’s an amazing option. If they don’t, it’s still amazing tech but you’d be trading the headaches of Linux game compatibility with the headaches of Windows on a handheld.",SteamDeck

Interesting highlights from the article:

\- started slow, but by 3 PM, the trial space got a lot more visitors and you had to wait a little to get in there

\- One of the store clerks from Edion told me that this is a **test market**. They are not sure yet if the Steam Deck will be sold nationally in Edion, and for now they want to see how the sales are picking up before making a decision.

\- All test units were 512 gb models. When you asked to compare the screens, they had to show a youtube video cause there were no other test units.

\- 15 to 20 titles could be tested, mostly Japanese games.

\- Komodo employee said sales were “amazing” and buyers were: ""mostly PC gamers but they are starting to see also more and more people who were not PC gamers in the first place picking it up""

\- A TV crew was going around to cover the event

\- Store said they have 'several hundreds' of units in the store.

\- Not many cards left after the first day, so almost all the stock was sold (to buy one, you pick up a card and hand it to the store clerk)

\- 512 gb model is the most popular

\- Price is the same as online

\- Writers has concerns about whether there is enough explanations of what Steam is (there are posters and pamphlets, but not a lot of people to give explanations). Although apparently he could ask questions to a Komodo employee before? Some games also had issues with crashing or launching offline. Room for improvement, but overall impression was positive.

jibb36i,"It can, but the Retroarch core is by far the worst way to do it, and I used to use it for the same reasons you do. I appreciate shaders too, but the experience of using PCSX2 QT with the Lottes CRT shader is the best. The QT version has a much improved interface that functions with a controller, allows for per-game settings, easy renderer toggling from the pause menu and has a TON of fixes that the core doesn't as it's still an alpha build. It also has better latency if you tweak the settings for it. The main appeal of Retroarch is run-ahead for reducing latency which doesn't apply here.

For running it docked, I set the resolution to 1920x1080 so it scales well on a 4k TV, which also keeps the Deck UI snappy and responsive.

PCSX2 QT also supports RetroAchievements if that's of interest to you.

I've played through most of Vice City at 2x rendering, NFS Underground 2, Fatal Frame using the software renderer, and a few others.",SteamDeck
jibd7r6,"Is it possible to change the properties of the shader (lottes)?

I realize the core in retroarch is way behind, but if I can play on decent res with decent shaders at 30/60 fps I'm good. I'll mainly be playing JRPGs. 

Anyway I didn't realize lottes was available, that's pretty good. I guess it's not possible to add other shaders?

Thank you for the reply and info, appreciate it.",SteamDeck
jibgfpn,"I believe the built-in shaders are scanlines, triangle and diagonal shaders (going from memory), Lottes, and possibly one more. I do feel like I'd like to darken the scanlines a bit but I haven't been able to find the relevant file to do so, although Google has led me to believe it's an .ini file somewhere and is possible. I've checked the usual locations on the Deck for config files for both flatpak and appimages but I installed PCSX2 QT via EmuDeck and can't find where it is. It should be as simple as using a text editor to change it though.

I've been meaning to ask on the discord about that but haven't gotten around to it yet.

The core is acceptable for some games, for sure, but sometimes it's not and that's why I bailed on it. I tried Magna Carta via the core and the latency for the button combos was atrocious, but using QT, adjusting the audio and emulation latency to the lowest was far, far better. However, many JRPGs don't require great timing and those ones would likely be fine. I played through Red Faction and Dragon Quest 8 in RetroArch so it definitely isn't bad.

That said, the nice thing about the Deck is if you use Steam ROM Manager on the Deck you can use the parsers to create Game Mode shortcuts, so you're not restricted to using only one emulator. You can set some to use RetroArch, some as PCSX2 standalone, etc. It does require a bit of tinkering to enter the right info in the shortcuts but after that it's painless to just launch and play.

Right now, using a plugin for Decky Loader on the Deck is necessary for hitting 60fps for some titles, even using the vulkan renderer. Valkyrie Profile 2 is one of those, where it needs the cores bumped down to 3 or 4 for higher performance. Come May when a kernel update happens and we have a new video driver, this might no longer be necessary as that bug is supposed to be fixed.

In the end, most PS2 titles are fully playable with some tweaks. Some can be rendered at native, 2x and 3x without issue with the vulkan renderer, some can only use the software renderer, and some have a few other bugs that need settings changes, but I think the list of unplayable games that people care about is very low.

Even things like the Metal Gear Solid games allow for binding a pressure modified button (in QT at least) so that you can get past sections that need it.

You don't need to ditch the core, I just like sharing the info on why I did after I heavily used it instead of the standalone versions. Better to be aware of an alternative in case you ever want to try it.

To answer your question, the Deck is a fantastic choice for everything up to PS2 and GameCube if you familiarize yourself with how to tweak things when needed. It's my primary emulation device, and I even use it docked a ton despite having a PS2 and RetroTink 5x in my livingroom. It's just convenient.",SteamDeck

jibiqwi,"It really depends on who you are and what you want out of it.

For me I bought the Steam Deck hoping for it to be a full-blown cyberdeck, and in that regard the lack of physical keyboard is a giant negative--yes, the on-screen keyboard works in the pinch, and some people are able to be really precise with the dual-touchpad typing. But the bigger issue is that the keyboard takes up half the screen, and the Deck really doesn't have those pixels to spare.

In a similar vein, 1280x800 is perfect for handheld gaming, but I've come across a decent number of Linux applications cut off critical UI elements on anything less than 1080p (Avidemux, I'm looking at you).

Other people will say that the Steam Deck is underpowered, or its battery life too little, or that it's too big or its screen low quality, or that going with a 2230 SSD seriously limits upgradability options.

But frankly, taken on the whole, as an **omni-console** capable of playing pretty much any game ever made, and needing to balance power, efficiency, ergonomics, cooling, packaging and price, the Steam Deck is still the best device on the market, bar none.",SteamDeck
jibh4xz,"You need to know some amount of Linux to resolve issues and get decent performance for resource intensive games. Proton GE is a must and you need to install it yourself.

jibh589,It's more or less dealing with AAA games and running them at reasonable quality levels *for now* but it's only a matter of time before it runs out of steam on that front.,SteamDeck
jibiwwl,"Honestly it depends on your use case, like if you want it specifically for gaming and nothing else then the cons will include battery life while playing AAA titles, I get like maybe 1 hour and 45 min playing cyberpunk.

Also the screen kinda sucks, it's an edgelit LCD whose saturation is kinda low by default.  Getting the vibrant deck plug in and turning the saturation up a big helps a lot, but it's still not great.


If you want to play ALL PC games you'll be disappointed, MOST will run fine, but some due to anticheat or dev laziness won't work like battlefield 2042, the newest cod, Fortnite, and tarkov for example.


If you plan to use it as a Linux PC it's honestly fantastic, though there are a few annoyances I have personally.


It would be nice to have SOME kind of built in keyboard be it slide out or what ever.  


Valve really need to work on its steam input library for Wayland environments, when booting a vanilla Linux os and loading into a Wayland session for kde at least the trackpad as expected until you launch steam then the cursory becomes invisible, it's still there and interacts with the apps and desktop... But you can't actually see where the mouse is.... Kinda a problem!  So I really wish they'd fix that it's been a problem since the steam controller and there's been an open issue on their GitHub for it since then.


I do wish the usb-c port was USB 4 which would allow us to hack together a solution for egpu docks that doesn't require installing an os in an external SSD and using the m.2 slot as a pcie slot to plug a GPU into it.


The controller is comfortable but I wish the sticks were a bit better, the guilikit sticks fix that but I do wish they were better out of the box.",SteamDeck
jibl54h,"It's ***BIG.*** Seriously, pictures can not prepare you for how bulky this thing is. It makes the Switch feel small.

Because of its size, it's not something you're gonna have with you all the time ready to go. It doesn't fulfill the dream of playing AAA games at any moment on a whim. Instead, it's something you're probably only gonna bring along when you *know* you're going to have some time to play a game.

That's really the main downside though. I'm still just as enamoured with the device as I was when I first got it, and it does a fantastic job of living up to the slogan of ""your games are going places."" It's hard to come up with anything truly bad to say about it for what it is.",SteamDeck
jibnfxe,"In my opinion the biggest downsides are the battery life, performance, and game compatibility. Most games work fine, but some won't, which is mostly because those games use an incompatible anticheat system (ProtonDB and areweanticheatyet will be your friends here). Performance-wise some games just obviously will never work on the Deck because they require too much horsepower, but some other games you may be tempted to try will be just on the limit of playability, which can be frustrating. And even then, those more demanding games will chew through a full battery in about two hours at most.

Some people will say that the screen has poor colors. I think this is mostly because graphics drivers on Windows tend to oversaturate colors by default, because of which many people have gotten used to that oversaturation. If you're used to more accurate color reproduction then it won't be as much off an issue for you, but the screen is still not the best. It's certainly no OLED screen, that's for sure.",SteamDeck

this is well and good if you understand that and temper your expectations, but i have seen people tap out and complain about steam decks because they thought they were getting something like an upgraded switch, where they'd be able to just magically play every PC game ever at 30/60 FPS. it obviously doesn't work that way.

If you delete anything for SDDM that isn't like a log file, you will probably be very unhappy. I can't remember exactly what the term for it is, but SDDM is a program that basically logs you into the system and starts the GUI.

I would recreate the log file if I were you though, just make an empty version of it. Some programs (idk of sddm is one of these programs), will throw errors if that file is missing. Most programs will just recreate it or skip the logging step if the file isn't there, but better safe then sorry, so just create a file with the same name and leave it.",SteamDeck

jia7pyp,"Wine: Wine Is Not an Emulator ; )  but it's a compatibility layer. It's a seemingly small distinction with far-ranging ramifications.

My approach would be running the Windows version, and only if that doesn't play nice with Wine/Proton proceed to the Linux native version. The Windows versions usually just run better (in terms of framerates and/or stability).

I haven't tried the trackpad yet with regards to mouse controls --- not because of apprehension, but simply because of a huge backlog that suited the Steam Deck anyway. I'm now several games further into that 300+ out of 600+ games backlog and a few of the next ones are Horizon Zero Dawn and Divinity: Original Sin 2. I've read and watched a number of reviews and they all rave about the trackpads on the Deck, so I guess that is indeed a large advantage over the Ally. They seem to be pretty great (after some getting used to them, I think).

And yes, desktop mode is a full Linux experience, so you can use the Deck for any task you could use a (Linux) desktop for. I run Nobara as my main desktop (98 percent usage; dual-boot Windows is only for the occasional Fortnite session with friend and family) and it is well-suited for any kind of 'real' hard work. ; ) I would strongly recommend getting a dock, though --- coding on the virtual keyboard isn't going to be fun.

Mostly mouse-centric, and all of the commands are clickable. No real changes needed other than to change the controller profile. There are some Quality-of-Life improvements to be had by using the joysticks to move around the map and the buttons for common shortcuts.

ji91rw7,I purchased a pack of grips of amazon. They are hex grid rubber but very soft and add about 3-4mm of material so not to chunky but just enough. Also comes with pads for bumpers and triggers.

Also from your post it is not very clear during which of your steps the enclosure is involved and when it is not.

USB to NVMe enclosures use either JMicron JMS583 or Realtek 9210B chipset. I'd say it is just an indication that yours is a JMicron one, and no NVMe drive was recognized.

> Maybe it's a bum drive?

ji24g9y,"People have a lot of problems on PC as you can read on steam game’s page, some people complain issue on ps5 version. I think steam deck can’t run it for months…all we can do is waiting for performance improvements!",SteamDeck
ji357df,"So fucking bad…

Can’t get past the open walking scene, doesn’t just crash the game, I have to hard shutdown my deck and boot it back up.

The menu alone runs at 20FPS if I’m lucky before I even select start journey with all the graphics settings on low or off.

So disappointed. I was so hyped for this game.",SteamDeck
ji265xo,"its bad everywhere, pc, ps5 and of course on deck",SteamDeck
ji283gw,"Somebody set it to lowest settings and even with FSR it struggled to go above 20 FPS, dipping into the 15s every so often.",SteamDeck
ji2n78b,I want it to work so bad :(,SteamDeck

ji2akl1,What about after its day-one patch?,SteamDeck
ji2vsqf,"I'm about 2.5 hours in. Coruscant was about 24 fps dropping into 17s every so often. But once I got to koboh, it's been in the low 30s occasionally to 22 or so fps. I am running with all settings at low, fsr set to quality. Although it doesn't seem to matter other than performance looks like ass. And, I am also running it in preview mode. No crashes so far. My biggest beef is at meditation points when the scale of the UI is screwed.",SteamDeck

ji2oqtm,"Only the first planet is bad for me. Lowest settings 20fps or lower. 

On the second planet I get 30-40fps on medium. 

To me this is playable. But I’m also 48 and remember when 30fps was the pinnacle of gaming. So your mileage may vary. 

But I have a pc with 3070, i7, and 32g ram and I prefer my steam deck over it, even though it obviously performs way better. 

To me this game is very playable but I can understand how to others this would be considered completely broken. 

Anyway good luck folks",SteamDeck
ji2zm77,"Lowest settings, v-sync off, in-game fsr off gets you 15-20 fps on the first planet.

I have it capped at 30 fps and it's been fairly consistent on the second planet with several stutters in-between. Haven't got any further yet.

The fan is still reving quite a bit and the game crashes after a few hours.

Definitely not playable but it is working.",SteamDeck

ji3dlop,"It’s important to remember that this community has vastly different opinions on what is good when it comes to a game running on Deck. Many here are overly obsessed with frame rates and resolution. Those of us that came up gaming in the Morrowind for Xbox era have a widely varying opinion of good quality. Some of us are more than accepting of minimal staggering, running at 30FPS (since there’s really no visual difference), and waiting for new areas to load (we waited 3-5 minutes in Morrowind after all)",SteamDeck
ji2slis,Buy it on PS5 and then Stream it via Chiaki4deck. That's what I'm doing.,SteamDeck
ji2spc9,"I don't have Survivor yet (and based on these reviews they've got a lot of work to do before I consider it), but I really recommend trying Fallen Order on the Deck if you have it. It does not run well, reams your battery life, and the vent at the top of the deck hits takeoff speed in about 30 seconds of play. It runs on the EA client, which simply does not work correctly on the deck-- you can get through it, but it's a pain in the ass. On top of that, it uses EA's cloud saves, rather than Steam's, which, you guessed it, doesn't work reliably.

I started a replay of Fallen Order, hoping to play it on PC when I could and Deck when I couldn't. I abandoned it. The juice was not worth the squeeze, especially when it stutters like a bitch in both modes. I really like the gameplay, but the performance and roadblocks to getting into Fallen Order are just unacceptable to me.

And then Survivor is apparently much, much worse than Fallen Order ever was in terms of performance across all systems? I would not expect to have a great experience on Deck, but it's probably functional if you really want to invest the effort.",SteamDeck

Intel GPUs essentially got a large performance boost in older games because they integrated some parts of proton into their drivers. If it was a windows specific bottleneck, for example, it wouldn't have the issue.

Also, Nvidia GPUs dominate the PC market, but the deck is on AMD. Something that favors AMDs' architecture could show up as better deck performance in general.

I'd rather it look like smooth hot garbage than gorgeous but a juttery/stuttery mess.  

With that said, ray tracing can be extremely impactful (Control, CP2077, Minecraft, Metro Exodus enhanced) but it can also be utterly pointless (Hogwarts legacy, Battlefield). It really all depends on the game but control especially really was a hugely improved game on my RT playthrough just due to all the glass and polished stone and how it plays into the atmosphere of the game.

jiancz9,"> Let me explain the problem. I assume lots of us who has to travel have to charge decky not on a nice neat desk at home, but at every opportunity we have: nightstands, chairs, floor, you name it. The only criteria - there is a socket nearby.

I've had zero problems taking it out and charging on the nightstand next to the bed in the hotel.

Nope. I doubt they want to take on the liability if it overheats while charging.

>Not ideal, but has anyone tried to DIY a hole in case against the charging port? Did it work?

See u/Nearby-Tumbleweed-88's comment. It totally works, but you assume the risk.

ji771ks,"Basically, a shader is some graphics math your device has to do. The math is slightly different on different devices. Consoles are all the same, so they can do the math beforehand and let you download the solution directly, which you then load whenever you need it. PCs can't do that because they are all different. That can cause games to stutter because you have to wait a brief moment for them to do the math.

Because Decks are all the same, Valve does the math for you and lets you download the results, just like on consoles. However, these are always saved to your SSD so they can be loaded very quickly. That's the whole point, to go much faster than calculating from scratch. Which means your SSD can fill up quickly even if you download games to your SD card. And there's no easy way to delete shaders you don't need anymore. They aren't telling you how big the shaders will be for a game either.

Transcoded videos are in there too. Some videos cannot be played because you need Windows for them, so they are converted into a different format they can play. That's saved with your shaders and it can take up a lot of space.",SteamDeck
ji6voaz,"your game will use shaders, regardless. That's just how graphics work. The pre-cached ""shaders"" also include transcoded video files and cut-scenes, which your Linux machine can't do on the fly.

Steam uses and installs pre-cached shaders to save CPU cycles, and thus reduces stuttering and freezes. Why wouldn't people want this? I definitely would rather download these shaders in advance, to get better performance, than have the stutters.",SteamDeck
ji6ubzt,"there is no real problem
ppl just would like to know how much more the shaders will take space before installing a game

they only exist to reduce fps drops",SteamDeck
ji7f35g,"The problem is that for performance reasons Steam doesn't store the shader cache on the SD card and for some games it's taking a lot of space. Also it's downloading and keeping the shader cache of all the games you have installed. But the ultimate reason it's doing that is because without shader cache the experience of gaming on the Steam Deck can be very bad.

However in a future update, that I think might be coming with SteamOS 3.5, the problem of very bad experience without shader cache will be definitely fixed by something called graphic pipeline library in the GPU drivers. There will be also a massive reduction of shader caches size. At this point it might also become possible to only download shader caches for games you are actually playing as it will not be too bad if you are offline and can't get it.

There is also the issue of unsupported codecs that requires patents, for videos encoded with those in games Steam transcode the video in their server and send it along the shader cache. Steam could send those on the SD card if they separated it from the shader cache.",SteamDeck

I think it is more reasonable to dial down graphics settings so as to get a sweet spot between acceptable visuals, power consumption and optimal performance.
For me, a good total power consumption is 7-10Watts even for AAA games.
That way, you can run at 4-8Watt limit on CPU and 400-1000MHz on GPU, while not maxing out the CPU and GPU %usage to no more than 70% especially on the GPU.
Even if the device can run a game at Ultra but it's consuming a total of 18Watts, I will dial down the settings so that it runs at no more than 10Watts.

We all need to remember that it's a portable device and we should be grateful that it can even run AAA games.
Putting so much strain on it will only make components prone to damage and also degrade the battery faster.

3. Copy the code in the text file into a visual studio code project. There are better ways to compile but this is by far the easiest in my opinion and experience. Just download Visual studio code from discover, open it up, then click the plus/new tab button to open a new window. Copy the text into this window, download the extensions that pop up if you want. I already had them installed, not sure if this is necessary however. 

4. Click the run/play button, it'll run and generate the file needed in the same directory as the text file. It might show an error/issue but this doesn't matter. Close VS. If a file has appeared in the same directory as the text file, you're Gucci. 

5. Open a terminal window in the same directory as the text file and the compiled file. You can do this via right click, then open konsole. 

6. Type in sudo ./SD_Unlocker 

7. Enter your password

8. If no error pops up, it worked. Turn off steamdeck and boot into bios. You should see 2 new options. 

9. Watch cryos tutorial on overclocking and be careful!

Overclocking does help slightly if you're really limited, especially CPU wise. Helps a lot for switch emulation in my experience, especially with a ram overclock too. 

TDP changes aren't worth it in my experience, the added heat and battery drain aren't worth it. However I have noticed it making games much smoother if the CPU and GPU, or just the CPU are maxed. GPU wise it's not gonna do anything. The extra power helps prevent the GPU from choking the CPU and keeps it running smoothly.

I disabled power throttling and watched Tetris Effect Connected throw 13W through the GPU and 4.5W through the CPU and temps got to 87C rather fast.

This was on the main menu with max particles, etc.  FPS was about 43.

Set that back down to 100% and temps dropped drastically.

When power throttling was at default (with the render scale and other settings maxed out), FPS was 40, and temps stopped at 81C, and GPU was about 9.4W (forgot what the CPU was).

I'm guessing then that it's the ""TDP"" setting that also isn't doing anything, since total TDP was exceeding 15W with Package Power Limiter set to disabled.

This will remove the power limit and allow >15W power draw. 

Your steam deck will probably get super warm, so a custom fan curve is recommended.

 You won't really get more performance unfortunately, as 15W is the limit for a reason. See the graph  - https://i.imgur.com/7RAzBlp.png",SteamDeck
ji8exmu,"Wait, you made Glossi?! Awesome work man holy shit! Such a great tool, actually made windows on deck worthwhile!",SteamDeck
ji75tso,"Yeah, the bigger thing here in my opinion is just the undervolting. I got everything -50 with a GPU limit boost  to 2000. It usually hovers around 1750 in RE4 remake with those settings in the demanding sections. 

So if you turn off power throttling it bypassed the tdp limit? Am I understanding that correctly? 

I might give that a try just out of curiosity, but it really seems like the single biggest performance boost we can get is the RAM OC. I won't touch the ram though as it seems rather inconsistent among users (and I got the Samsung memory), I'm satisfied enough with the deck that I don't want to risk it. My main rig is already OC'd to the gills, that's enough for me.",SteamDeck
ji8m507,How did you disable power throttling? What option is it? There's a few with similar names :),SteamDeck
ji6cdjj,"TDP changes aren't gonna make a huge difference. There's a reason valve capped it at 15w, it's the point of hugely diminishing returns. The gpu really doesn't need more power. 

HOWEVER, if your game is CPU bound or struggling to power both the GPU and CPU it can help it run smoother. Sometimes the GPU can choke the CPU of power, this can really help out with that. 

Don't expect 20% more performance for 20% more power however. 

The deck will just turn off if it tries to draw more power than the vrms allow. 18w is the sweet spot imo.",SteamDeck

ji7a77b,"Yes, it was drawing 18W combined.  I also saw Elden Ring (max detail, no RT) pulling up to 11W from the GPU which it never did before.  (usually it would go up to 10.4 max).  Maybe gave me 1 FPS increase.

Undervolting is definitely the way to go then.  TDP increase feels like going from 400W to 525W on a shunt modded RTX 3090 FE and gaining a whopping 6% FPS boost for way more heat :/

How are people actually managing to exceed 15W from either the GPU or CPU outside of benchmark programs though?",SteamDeck
ji8o6cf,"I think it's under SMU Debug Options.

Close to the top it should say ""Power Limiting support"" or something.

The SOC (CPU & GPU) will only draw up to 15W by default, you can remove this limit to allow the SOC to draw more power. It will generate a ton more heat for a little more performance overhead. 

It will obviously make your battery run out faster, and charging SLOWER while using! Don't do this if you're worried about battery life or charging speed.",SteamDeck

More about maintaining clocks I would say vs actually gaining a lot of extra performance. 

Of course it also depends on the game. Some are really hungry and will easily use all that power.",SteamDeck

For a game like Ghost Runner, where aiming isn't a priority, I don't use trigger dampening. You'll have to spend time yourself kinda messing around with all of it, but it's pretty awesome when you get to a comfortable place. As a side note... games like Halo Infinite and CoD are just built around analog stick, so might want to consider both options.",SteamDeck
ji8ecwh,"I typically use a gyro + trackpad setup with trackpad touch deactivating gyro. I use most of the default settings for trackpad except with less smoothing and a sensitivity that may turn the camera 90-180 degrees from half a sweep. I've also been using action layers for weapon switching. My gyro settings is close to the default except with no smoothing and the sensitivity right now is about 7:1 (when I rotate the deck 45 degrees in real life, it rotates the camera 315 degrees in-game).",SteamDeck
ji8p0vn,"It's set to use the PC. Not going to play an fps on controller, I just can't stand it.",SteamDeck
ji7kugj,"I recommend beginners to use Medium acceleration, and also lower the smoothing a bit. Though other than that, if you want to really enjoy and kick ass in a game like Doom Eternal, there's no way around getting used to gyro.",SteamDeck
ji7lxgr,"My favorite recommendation is that one full swipe from the left to the right should turn you around 180 degree. That makes for a nice reference point to adjust sensitivity. This can be a bit fast for finer aiming movements, which is why i have Gyro ""always on"", but it only allows for small corrections of the aiming. This means Gyro never gets in the way, but I can also make fine adjustments even when not having a finger on the trackpad or one of the buttons.

Besides that, I usually have one of the lower back buttons set to activate an action layer that transforms the right trackpad to a radial menu with ""continuous"" activation, for a weapon wheel when the game has several weapons. In a game like Doom 2016, for example, I will know that the shotgun selection is roughly at ""1 o'clock"" on the weapon wheel, so I put my finger on that spot, quickly tap the action layer button and instantly switch to that weapon. When I'm unsure about the weapon selection I can still hold the action layer button and scroll through the radial menu as usual. This works so well, I much preferred it to the weapon wheel actually built into that game. The Doom 2016 weapon wheel slows down time while you use it, but since the Steam Input method is much faster, or in this case instantaneous, it's still an advantage!

Additionally, I like having trackball mode ""on"" with friction set to ""high"". I don't really use the trackball function, but I still prefer it that way instead of stopping completely when I let go of the trackpad. Also, haptics are off almost on the entire setup, except for trigger buttons, trackpad clicks and maybe the radial menu.",SteamDeck

this one. it's easy to set up, you just need to toggle right trackpad as mouse and then adjust the slider that appears under it, two swipes and you should be aiming at the same spot before turning.

You think someone who stole someething they have to register and give fingerprints for if they sell it at a magic pawnshop would bring it to a pawn shop instead of selling it on Facebook with no information, none of the hassle, and for more money? Is this 1983?

The FedEx store was connected to this big business building its fkin huge so we went there and talked to the lobby security hoping maybe it got dumped there but no, we gave them our information and went home talked to steam again and told them we might ask for a refund if we don't find it tomorrow at the building.

Probably a few hrs b4 we went to look again, I got a call from a woman who works at the building telling me they found our package, she said it was at the 6th floor and NO ONE goes there but this one electrician and he happened to find it and brought it to lobby.

I ofc thanked her profusely and we picked it up...I have 0 idea how fkin FedEx decided to put a package meant to be sent to their store get put on the 6th floor instead of like the lobby if they were fkin lost.

Moral of the story, FedEx fkin sucks, FedEx uses drivers who are not in their system so u cannot find them or report them they have no humans to even contact and they don't do shit.

I could be wrong, but I personally would contact them to see if this falls under their jurisdiction. I would start with the shipping carrier and if they give no information or help I'd go to the FTC. Here's a brief summary from their site that I feel like relates to this theft:

&#x200B;

""The basic statute enforced by the FTC, Section 5(a) of the [FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act),  **empowers the agency to investigate and prevent unfair methods of  competition, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting  commerce**. This creates the Agency’s two primary missions: protecting  competition and protecting consumers. **The statute gives the FTC  authority to seek relief for consumers, including injunctions and  restitution, and in some instances to seek civil penalties from  wrongdoers.** The FTC has the ability to implement trade regulation rules  defining with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive  and the Commission can publish reports and make legislative  recommendations to Congress about issues affecting the economy. The  Commission enforces various antitrust laws under Section 5(a) of the FTC  Act as well as the [Clayton Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/clayton-act). The FTC [monitors all its orders](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/media-resources/enforcing-orders.pdf) to ensure compliance.""

OP, if you or your neighbors have doorbell cams, I’d recommend seeing if you can collect those videos and get them to law enforcement. I bet they’d love to have those but lack the resources to follow up to that degree. If they recognize the person, they may be able to rope them up. 

Either way, reporting this, to me, is a good idea (barring discrimination or something). It establishes a history of theft in your area, which they could then circle back to if they catch this person doing something else. They can also use the report to prioritize their future efforts. And you can use the police report if for some reason insurance or something becomes involved.",SteamDeck

And they're only advertised in local networks anyway, nothing on the internet knows the MAC address of your network card, unless the program you're using manually collects and sends it to a server (Steam could, but it doesn't preclude the first two issues).

The original purpose of MAC addresses is to allow devices to communicate with other devices on the same local network that don't have an IP address yet (so that routers can assign them IP addresses via DHCP).

The Deck's bootloader/BIOS has no similar restrictions.  It'll boot anything, as evidenced by how many people use Clonezilla as part of SSD upgrades.

The only thing Valve can do is blacklist the serial number from Steam itself, which does severely limit the usefulness/value of the device for 99%+ of people.  Or they may do something sneakier like letting you log in, and providing the cops with your IP address so they can get a warrant from your ISP.

Also for phones, you can blacklist the IMEI which results in:

1)  The towers rejecting the device

And if game resolution is important to people, you can still set games at 1080p on SD if you wanted.

One rogueish game that plays great on deck and is maybe a bit obscure but fun is [Delver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/249630/Delver/), It can be a bit mean sometimes but that is part of the fun in rogue games ?..

Pretty much all of these games can be nabbed cheaply during steam sales I guess, I think that almost every game that I own on steam is purely because I have a giant wishlist that notifys me every time anything that I am interested in getting is on sale hehe, constant emails from steam every day or 2 letting me know :)",SteamDeck

I’m not a huge RPG guy but grew up on PR so I’m having a great time lol. Relatively short game too. I’m closing in on the ending I think and I’m at 8.5 hours.

#2) Mr. Sun's Hatbox
#3) DIG - Deep In Galaxies


All criminally underrated games. 

Lunacid is a fromsoft/kingsfield inspired first person dungeon crawler, it has a really cool mechanic where the real life lunar cycle affects gameplay.

Mr. Sun's Hatbox is a cool roguelite/settlement manager/action sidescroller. I don't even know where to begin describing gameplay, just google it. Comes with some real pretty pixel graphics too. For me it's even more addictive than Vampire Survivors.

Deep In Galaxies is a fun galaxy/planet exploration roguelite. It has very simple but satisfying combat, some cool mechanics like being able to destroy terrain, and a *load* of weapons and items.",SteamDeck
ji5fil7,"Not quite sure how applicable this one would be, as it's an emulated GameCube title that's not too very unpopular, but Chibi Robo. Dude.
 I remember this game being very fun when I played it as a kid, and that I ended up becoming so attached to the silly characters and situations in the game that it brought me to tears at a couple points.
 And recently while playing through it again emulated on my Steam Deck, I've been able to feel a lot of those same vibes again. I've been dealing with a lot of losses recently in my life, and there are many themes in Chibi Robo that hit pretty hard for a game about being a cute five inch tall housekeeping robot. Plus the music slaps and it's a good game to put on to relax and decompress.

TL;DR I've been sad and emulating Chibi Robo for GCN has been a fun way of helping me relive some simplicity from my childhood. Would fully recommend it if you like chill cute games.",SteamDeck

It's a rogue-like dungeon crawler game with a crafting system through gathering materials, and you can play as many different characters that all have advantages and disadvantages compared to one another. It can be pretty difficult, but I find it to be really fun.

The game is available on other systems like Switch and mobile devices (and the non-DX version which was released first is also on iOS and 3DS), and even though I had the game on Switch already, I decided to test the game out on the Steam Deck, and it works perfectly with basically no issues, even with the game's unknown compatibility status on the Deck.

Also want to shout out Elex, which I think is a massively underrated game that runs really nicely on the Deck and is cheap on sale pretty often.

* **Hot Brass**, similar to Police Stories, but not retro. Just works despite ""unsupported"" status.
* **Escape from Rosecliff Island**, a hidden object game, which I love to play in bed.
* **God's Trigger**, a bit like Hotline Miami, but also very different :-)
* **Guns, Gore & Cannoli**, 2d platformer shooter with Mafia, zombies and Nazis, what else could you wish for.
* **Hong Kong Massacre**, basically Hotline Miami in Hong Kong without retro style.
* **The Messenger**, retro pixel 2d platformer (probably well known).
* **Sky Force**, vertical scroller
* **Victor Vran**, an ARPG that deserved mored attention IMO.
* **Windward**, a pirates clone, I would say.

Generally, without opening up the topic of emulation, I also like the retro collections on Steam, like Contra, Castlevania, Mega Man etc.

Also Duke Nukem 1, 2, Manhattan Project and Commander Keen works well.

ji93lm1,"Intergalactic Fishing.

It's a top-down indie sandbox fishing game set in a world where you can instantly teleport to other planets to fish. Early in the game's storyline you get the ability to randomly jump to procedurally generated lakes with procedurally generated fish. It becomes a mixture of fishing, No Man's Sky, and almost a puzzle game when designing lures for specific fish.

It's relaxing if you just stick with exploring and fishing, or quite tense if you want to take on timed contracts or enter tournaments. The main storyline is short but it then opens up into a much longer end-game. I'm absolutely addicted.

Edit: To play well on the deck, you're better off disabling the controller in the settings, then binding WASD to the left stick and using the right trackpad as a mouse. The default controls are useable, but it's more of a mouse and keyboard oriented interface and the trackpad works perfectly.",SteamDeck

As for it not being verified, I wouldn't follow Steam's verified system. Instead check out ProtonDB. It has a much more accurate look on what games work on the SD or Linux in general. With that said, it has a rating of GOLD which means it runs well but with some minor issues. 

As I said before, battery life is an issue. Beyond that I did have it freeze on me once out of 10hrs or so of play. Might of been because I had it suspended a few times before rebooting the game. Also some text is off screen on some menus but it's usually just like the first letter of a word. 

In terms of not using MKB, the track pad works just fine. It's turn based so you don't have to be quick to use the track pad. I picked one of the higher rated Steam Deck controller settings for the game and just took off with it.

The game itself runs rlly well in handheld mode. 30FPS+ for the most part and the gameplay is rlly good. Highly recommend it!",SteamDeck

anything indie or older than current gen is really fun on the Deck, and prolly gonna go on sale on Steam.  although sometimes i'd rather play that stuff on the big screen.  like, both Creaks and Limbo play effortlessly on the Deck, but i wouldn't play creaks on that small screen cuz it wastes the art.

idk if it's possible with ps5, but when i played through CP2077 i'd do big important missions on my desktop pc, and pick up the deck to explore the world and do minor missions and interact with the world.  it worked out great.

i did a lot of Grounded with the same ethos- i'd build my base and accumulate wealth on the deck, and when my friends got together i'd hop on my PC and advance the story.

and again i don't know if it's possible, but i've enjoyed streaming games from my pc to the deck.  if the gameplay is easy and the story holds up i'll stream an AAA game to my deck off my PC.  maxed settings are a doddle for the PC and it feels super good.

i got a random usbc hub and have run 5 year old AAA games off the Deck and played on my TV with a controller.  the PC library is so much larger than what a console can offer.  go get mass effect legendary edition if you haven't played it yet.

ji8a0v7,I'm using emudeck and it's very easy to set up and use,SteamDeck
ji8aab6,"Emudeck is basically this. Plop it onto your desktop, run it occasionally, and it will update all its emulators itself, as well as put all your games into steam for you for easy access.

The only downside is if you have a bazillion games, in which case you shouldn't add all of them to steam with emudeck.",SteamDeck

Previously I had Batocera, which was OK, but it had me doing the Power + Volume down, select SD card to enter maneuver. Which was dumb and clunky. I ended up never using it.

Emudeck launches straight from the main Steam library. Took a little bit of finicking with to really improve my experience. It's fantastic.",SteamDeck

1. Then you plug your Deck into an HDMI congle
1. Plug that HDMI port into a USB HDMI capture stick
1. Plug that stick into a USB-A to micro/C adapter (depending on your phone).

Your phone will then see video from the Steam Deck come in as if it were a webcam, so you can just play content on any USB webcam app (there are a bunch on the Google Play store, and it's been a while since I've done this, so I can't tell you which ones are best for what you're describing).",SteamDeck

""the showers are at the back if you want to freshen up, if you want food just ask, enjoy"".  

When I went back that year, sigh... not only had that guy locked me up in a jail cell etc for hours after insane drug tests etc, he also phoned forward so that when I got off the airline in london I was literally met by security as soon as I left the plane, hehehe, more strip searches and xrays and whatever, lol.

ji7zbp4,the text means nothing,SteamDeck
ji83diq,"Unfortunately this.

Valve update release policy is... ""Very quick on decisions.""

So essentially they might push a patch on an issue they know will not touch critical parts of the OS, often on the day after they've pushed it on the beta channel, or sometimes even on the same day.

Then they dont write copy for what it does again, and wait for the translation team to finish translating that, but just reuse the text for the beta update.

Also from time to time they might break a thing or two with that (unrelated to games compatibility - although not in culture, but as in i dont mean games breaking, thats a different story with different factors playing into that), but then they usually are also very quick in fixing it.

Except when they arent and their gallery scrolling still stops working after 20 images or so, and you can never get it scrolling past that.. ;)

So lets say thats just valve - also thats not hugely problematic. (At least if they break stuff, they usually fix it very quickly.) But its not at all what any other vendor would do. ;)

They'd have 2 departments bickering over the release text copy of a patch for 2 meetings, Valve just reuses beta text.",SteamDeck

The hard part is we need a device where the extra usb-c port supports alt display mode. I have some docks that have both power and extra usb-c port but these all also have HDMI and the alt display function is routed to the HDMI port.

Since it’s prime on Amazon it might be with a try and just return it if it doesn’t work. If you try it can you report back here? I may end up looking for a monitor if it does.

ji6oidp,"I basically tried all viable options :-) here's a summary:

I really wanted to like Grim Dawn on the SD, but the UI is so clunky it gets too bothersome to play to me. Looting is terrible and even picking talents feels like a chore.

Without trading easily PoE wasn't it for me either. You need all kinds of extra software to enjoy PoE the way I like it. Knowing I would never easily run said software on a Steam Deck was enough to leave the game for now.

Last Epoch is pretty good but won't last you long without a power outlet. It eats the battery in less than an hour. Unfortunately it's an unfinished game and needs a bit more development in general. Lot of fun can be had here if you play plugged in though.

Haven't tried Wolcen on it, might be good but knowing the devs I doubt it's optimized. Played on the PC recently and it felt a bit dated already.

I also played some Hero Siege, it runs okay but it just doesn't scratch the itch for me.

Diablo 3 is decent with a controller. Inventory management can be a bit annoying but if you can get passed that it's okay. Same for D2 remastered.

This was posted here because I knew this audience would have the most knowledge about the Steam Deck in general. It's also important to note this isn't ONLY about the Steam Deck.

ji9gwre,">It turns out that a device designed for 800p gaming ain’t the best when you’re using a monitor designed for 1080p and up.

This is a messy sentence that could mean a lot.

* It could mean ""If you plug in a 1080p monitor into the SteamDeck, it will run sub-optimally because <insert complexities of GPUs here>.""

But you didn't say any of those things. You just said what you said, which can be interpreted several ways. That makes it hard to make a compelling argument.

&#x200B;

>but I personally don't think an efficient way to use the device and I go into here's why..

I don't think you are using the word ""efficient"" correctly.   Efficient means:

1. Acting or producing effectively with a minimum of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.
2.  Acting directly to produce an effect.
3. Causing less waste or requiring less effort than comparable devices or methods. Used in combination.

Well, having 2 computers instead of 1 kind of kills the first and 3rd definitions.  And the 'indirect' nature of the gameplay across the computers seems like it kills the 2nd definition.

You should claim ""it's a bonus mode that not enough people use"", or ""it will let you get more out of your SteamDeck"", etc. But I don't buy the ""efficiency"" claim, since it's really highly inefficient. (In terms of energy, complexity, and maybe even cost if you don't already have a great game box.)

&#x200B;

>It’s that ability to be able to knock out the more grindy, mundane parts of RPGs with the Steam Deck while simultaneously being able to head back to the gaming lair for the boss battles that makes this a literal game-changer for me.

The use of ""simultaneous"" is bad here, especially combined with ""head back to the gaming lair"" (an indirect euphemism that took me a while to figure out.)

If we were to rewrite: ""It's the ability to grind on the SteamDeck while simultaneously using my main PC to fight the boss battles"".

That. Is. Not. Simultaneous. Those things are happening at different times.

&#x200B;

>I'm merely trying to say I think I've found a way to allow for the best use cases of most users with the Steam Deck.

Citation needed. You can say it's best for you. You can say ""you think everyone *should* try it"". But when you say ""most SteamDeck users"", I say ""citation needed"". What percentage of people have existing PCs that are BETTER than their SteamDeck? (I certainly didn't, I had an old computer from 2014 that had trouble with a lot of titles.)

It's bad writing to make up data and just ""argue your point of view"". (""Like, that's just your opinion, man."") Good writing tries to understand the audience, understand things they might be confused by, and build arguments ""brick by brick"". (In fact, it's good practice to state who the audience is up front, so people can evaluate it from that point of view.)

>I ended up gaming less over time because my sessions were constantly cut short by the battery life.

ji65dof,">Does it meen just let it on default?

Yes.

> For example I use SMT off and 1000mhz for switch 

That's because Yuzu is CPU bound and uses 4 threads to emulate the Switch's 4-core CPU.

1000Mhz limit on GPU leaves power overhead for the CPU and disabling SMT means that the Deck's 4 Core CPU only uses 4 threads, 1 per core.",SteamDeck
ji75qsr,Yeah and ryujinx performs worse with smt off for me oddly enough. Must just be different.,SteamDeck
ji88kuw,">ryujinx performs worse with smt off

According to the [Ryujinx FAQ](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting):

>Ryujinx has 1:1 guest to host threads (but a scheduler keeps only one active per 4 cores at a time), there is one GPU command processing thread, there is optionally one GPU backend thread, there are up to 8 shader background compile threads, there is a dynamic number of JIT highcq background threads, and there are an unbounded number of ASTC decompression threads.

Ryujinx is running multiple threads so it benefits from SMT.

The Steam Deck has 4 cores and 8 threads. Turning off SMT sets that to 4 threads, one per core. Ryujinx needs multiple threads, so turn it on. Yuzu only uses 4 threads, so it's better to turn it off and dedicate 1 core per thread.

The basic rule of thumb is:

1. If the emulator is CPU constrained, lower the GPU power to give more power to the CPU since they share the power delivery.
2. If the emulator uses more than 4 threads, leave SMT on.

Similar to the witness in some way:
* Outer wilds (MUST play)
* Superliminal (MUST play)
* Manifold garden
* Braid (from the creator of the witness)
* Anti-chamber
* The Talos principle
* The Stanley parable
* The beginners guide
* Deliver the moon

Other puzzle games:
* Baba is you
* Fez
* Gorogoa
* Gris
* The pedestrian

Adventure and story telling (but easy)
* Reventure
* Undertale
* What remains of Edith Finch

Management:
* RimWorld
* Satisfactory
* Dyson sphere program
* Terra nil",SteamDeck
ji74lvv,"Caves of Qud is a classic roguelike (turn-based, grid based, no meta-progresion, ><@, etc) so still action, and it can get crazy, but it the action progresses at the rate you choose",SteamDeck
ji7lm4h,"As an older guy myself, there's a few games I play when I'm winding down that don't require a lot of twitchy gameplay. 

I play Tetrisphere from n64 on emudeck (there's good video tutorials showing how to set that up), doctor mario, that kind of stuff, older games I have muscule memory on. 

Also I play like Idle Slayer, which is a simple ""clicker"" style game where you can't die at all, you just try to jump for coins and build up your character's armor to get more coins per second (addictive little game), and another idle game from the DND universe that's closely resembling that. 

Other games I find chill are different point and click adventure games (scummvm has a lot of games they support, like kings quest and such). Also old style JRPG's aren't too twitchy as they let you take your time to select your actions (think FF1-6, psp had some nice remakes for those, and a few are on steam).  But really, most JRPG's aren't too stressful/twitchy.

Portal is pretty relaxing for the most part, not really a hard game.

Certain Mystery games where you try to solve a case, like the Phoenix Wright games are pretty fun (for GBA and DS I think).

I have a lot of fun with Geometry wars, it's like a twin stick shooter that originally came out on xbox original or 360, but it's on steam. It uses like vector graphics like the old asteroids arcade.

Pinball games are always super chill, like sonic spinball, Zen Pinball, etc.

Poker Night at the Inventory 2 works great if you like Texas Hold em or Omaha. And the characters are a hoot (Ash from the Evil Dead series, Sam from Sam and Max, Claptrap from Borderlands, and Brock from some cartoon I forgot the name of, oh and Glados is the dealer from Portal)

Other than that, there's tons of stuff I'm sure you will find you'll like that don't require reflexes of a 10 year old.",SteamDeck
ji7qkmm,"My favourite ""action games"" are stealth action and immersive sims. you can creep a long and recce for long periods and if you see an opportunity to pull off some badass action you can really build up to it and make a small sprint to pull off a john wick moment and then disappear and relax again while watching from the shadows. then go break into some rando apartment and read some emails for a while.",SteamDeck

Like you I tried many different settings and ""fixes"" but the only thing that actually made a difference to where I can play battlefield on remote play now at a decent pace and most other types of games like RPGs is upgrading my network equipment.

If you're using your big standard ISP router, they are garbage and just can't handle network traffic efficiency to allow you to stream I've found.

But after some time I started focusing on convenience. Games that were quick to start or that supported the sleep function. Basically transformed it into kind of a “Super Switch” :D

Meaning I started playing a lot of platformers, a lot of indie games (that actually brought me back to having fun with games overall having been a bit burned out by the AAA shenanigans), doing a quick delivery on Euro Truck Sim 2 before going to sleep, some sessions of Grim Dawn when I get the need for some action RPG. 

But the biggest breath of fresh air, to be honest, and probably as for many other people, was the emulation indeed. I don’t know if you tried it, but being able to play old games from my childhood and teenager years made me realise that the fun is not just nostalgia. Games were indeed more straightforward, complete, without hassle and logins and account creation and verification and aggressive monetisation schemes that break immersion and create barriers between you and the fun..

I suggest using ""device to device"" cloning as it will make a direct copy to your target drive. When it asks how you want to set up the partitions there's K0 and K1.

**K0 = keep partitions the same on the target drive as on the source drive.**

ji89axj,Nah. I actually started using Moonlight with Playnite and it's working far better than I really expected. The ally won't be powerful enough to justify switching given this. The screen would be nice though.,SteamDeck

MS gave up on mobile so I don't they're looking too rush in and support a mobile device. it does seem like a great device to run steam on in the big screen mode but I would have to try it first. In short, I’m not going to upgrade immediately, I really like the deck in the experience I’m having, and valve's customer support has been phenomenal.",SteamDeck
ji8tq6v,"If it had track pads and gyro, probably, but without them it limits the games I like, mostly RTS and management type games, plus my decks holding out well for what I need out of it so no point in upgrading while it can still play the games I like ya know. Also, Valve's support will go on for awhile, I can't see Asus not making an upgrade within the next year and discontinuing support of it's old models, and Valve also likes to experiment with there stuff.",SteamDeck
ji9i57n,"Possibly. 

Definitely _not_ on launch. If I ever get one, I will probably not boot into windows even once. Either the official steam os will need to work on it, or holo iso or another fork will need to be fully functional. And that would include steam os playing nice with the external GPU. 

The extra performance would definitely be appreciated, but not at the expense of having to deal with windows on a tiny screen without a keyboard and mouse. (Or deal with windows at all). 

I have a feeling that with the Microsoft sponsorship, the bios/bootloader will be locked down.",SteamDeck
jiafkkw,And give up the gyro and the touch pads? And the other 2 buttons on the back? And all the fixability? Nah. This deck will be in my family until it can't be repaired anymore.,SteamDeck
jiakeez,"I will replace my MSI GP66  i7 11800h RTX3080 165w Laptop + steam deck with the Ally + XG Mobile eGPU, it will be both faster and more convenient solution...maybe even cheaper if I'll grab the rx6850m eGPU for 1k$ from eBay. I use the laptop for media creation stuff like Abode Illustrator, Photoshop, mod creation for some games and so on. So basically a working machine and the deck just for gaming, but sometimes I would like to have the same files/OS/storage on both systems, so Ally is just perfect for me.
The Ally itself is just a normal PC/Laptop, not a console like the Deck (i run Dualboot deck with Win11 and SteamOS tho) so it shouldn't have any problems with replacing any windows device. With kb and mouse plugged in for sure. 
I love my deck but the performance in not optimized games is just bad...can't play the game i want with 60fps and i just need more...more tdp without too much extreme hardware modding and just more raw performance.
I will definitely miss the touchpads and two extra paddles...also all those steam overlays that allow you to create a ton of different inputs for old games...
But i also love the Asus ROG world and their quality + performance so i say bye to the deck..",SteamDeck

ji8snha,100percent selling the SD for the ally. No brainer for me,SteamDeck
ji8gl6o,No. If new thing is good enough I will simply buy it and compare then pass down which one I do not want to somebody I know.,SteamDeck
ji9ggj9,"So I know this will get me a lot of hate, but one thing to think about is the fact that other handhelds running windows mean they won’t have the 3rd party launcher issue and anti-cheat issues that is just plaguing the deck right now. 

Don’t get me wrong, these fraking publishers requiring another launcher on top of steam should be burned to the ground. That’s the best solution. I spent over an hour trying to get Ubisoft connect to work ont he deck, and what finally worked was a stupid command line change. WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE TO DO THAT??

ji8ve83,Honest question but what games would those be? I mean Hogwarts runs ~30fps on deck and will probably run ~40fps on ally but with much lower battery life. Is ~30% fps improvements really that game changing? The anti cheat I can see for sure though but hope that gets fixed in coming months.,SteamDeck
ji8sr5n,"I agree with you, I'm just a little unsettled by those recent ""Steam Deck competitor duuuh"" posts that have been popping out all day. I really wanted to see the responses I'm getting :p",SteamDeck
ji9cou0,"Exactly, Asus has no issues abandoning stuff and leaving it dead or dying while moving on to the next.  They did that with the ROG Phone 2 and that’s why I’m skeptical about an Ally; my phone 2 is a paperweight. A fancy one but a paperweight.",SteamDeck
ji9jqyl,"It's understandable, but really kind of inconsequential in this discussion. You can wipe the Deck and install Windows on it. There's no difference. Any consideration for something like the Ally should be about the device itself, not the OS. Windows runs on the Steam Deck too.",SteamDeck
jia55ns,"The Ally has no gyro? WTF

Well, they had to reach those prices somehow.",SteamDeck
ji8ze3g,"I won't know until I get an Ally :)

But you need to run both screens at the same resolution (1280x720) to determine the true real boost in gaming is, since the CPU and GPU are going to be important.  But the Ally is a 1080p screen, and I don't know if it supports GPU scaled lower resolutions.  Maybe you can create them with ToastyX CRU.  But how many people are going to test the Ally at 720p?

We already know the CPU is going to be much faster, which is why I want it for my chess study.  Running Stockfish Dev versions on the Steam Deck (windows 11 SSD boot) is painful.",SteamDeck
ji9jxiw,"But how well does windows run on the deck? Last I heard, it still didn’t have full driver support for everything, but that info could be out of date.",SteamDeck
jiapcst,"It may or may not have motion sensors, there is nor reliable information on that at this time.

The software aspects can be difficult and they may have opted to not steer attention to the feature until they can demonstrate it working as intended.

If it does have motion sensors they may only benefit in a limited way. The Deck enables more flexible use of its sensors by having hardware features that complement it such as touch sensitive stick tops and touchpads and more grip buttons, and direct integration with the most user friendly reasonably fully featured software for both DIY and native gyro aiming. Depending on the Ally's design and Asus' willingness to cooperate Valve may well implement support for its controller as they do various prominent controllers.",SteamDeck
ji9k8tl,"No, it runs fine. Any issues are just Windows issues, really, and you'd have the same problems with any handheld device trying to navigate with a controller.",SteamDeck

Then there's other soft factors, the Deck, obviously, integrates exceptionally well with Steam so if you're REALLY invested in Valve's ecosystem to the point of considering yourself a fan, that might be a reason to stick to the Deck either way. Still, I suggest you wait for reviews of the Ally & decide then.",SteamDeck
ji5yf3l,"> Why is it that valve isn't so concerned about coming out with a Ryzen Z1 version for instance,

In the end, Valve just want to get more people to use Steam, whether it is on the Steam Deck or any other PC. They don't have a strong reason to be in the hardware race.

> and what makes this device seemingly run every damn thing thrown at it

Basically Proton optimizations and less bloat than Windows.

> which I suppose is why I shouldn't be worried about it's ability to support AAA games?

This is kind of a yes and no. Spec-wise the Steam Deck is still pretty solid as of now. But it's a fact that devs sometimes don't really optimize their games for weaker hardware so some games will still run like shit on the SD and SteamOS/Proton can only do so much. Most will run, some will require tweaking and turning down settings, and maybe some won't be playable at all. 

Not to mention DRM and anti-cheat makes thing more complicated and sometimes you would need to install Windows, something which has low priority support on the Steam Deck.

The Deck would probably still run most AAA games (albeit some may not run so good) in the near future, but it's already using some outdated hardware at launch and no doubt it's gonna start to struggle more and more in the coming years when games will only become more demanding.

In the end PC gaming is still PC gaming. New hardware comes out all the time and devs will only aim for higher or be lazier and just rely on powerful hardware.",SteamDeck
ji64x45,"> Why is it that valve isn't so concerned about coming out with a Ryzen Z1 version 

Because they already put a ton of R&D towards designing around the Zen2 and it doesn't make sense for them budget that R&D towards a new chip until at least 2-3 years into the Seam Deck life cycle.

And, a lot of people miss the fact that Valve is more than happy to have competitors in this space. They want to drive the price down so that they can, in turn, get better prices from their component suppliers.

But the biggest thing is that they make money selling games. I'd be willing to be that Valve is going to make more money per Ally sold than they do per Steam Deck sold, because in the Ally's case they don't have to deduct manufacturing and support costs for hardware.

> I just really wanna know why the deck community are so glued to this particular device 

I personally think it's a great device that was worth the price I bought it for. A lot of the FUD seems to come from FOMO, whether anyone admits it or not.

> I'm not so sure I understand the true reasons of what would make me stick to this and not something else 

That's something you'd have to decide for yourself. Think about it like this, if you're the kind of person who upgrades their iPhone every year, than you're probably the kind of person who's ok with buying a new device like the Steam Deck every year. Because the Z1 might be hot right now, but in a year's time, everyone will be talking whatever the new hotness is.",SteamDeck

I don't use my deck for trying to play the latest AAA games, or playing FPS shooters, I use my desktop for that, so the huge upgraded processor isn't as much of a deal to me.

ji5xm59,"I think Valve should be concerned about both the Z1 and the Z1 Extreme. Not only for the Asus, but other makers.

Interestingly, these brands have chosen to go with Windows instead of SteamOS.

There's also the Switch 2. Now that will probably use Nvidia, but it could also shake things up if it is more capable than the Steam Deck. (Of course, it won't be a Steam-capable machine, but the Steam Deck won't be as attractive to switchers. A Switch2, more than any Asus machine, will set public expectations as to what a handheld should do.)

Valve's biggest problem right now is that it doesn't serve most of the world's markets. That's a hole that Asus and others more globally-focused companies can attend to, to Valve's detriment.

At the very least, I think this will put pressure on Valve to produce an OLED variant, to hasten their 2.0 plans, and, possibly, to dump the 64GB model in favour of at least 256GB.

The same goes for handhelds. The ROG Ally has better specs, but I stream from my pc or ps5 for AAA games most of the time, so comfort and versatility are going to matter more. I also play MMOs, so the button programming and trackpads are a huge selling point.

I have several consoles where one game or series justified the purchase for me: Tetris on Game Boy, FF7 on PS1, Uncharted on PS3, Halo series on Xbox360.

I have started playing Halo Reach on the Steam Deck though although I already have it for the 360 and Xbox One.

I use no addons and spent maybe 2-4 hours tweaking settings, binds, and ui layout to find something comfortable.

That said, I’ve hit 2k in solo shuffle and 2s on a few classes, have done every role in mythics and lfr, and most enjoy battlegrounds and questing.

Install is a bit weird, you have to use desktop mode, add non steam game from desktop mode. But actually doing the install you want to do from gaming mode. Then back to desktop mode to add the bnet launcher as a non steam game.  
Delete the installer. Everything else including installing wow you can do in steam mode.

ji0ihm0,I got a 64gb during the sale and mine came with a pouch,SteamDeck
ji1tuxv,I have the 256GB model and also have a pouch. Maybe because I ordered it early,SteamDeck
jhxfkxr,Deez who?,SteamDeck
jhxzf28,"Instructions unclear, strangled by charging cable.",SteamDeck
jhy8kiw,I mean it’s illegal where I live but we gotta smoke who cares it was just a dumb joke,SteamDeck
jhxdau7,I have the 256 and my case doesn't have the blue logo either. Another 512 perk?,SteamDeck
jhy4opo,I got one with my 64 GB!  Didn’t realize it wasn’t standard lol.  I stuff the charger in there and it works pretty well actually.,SteamDeck
jhxdqfy,I got the 512gb version and never got the pouch :(,SteamDeck
jhyhjef,"Interesting, I bought the 64 like 2 months ago, and it came with a pouch. It just doesn't have the blue logo like the fancy 512. I didn't realize that at one point they didn't come with pouches. So what fills the space under the center of the console? Is it just not accessible filler?

Edit: never mind, I was confusing the pouch (bag) with the indent in general.  Mine didn't come with the bag either.",SteamDeck
jhyp7mk,Weird. 64 and have one,SteamDeck
jhy7efp,I think they got rid of the lift strap because too many people thought it was for securing it in the case and they got a defective one.,SteamDeck
jhy1t75,subtle reminder we're not all americans on the internet,SteamDeck
jhx382v,same,SteamDeck
ji3hw19,"Probably. 512 GB version came with the pouch, colored emblem on the case, case also has a white zipper and a black cloth strip to remove the deck, and the etched screen. I think the cloth strip is typically white in the lower models and I believe they stopped including it, but I'm iffy on that part.",SteamDeck
jhynrc7,Sounds like a mistake. I’m telling,SteamDeck
jhyprib,"What's your case interior color, zipper colors, or the steam deck logo? My cousin just bought a 64gb and got black interior, black zippers, and a Grey non raised logo.

My 512 has Grey interior, white zippers and the blue raised logo.",SteamDeck
jhz1nu4,Probably by mistake. Enjoy your free pouch!,SteamDeck
ji463eg,"Okay, I see there was a miscommunication. I probably shouldn't have said ""pouch"". I'm talking about the little bag for the charger you can see at the end of OP's video clip, not the compartment in the backside of the carrying case.",SteamDeck
ji46b83,"Are you talking about the little bag you can see at the end of OP's video or just the compartment in the backside of the case? I noticed after reading another reply that it might not be clear what people refer to as ""pouch"" in this context.",SteamDeck
jhxfpg7,Deez Nutz!!!,SteamDeck
jhypben,For what it's worth man I thought it was funny,SteamDeck
jhxfmml,"Yeah the 512 one gets a ""special"" case so it's a little different from the 256 one",SteamDeck
jhyv9qa,That’s exactly what I do with mine. I put the charger in the pouch and put that into the indent on the back of the case under the elastic belt.,SteamDeck
jhxebll,You should tell steam support and get your free egg bag,SteamDeck
jhypwcl,Yup the former. Black interior etc.,SteamDeck
jhz3ukr,I got no pouch and the gray logo case with my 256gb,SteamDeck
jhz1im9,"I gotta say, except for the gray logo, I absolutely prefer the all-black case. Also I can confirm that that's the one you (are supposed to) get with the 256GB model as well.",SteamDeck
ji0jw5k,"If you bought them early enough, back when they had a wait list, the 512 has a grey interior, black zippers, blue raised logo, pouch bag for the charger, and a screen cleaning cloth.

They changed it as orders were going out the door, my guess is supply was not keeping up with demand for decks+cases so they cut the tiered system and people got what they got.",SteamDeck
jhzaspf,My case is unique yay :),SteamDeck
ji7slmg,The compartment on the back of the case!,SteamDeck
jhxnmrv,Got Eeem!!!,SteamDeck
jhzg8qi,"When did you get your Deck? I received mine at the start of April, also 256GB and it came with a pouch in the back with grey logo/interior.",SteamDeck
jhzlx2e,"Strange, here is my 64GB case

The inside is the same black as the outside.

jhzufs4,All good! Was just curious as a lot of people in this thread have such wildly varying experiences with whether or not they got a pouch below the 512 model.,SteamDeck

It's very easy to argue about what the prettiest game game out there is, with arguments about technical achievement versus artistic design. But there were moments with this game where I was just blown away at how great it looked, and then a full 5 second delay before realizing ""holy cow, I'm playing this on a *handheld*...""

I hate square is just doing that to basically have their cake and eat it too.

Tifa still got me crushing too NGL 😂",SteamDeck
ji9p6c3,I think of it more as a sequel (or requel?). I don't want to spoil it for people who didn't play it but I like that we are going to get something different in part 2 and beyond. It leaves FF7 as its own game and its own story.,SteamDeck

Was turned off by how quickly I was tasked with killing rats, and the battle system felt a little off to me, like they wanted to make a real time action battle system but felt like they needed to pay homage to the turn based system. The overall tone of the game felt much more melodramatic and anime inspired than the moody, atmospheric, and melancholy vibe of the original.

We got the same amount of Midgar, made very pretty, with the new Wall Market section being a major highlight imo. The extra interactions with the game world from the dart board in the bar, to the redesigned motorcycle section, to the cross dressing Cloud dancing section which had me grinning throughout.

The rest I found to be insufferably padded out. I did not care for the ghost things, as I felt as though they were a long-winded, pretentious way for the game to say ""things are going to play out differently than in the original and you need to be more open minded!"" It felt like they were spending too much energy defending their new story from potential purists/snobs/detractors instead of just letting their new story be, take it or leave it.

I went into the game with an open mind, and desperately tried to like it, so the stuff with the whispers didn't land well with me and only slowed the game down.

- If it releases on Switch, it should absolutely run on Deck unless the devs screwed up massively.
- PS4 games should work too.
- PS5 exclusives: these are the only games which can be too demanding. Or more accurately: too much work to make them run properly.

I honestly don't get why for publishers the idea is consoles should be 100% working on day one, while PC gamers can wait.

Add to the mix the ports for PC have been dreadful on the whole - the only way I can see things improving is if the Deck numbers are so high concentrated optimisation for the Deck is a high money spinner.

I'm happy to play what the Deck can comfortably run, I don't need it to run next gen AAA I have the PS5 & XSX to do that, I already stream latest AAA games from the PS5 & get the best handheld experience it can offer & I save money buying one game rather than two, one for the console, one for the Deck.",SteamDeck

It's a great machine, but by design it was meant to not be able to run modern AAA games after a year or two. And that's fine. Most games aren't AAA.",SteamDeck
ji6k6il,"Yeah, if you want a decent looking game the target framerate will be 30-40fps even for older titles - it's just not made for more.",SteamDeck
ji7euvs,"In retrospect Survivor was not a good example to use for what I was asking, but I'm not trying to run games designed for current gen console levels of power and I'm not really paying any attention to most new triple A titles, so Survivor is the only big triple A game that isn't expected to run on last gen consoles I'm really aware of atm. I didn't even expect RE4R to run well on the Deck, am seriously impressed I can get that game to run at 55-60 fps in Mercs. Oddly RE4 runs better in the survival horde mode than it does in the story, I assume because the three stages don't feature a lot of dense foliage, rain or a lot of dynamic light sources like the areas of the story the Deck slightly struggles with but I digress as that game is capable of running decently enough on my launch Ps4, or at least the demo was. 

I definitely could've worded the post better as well, but I really don't see why anybody expected Survivor to run well on the Deck to begin with, even before we knew about the massive file size or the poor PC performance. But given my general lack of PC knowledge and the fact it can run on the Deck at all when a lot of people are struggling to run it on top of the line rigs, the Deck is apparently far more powerful than I thought it was. So I was left wondering whether it's reasonable to expect the Deck to be able to run Survivor and other new triple A games when we do get well optimized PC ports, as I assumed that was a pipe dream. 

As someone who's been almost exclusively a console player from the 90s until getting the Deck, I'm pretty shocked to see how badly PC players have been getting shafted with poorly optimized products even now. I knew that was a thing back in the PS2 era, I've got some experience with awful PC ports from that era on an ancient PC years back. To the extent of needing to rewrite parts of a game's code to get a mod working (of the kind that apparently won't work on Linux from what I've read sadly) just to have functional controller support in a game that claimed to have controller support but gave me movement on right stick, nothing on left stick and no ability to remap anything despite having options to do so. Sad to see PC is still getting shafted hard even in a time where it's almost as mainstream a platform as the big three consoles.",SteamDeck

> Steam deck was never meant to provide a AAA experience.

What about the fact that it does?",SteamDeck
ji6r5q3,"That's exactly what I figured. I never expected Survivor to run well on the Deck and given the issues it has on more powerful hardware I'm impressed it runs on the Deck at all. Games like RE Village and 4 Remake can run on last gen hardware so I felt they weren't a good standard to judge by now that more games are being designed for the power of current gen consoles. 

I jumped from a launch model PS4 so beyond being impressed at how much the Deck can outperform it on RE Engine titles, I've got no frame of reference for how powerful the Deck actually is, though I never expected it to be able to run games designed for the PS5 and current Xbox at all, so it's more powerful than I expected it to be, hence my curiosity",SteamDeck
ji75ado,"While I'm happy to stick with the Deck, it'll be interesting to see just how far the ROG can push what a handheld is capable of. The fact the Deck can run a game like Survivor at all makes it significantly more powerful than I thought it was, so the ROG should be an absolute beast. Assuming it has reasonable battery life for all that power, competition like that is exactly what we need to have Valve go above and beyond with the eventual SD2. Not that they didn't already do that with the Deck itself, never imagined a handheld comparable to a Ps4 could be a reality but the Deck leaves the base Ps4 in the dust",SteamDeck
ji72q1g,"That's exactly why I ask, I didn't expect Survivor or current triple A games to run on the Deck at all but people were trying and given my lack of PC know how, I was curious whether it was reasonable to expect the Deck to handle a game like that even if it was well optimized. 

As for your point about playing them handheld though, I can definitely understand that perspective but I'm the exact opposite. The reason I got the Deck instead of a comparably priced PC is because I love handhelds. To the extent I used to get multi platform games on Switch instead of Ps4, unless the Switch performance was really poor simply, simply because I prefer handhelds. Say we get an SD2 in 5 years that is comparable to current gen consoles, I'd be willing to settle for 45 fps and slightly worse visuals than console just to have the handheld option in everything except fighting and character action games where I want at least 60. 

Besides all it takes is a USB-C to HDMI cord and I can play on any screen I want, though admittedly my TV is pretty old, so I have no idea how the Deck handles using a display that allows higher resolution than it's own screen supports.",SteamDeck

If that's the case then explain why so many other PC ports have released broken, Forspoken, The Last of Us, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk, Callisto Protocol, on and on. The day one patch and the weeks/months of patches post launch has become a standard and it sucks.

This is the lack of/laziness in optimizing games on PC and rushing titles out the door unfinished. EA doesn't need a meme to generate hate. They have done far more to inspire hate in gamers on their own but Respawn would be the studio to question considering they developed the game.",SteamDeck
ji7160m,"I bought a 3080ti two years ago, and I’m having a serious case of buyer’s remorse. I should have just stuck with my old GPU and kept buying AAA titles on console instead.

ji6q69f,"You know, the misguided expectations people have of the Steam Deck is what is most annoying because it makes no sense. If you went out and bought a low end gaming PC for $400 right now would you expect it run Resident Evil 4R the same way a $2000 gaming rig would with a RTX 3080, Core i9 and 16GBs of VRAM? No because that's stupid. The spec is wildly different. The power draw is wildly different even though both devices can run the same game.

Then why set the bar of expectation so damn high for a Steam Deck that's a portable computer running on mobile chip set at 15w expecting it to perform like a $2000 gaming rig? Steam Deck isn't running games ported specifically to it. Steam Deck runs actual PC releases. By definition, it's a low end device but too many people keep expecting it to provide high end results which is just asinine.

Steam Deck is not a high end gaming PC. It never was, it was never advertised as such yet people constantly go on and on ""mY gAmeS Aren't rUnNin' aT 60fPs oN mY Deck, iT sUcKs....""

You can check out their website too. They originally started out trying to make a smaller more travel friendly dock for the switch and this new one is even smaller than the one I use.

ji0g8ug,"That's sweet, I hope sharpness is coming next. I would love to be able to use the sharpness (RCAS) component of FSR without having to set game resolution to 1279x799 (which itself adds the significant overhead of FSR and a small amount of blur)",SteamDeck

ji0unc2,Unless undervolting is back on the menu I’ll stick to 3.4 with the option to undervolt and Vibrant Deck to sort out the colour vibrancy.,SteamDeck
jhzxoak,That's awesome!,SteamDeck
jhzftr2,"This is so good.

I love Vibrantdeck so much that I always think that should be something that the Steam Deck have by default, so the 100% of the people could enjoy it.

It would be really cool if Valve also increase the saturation by default, that everyone that update it's deck to the 3.5 have the Vibrancy wet to 140 or something like that",SteamDeck
jhz9g62,"I don't support vibrancy sliders. I think this is a mistake. Upping saturation will cause loss of detail.

What is better, is colour calibration. Unfortunately Valve did not include KDE's colour management panel, BUT, you actually can select a specific combination of settings in ""night mode"" which is used in game mode and that is a way to colour-calibrate the screen and you will get richer colours as well.

Saturation increase is not the right approach. Valve is wrong to do this.",SteamDeck
ji325jo,">that unlike the Decky plugin even works with external displays.

Is that supposed to be something positive???? Cause why the heck should it work docked on your TV, your TV should already have the correct color settings for all your gaming, it doesn't need to show what your slider changed, that's for the washed out Steam Deck screen only.
And if the TV shows it, it would look completely different to what you see on the Steam Deck screen cause like I said, the TV already has the correct vibrancy setting.

So this is pretty pointless.",SteamDeck

ji19el0,Yeah the boot videos have been there for a few weeks. I got a few and set them to random. Almost a shame I don't turn the Deck off now often but I like that we can preview them. I also like that the OG Big Picture intro is one of those available.,SteamDeck

ji167pq,It's in the main development branch and I'd suggest you to not get it unless you like to have a ton of small problems here and there with a small chance that these updates have you use a recovery image to reinstall the whole OS. It's highly experimental and Valve themselves let you opt in but stated that they don't make sure that anything breaks while using it.,SteamDeck

ji0j4yi,Well that might be slightly unrelated but I figured out that being able to add some sharpening in the game itself and enabling FSR creates a much better quality picture or just enabling TAA in game. It literally looks like native resolution to me after doing that. Good examples to test it on are Spyro Reignited Trilogy for TAA and Deep Rock Galactic for the additional sharpening method (set it to around ~110).,SteamDeck
ji12mho,"I wish they'd just include `vkBasalt` (which supports CAS, although it's slightly different from FCAS I believe) in the system image, which would simplify things a lot for less experienced users.",SteamDeck

ji0wr5g,I already reported about it being not only back but even toolless now: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/128nui6/steam_os_35_did_reset_bios_and_made_it_impossible/jhmpfrl,SteamDeck

jhzq1rt,"140? Try setting it to that and then try to tell two similar colours apart, it will be impossible. 120-130 is the range",SteamDeck
ji011p3,It isn't saturation increase and is actually color calibration and gamut mapping. It uses the Deck's primaries and widens them using a 3DLUT at scanout time.,SteamDeck
jhz9p9r,"Some people don’t mind the slight loss in detail for a more visually pleasing color saturation.

They’re not forcing you to use it.

Who cares?",SteamDeck
jhzdp6f,"**User choice**, is the right move. You don’t want to use it, you don’t use it. I mean you can be a graphical fidelity snob *(if you want, or anyone)*, and others who prefer the colour above detail can use this.

I actually mix the Vibrance with HDR shaders from ReShade in a lot of games, and some LUT shaders too to make things just right for me.

You also have to realize that on a screen the size of the steam deck, details are harder to notice/appreciate anyways. So the loss of some of that, for the benefit of richer colours is preferred by many.",SteamDeck
jhze6mx,Well it's an option so you are free to use it or not. And it is one that I personally enjoy to quickly adjust vibrancy while using external displays that have overblown colors or just giving more dull looking games a little more life.,SteamDeck
ji439uw,There are some devices that do not allow color setting changes. I have an nreal air glasses and they are ~~dark~~ oversaturated with no way to adjust. The vibrancy change will help a lot with that.,SteamDeck
ji0xl1l,"Thanks for the thanks, I really appreciate it!",SteamDeck
ji16ibw,It's not even beta. More like early alpha and has a ton of small issues like skipping menu entries while scrolling in certain lists and so on. Like I encountered stuff like that a lot and sometimes have to force shutdown the Deck as well.,SteamDeck
ji2auxh,"Well you can go into the really unstable main update channel and get it but you probably want to revert back if you use the deck as your main gaming device. Because there will be tons of issues with it. Trust me, I just encountered five issues today and had to do multiple reboots for it to just pick up an external display. And it will ruin many configurations that weren't made by Valve but by yourself and so on.",SteamDeck
jhzh9nu,The greatest thing is that Valve unlike other companies sticks with one product and really refines it before launching a new one unlike other companies. And that kind of determination and support is what really makes it special. I'm always about every new update that releases. Like I can't wait for the up to 60% smaller shader caches that will be implemented soon and hope that the new pipeline changes in Vulkan that enables asynchronous shader compilation (aka making them before you need them and you have some performance left for it). That might reduce them even more or even start to make them almost obsolete.. In a perfect world at least. Also the new power state based optimizations that will be implemented with a new AMD commit to Linux sound really nice and I want them now.,SteamDeck
ji0syhu,"This is going to be amazing on every device that runs steamos, not just the deck",SteamDeck
ji2ff9j,I love the Saturn one as well as the Dreamcast one. How I adored my Dreamcast! I still have it as well as my Saturn. The only old consoles I ever saved.,SteamDeck
ji2gkgd,"You can set them to play everytime you come out of sleep mode, that is what i did to mine",SteamDeck
ji17j6c,"They are working on the core features first and some fun side effects that are easy to implement will be added first like the new slider. Creating a whole new feature might introduce tons of new bugs and problems. They are refining what is there before adding new things or building better features on top of already existing ones first. Valve is also very aware about and cautious when it comes to feature creep. I doubt this will be implemented before they even fix the problem of not being able to change the language of desktop mode.

But I'd certainly like to have the ability to share clips with friends.
But that would probably also need integrated sharing features to external platforms on the Deck itself or the addition of an FTP server that you can access via the Steam App on mobile to do so. And that app really got no love for a long time now as it even freezes for no reason from time to time on multiple devices that I own.",SteamDeck
ji1vc36,Preview,SteamDeck
jhzfj6v,That’s sort of good in that it will be hard for anyone to *”over do it”*. Sounds like I will still be using Vibrant Deck though.,SteamDeck
ji0wu87,"Is the saturation good? Because with the Decky plugin, if I just slide overall saturation, it looks off. I have to dial down some Reds at the same time.",SteamDeck
ji0plv2,"I'm a dev on the Decky Recorder plugin, and have been tracking a bug in 3.5 that causes the deck to crash when you start the recording. I've updated to and back from main probably a dozen times by now, every time hoping that the bug is fixed.

Another thing that i would like to be more funcional is network folders, if i add one in desktop mode it works perfectly while in desktop mode, but in game mode its inacessible, all ""normal"" folders are readily available, but not network ones(i like networked folders cause i can leave my retro game roms in my NAS and play on any of my devices without transfering files or wasting device space)",SteamDeck

Saturation affects color intensity and enhances every color in an image. Vibrance is a little more specific. It saturates the parts of the image that aren't that colorful. This allows every color to stand out without making the composition look too busy..

Actually, even in the desktop pc market this happens, Nvidia has been doing it for so long that it isnt even funny

On what comes to consoles, yeah, its not normal to see a console last less than a year before the next one comes out, the only examples of consoles abandoned this fast are both from nintendo(virtual boy and wiiu)

but that isnt the only market the deck fits, also, while sony and microsoft are pretty good with support and updates, nintendo for example, just doesnt give a shit, 7 years, 3 different variations of their console in 500 colors each... And they still dont have themes, cloud saves are a mess, no dedicated server for any game at all and they took half the life of the console to add basic folders... Most of those being features their previous console had... 

So yeah, the deck support is amazing and valve should be recognized for it, just as sony should be recognized for the ps5 support, constant updates with improvements to graphics, performance and features, just amazing

Or you prefer how it looks by default or you prefer how it look with Vibrantdeck, there are just 2 options.

Dude don't be so stupid, saying ""95% of the people prefer..."" is just another way of saying ""most people prefer..."", Im not inventing percentages to be more right, is just another way of to express what I was saying -.-

>And I feel like you wanted to discredit my perception or knowledge about colours and displays since it does not match your experiences you made which wouldn't help anyone here

Wtf, when I said something that could make you think that? I was just asking about your opinion about Vibrantdeck in case you tired it, just to know what you think. 

For what I read in this sub practically everyone that used Vibrantdeck prefer it above the default screen colours, some people line to set the value to 125, other prefer 140 and other prefer 170, but practically everyone agree that with Vibrantdeck the steam deck screen looks better. For that reason I said that it would be really cool if Valve increase the saturation of the steam deck by default, and later the user that want could reduce it if they preferred it the other way.

ji2ew67,"Sorry, you're wrong. The complaint about the Steam Controller, and ensuing suit, had nothing to do with them stopping production. The complaint came out when the Controller was first introduced and Valve continued making it for **4 years** after that. In fact, the class-action was only brought up after Valve had stopped production and sold their remaining stock of it. Both the Steam Controller **and** Steam Link were created to push Steam Machines, and all 3 were discontinued because of horrible sales of Steam Machines.

Yes, all 3 also helped them plan their next steps (eventually leading to the Deck), but the people saying ""this was the plan all along"" have no evidence to back that theory. Valve's plan was to get people using Steam as much as possible, which meant making easier entries into the ecosystem. We can all agree it basically culminates with the Deck (though there's still some improvement to be made), but thinking that was how they thought it would all happen doesn't make sense.

ji4mevf,"The Samsung PM991a is definitely an option for the steam deck and will work as a direct replacement.     

However, there are several options for an NVME upgrade, so I ask that you consider the options and please don't overpay for an SSD.    

You can get the [Micron 2TB Drive](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR99P.shtml&order_id=323669245&sitem=B09WR99#Availability)  straight from a US distributor for $158. The same price as the [1TB Inland TN446](https://www.microcenter.com/product/663766/inland-tn446-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck). 
The closest *available* option to this is the 2TB SN740 from AliExpress for $160+ but it's a risk and you won't have a warranty if you're within the US. The Micron 2TB has also been listed on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/micron-2tb-2400-series/p/0D9-0022-000N1?Item=0D9-0022-000N1) for $160 but is out of stock and they have cancelled many orders from those that were able to place them when it came in stock earlier this week...

Alternatively, if that's out of your price range you can buy the [1TB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01112_B09WR98P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!#Availability) for $89.  Comparatively, the [1TB Sabrent Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) sells for $160 on Amazon. And if you're fortunate enough to live near a Microcenter, they also sell their [1TB Inland TN346](https://www.microcenter.com/product/649991/inland-tn436-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck) for around $130, now on sale for $109 to match the brand new [1TB Corsair MP600](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Storage/M-2-SSDs/MP600-MINI-PCIe-4-0-%28Gen-4%29-x4-NVMe-M-2-2230-SSD/p/CSSD-F1000GBMP600MN) that is also selling for $109.


A lot of people find the convenience of going to Microcenter to purchase and exchange/swap the SSD *if* it ever fails much more valuable than the extra storage space and that's fine, but I would personally rather have double the storage and a new backplate for the same price or less than either of the 1TB Inland Drives.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, and someone recently posted that they're entering their 4th week of waiting for a 1TB Micron from ShopBLT, but they don't mind waiting for such a deep discount.   

The Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740, Corsair MP600 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300. 

Here's [the specs and review](https://www.techpowerup.com/ssd-specs/micron-2400-2-tb.d810)  for it as well.


Regarding Micro SDs, there are 2 main cards that this subreddit will recommend.    

[Samsung 512GB Evo Select ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1HMJ9Z) as this doesn't have a 1TB option    
Or    
[SanDisk 512GB Extreme](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X7C2GBC/) this DOES have a 1TB option, so buy what's in your budget.   

Keep in mind that the Evo Plus and Evo Select are the same cards just rebranded for Amazon. I believe Evo Plus is what Amazon has the rights to, but they're the same.",SteamDeck

I still personally find that I need some form of AA on non old 3d games as downsampling can make the image quality even jaggier on the deck's screen. Also I think some games don't like when you're doing downsampling by non integer rates, as in you get some weird artifacts at 1080p (x1.5) but not at 1440p (x2) or 4k (x3)",SteamDeck
ji5a6xd,"It's just a term, it's not really a labeled setting you just flip on",SteamDeck

jhwjgbm,"This is a good thing, if the ROG Ally really is competitively priced with SD, then I hope it sells a lot to grow the market for handheld shaped gaming PCs.  If AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all take this market seriously, we will see much better processors get made that will go into future devices.  

I like the Steam Deck, it's made handheld gaming more viable for my lifestyle than any other system since the gba.  I'm glad there are competitors in the same price range that can blow it's features out of the water, it only means the next gen SD that comes out will improve on it better than I thought.",SteamDeck

After the long dead years of the 2010s, I think it's fantastic that CPUs are actually advancing at a perceptible rate again.  Valve have made it clear that they're waiting until the tech is available to make a really meaningful advance in the Steam Deck experience.  There will very likely be a successor to the Z1x that Valve will be looking at already that will be significantly faster than the Ally, and therefore *much* more powerful that the mk1 Steam Deck.",SteamDeck
jhwqdbn,"Valve don't care if the Ally is better. Any introduction of a new handheld device likely grows their core business which is Steam. More people gaming on PC handhelds which aren't Steam Decks means other companies are doing the heavy lifting for Valve.

They have absolutely succeeded seeing that there’s so much attention being paid to competitors like Ally, G Cloud and Edge, as well as prompting action from the console manufacturers. 

Valve is (and may never be) well equipped enough to compete like-for-like with hardware OEMs and console manufacturers, but their hardware reflects what they believe to be new horizons for gaming. 

Between living room PCs, remote play, unorthodox controllers and VR, this is the first time we are actually reaching that horizon, yet people are actively going against that just because they like the Steam Deck. There’s just no need for that type of response. It’s fine to prefer the device itself over others, but anyone who likes SD conceptually should be welcoming competition because that’s the entire point of SD’s existence. To inspire a new market.

I also predict that both Microsoft and Sony will get in the handheld space with Xbox and Playstation offerings in the next 2-3 years.

jhyntg5,"The top thing with the rog ally, is now that we have a big name player in the market, other big names will want a piece, and amd themselves started on apus tailored towards making that an easier reality rather than needing to specifically partner with a manufacturer each time. This also means a new generation steam deck with a higher end processor will happen more likely as production on these new chips at scale will make the cost of them more reasonable for valve to do so, as well as continue to rely on steam as the core money maker, keeping the consumer cost for a more powerful steamdeck lower than other devices again.

If Asus had licensed the steam decks controller configuration, it would be a no question better handheld, simply because of the better screen and the egpu connectivity. As it is now, there are trade offs on each side. More power, but limited to traditional controller controls only. Steam deck is less powerful, but has a more flexible control scheme.

Competition is good. I look forward to seeing what HP does under their gaming label Omen, or what Dell Alienware releases, Lenovo Legion?

I can see Dell Alienware actually bringing the handheld concept they had shown off in the past to market with its switch like controllers.",SteamDeck

Before the steam deck, the Nintendo switch was my favorite system of all time. I want to own my games. I want to be entertained by them when I want, not at a certain permissible time. The nintendo switch provided that for me. I only played my ps4 pro for vr games. 

But I absolutely love the Steam Deck because of the controls. I'm heavily into RTS's. With the steam deck and its track pads, that's no problem. 

I can play typing of the dead with my steam deck. 

The precision of aiming with the gyro and trackpad while setting myself up for a quick switch from a sniper back to close quarters armament with a touch of a button. 

I can play games and set them up in ways that I could only do with a mouse and keyboard before, and then I would have to switch to a controller to play my fighting games. The Steam Deck gives me a ton of accessibility. It makes my experience seemless. From what I've seen about the Ally, it can not. 

For what I want out of a portable system, that makes the ally inferior to me. It halves my games and increases my load if I want to take the Ally other places.  Deal breaker for me.

The touchpads just add so much functionality for me; I've been able to put hundreds of hours into keyboard and mouse driven strategy games, as well as set them to use a radial menu in many other games that also have heaps of controls and hot keys.

Also the website says multiple skus in the foot note but only one set of specs, to me based one the Z1 & Z1 extreme that amd showed off,  it'll be like this Z1 will be minor improvement over SD for an equal price (not really worth it for most) and if there is an extreme variant it'll be outside of a reasonable price range for most (this is the aya & GPD cut).

I don't care really care about the power of the SD, there are other factors that are far more important to me that I don't see the ROG having, namely the Steam Input configuration. Having the two touch pads, the back paddles, being able to map action layers, toggle between them, create radial menus, button toggles, rapid-fire, macros for key combos or specify clicks to specific areas of a screen... The tools that Steam gives you to customize your controls to translate any PC game to a controller is the main reason I love it. Hell, I would actually go for a weaker SD that's a little lighter, but keeps the steam input configuration tools. Oh - and the fact that you can share the templates you've made, and there are many years worth of templates already available to jump off most games with.

I don't care how strong the ROG is... PC games aren't really built for handhelds, and need something like the steam input. The steam deck would not have taken off without the many years they put into the steam input tool prior. If the ROG doesn't have touchpads, at least four back paddles, and a significant input tool, it could be more powerful and cheaper than the SD and I wouldn't care.",SteamDeck

We also don't know how user-serviceable it is, but knowing ASUS it will be very minimal (I'm guessing joystick replacement only, if even). So... $400 for a 64gb and slightly ""lower spec"" or an extra $300 for the upgrade. I don't think the SD is out of the competition, I think the 512gb one would probably be the most hurt by the Ally, since it's comparing only a $100 price difference. Depends on if there are tiered models or not though.

Overall I feel that they're pretty different devices all around. Seems silly but... The Steam Deck has trackpads which greatly expand its capabilities as a regular computer. The Steam Deck really is a computer first and foremost outside of gaming it really shows that it wants to do anything you want it to. The Ally not having trackpads won't be a dealbreaker for gamers but it will certainly make using the device more difficult (plus, more options are never bad.) Basically, I'm thinking the ROG Ally is really more of a competitor to the Switch experience having PC hardware, whereas the Steam Deck is just trying to be a handheld PC that just so happens to compete with the Switch. All 3 are portable handhelds, but each are trying to do something different. The Switch is trying to play games. The ROG Ally is playing games.

Are you gonna be able to find good settings for a game online? Is there gonna be something like emudeck? Will we have to update drivers?

If they can deliver atleast the same 3hrs with SD or even 2hrs with all that ""double the performance"" bells and whistles going on, I'm gonna sell my SD and buy their product.",SteamDeck

jhxlhvb,"First of all it has no trackpads. That's a huge downside. Second it does use windows 11 another big downside. But I admit that's second one is just me.

But I doubt that it will match the controller convinence steam has. The SD is smoothly controlled and I can even play mouse heavy games with ease. I don't see how that will go down without trackpads.

I am not really interested in asus take, mostly because I would have to endure windows again. But if they are successful good for them, I think the market is big enough for more players. And competition is good for the consumer. But I think they still have to proof that they are better, pure stats is really only important for a small minority.",SteamDeck

jhwh0pe,"Competition is a good thing. No doubt. I suspect there are some caveats to the Ally though. Namely price; nobody can subsidise the hardware with software sales on PC except Valve. So you're gonna pay for the top end hardware in the Ally. 

Second, the TDP/battery balance means realistically whilst you'll get a 1080p output on the ally, performance won't really be much, if any better, unless you're happy to live with a sub one hour battery.

I think the smart play here is to enjoy your steam deck, and wait for another generation of the Z1 to come along. The upcoming chips are super impressive, but only when they're pulling 30w. Which just isn't practical for a handheld.",SteamDeck

jhx3her,"I don't understand why Steam Deck fans are making such a big deal about price. Yes I get it , Steam Deck offers an excellent value for the money but it's a cheaper product with lower performance. Not everyone is looking for that and competitors need to make products too to push this space forward, otherwise we'd be stuck at the same performance level (which Valve already mentioned they might do for Steam Deck 2 and that would be bad). When the Steam Deck launched with RDNA 2 graphics, no handheld PC AT ANY PRICE could compete with the Steam Deck in game performance in all popular games. That's $1000+ handhelds that much lower game performance but it's different now, and there's going to be lots of adults like myself that don't mind spending the money for a more powerful competing product. There's also an issue of compatibility, no amount of value for a handheld will make someone buy a it if it can't play the game they buy it for.

I use my Aya Neo 2 like a laptop while docked. It can play most games much more comfortably than the Steam Deck and I use it like a PC because the non gaming performance is extremely good (not just for a handheld, against laptops too) and I don't have to worry about compatibility either.",SteamDeck
jhx5g9s,Biggest issues I have right off the bat with the Rog Ally is no trackpads and the asymmetrically placed joysticks. Add onto that no SteamOS and you’ve got yourself no dealio.

I have an SD, I don't need anything else for a very long time. I have 350 games in my backlog and the vast majority of them will probably work with the SD. I'm here to occasionally see something cool people are doing with their SD, or peep a game that works really well for it, or get tips about using it, or just keeping up with new releases and beta channel stuff.  


The SD is not my primary gaming machine, it's basically my road-trip/traveling console. That means a couple times a year I'll load something on it to kill hours in transit.

The ally, looking at the price of the rog phones will have a significant price hike compared to the deck and be targeted at a high end user market. It won’t be competition for the deck as it will have a different target audience similar to the ayaneo which again I don’t look at as competition as the target market is completely different.

jhwuwct,"There was one thread about it the other day that nearly made me think this was more of a cult than a group of people who enjoy the same thing coming together. So many comments just absolutely shunning those who think the Ally might be worth looking at. Just because Valve are being the ‘good guy’ right now doesn’t mean they should be a monopoly. So many companies become complacent when they’re top dog for too long. Just look at Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA. Even the next SD generation isn’t supposed to have a performance uplift according to rumours, just a better screen and battery. We keep treating this like a console when it just isn’t, it’s a PC handled portably. If there’s competition like the Ally, it may force Valve to actually give us more performance alongside the better screen and battery. Marginal upgrades are toxic, especially when they’re targeted at the already existing user base. I won’t stand for when Apple does it, I won’t stand for when Intel does it, and I won’t stand when Valve does it. If Valve’s release target is once every 2 years, then based off of other hardware OEMs, they have plenty of time to do both. 

I love the steam deck and what’s it has done for the market. I’m sure this is a hot take but it’s the reality we face. We need to look at what’s coming next and we do 100% need to consider other factors than itself, especially if they do end up coming into competition with it.

Out here paying 200+ for mice and keyboards alone. 2k+ for a laptop. Sure, the Ally might outperform the Deck, but at what cost to your wallet knowing the trend of Asus ROG prices? I could arguably see them ranging from 800 to over 1k, especially if they do multiple models like SD did.

I still prefer the SD for the 4 customizable backpedal with trackpad. The smaller resolution is annoying when using Windows on it though. Even if you can get games with anti-cheat working on your SD unofficially, it is primarily because the developer/publisher is looking the other way and there's no guarantee they would not ban your account suddenly. You have to understand that and is willing to take the risk since there is no safety net.

If you rarely ever see yourself needing the 4 customized backpedal input nor mix input control (mouse + dpad), and play using vanilla controls with the occasional use to switch to mouse mode using the backpedal, the ARA is the superior options if you have the money. This is especially the case if you only plan on playing on Windows only, since there are games that can only run on Windows due to anti-cheats.

- Gyro in Windows sucks. It works but not as smoothly as on the Steam Deck.
- trainers / cheat engine / plitch / we mod / mods / fluffy manager / etc will work easily on a Windows machine
- play all games from different launchers easily
- battery will not be worse or better in the Ally vs the Deck. I expect it to last at least 2hrs while gaming. I have the Win Max 2 that has a 1600p screen and I can play Assassin's Creed Valhalla on it for over 2hrs with no problem. The Win Max 2 has 6800U which is a less efficient chip compared to the Ally's Z1 Extreme, I expect the Ally to be better in terms of battery.
- looking at the motherboard, it seems a 2242 SSD can be ""fitted"" in",SteamDeck
jhx5sbs,"I am hyped about the ally. I wont be getting it because i have only had the steam deck for a little while, and only got it for a retro emulation device that cam do some modern gaming. 

And it does what i need with great results. 

I wont be upgrading for another cycle or two, unless i break something. 

But i am hoping this is the start of a emerging market of affordable and capable devices.",SteamDeck
jhx5ta6,"If there’s one thing I learned from using Asus ROG parts in my high end PC build, it’s that their hardware is awesome, but there support is some of the WORST I have experienced in any industry, period.

jhx5yfn,"I do not regret getting a Deck a few weeks ago, I still personally would rather buy from Steam themselves because it feels like it guarantees the least hassle-free Steam experience for me. But I also understand I’m an outlier in the community — I literally just use the Deck as a handheld PC, and do nothing outside of just run Steam games on it.",SteamDeck
jhx7x6g,"In some way I’d rather it be better spec wise and competitively priced as competition is good. The steam deck will look like the bargain in comparison and will grow the base.

I’d personally with my money rather not have some thing that is a spec beast in a handheld as that isn’t the way I’d want to play primarily. It takes away the sparkle of what the deck is with steamOS and emulation. Just doesn’t seem cool to be like “yeah but I can play that AAA game on the bus at max specs for an hour” to me…",SteamDeck
jhx7z6w,I'd get this if they produced a lot more eGPUs and made them significantly cheaper.,SteamDeck
jhx8b75,"I don't really worry much about the ROG ally because I don't see myself spending too much in a device like this. I think 450£ max is a good limit for a handheld. Anything higher than that probably cover a different market. Also, the community behind the SD is important and for some people is the reason to choose one or another. Not to mention the lack of trackpads... It leaves out the 60% of games I normally play on the deck.",SteamDeck
jhx8cbp,Seeing price reports of 659 or something like that,SteamDeck
jhx8g3s,"That LTT vid about the Ally dropped literally like two days after I put in my order, so I was a tad annoyed, especially about the higher refreshrate.

Then again we still don’t know the release date or how much this will cost, so we shall see. What I am really wondering about as well is controlling the desktop with the Ally, it doesn’t seem to have any mouse-esque type of abilities?

jhx8rje,"The Steam Deck is a neat little device. The integration with Valve services and most importantly, the lower price will still be important factors for the Steam Deck sales and Asus can't really compete with that. The Steam Deck is not the first handheld PC device but being affordable is what makes it so popular.

But overall, more competition means that the Steam Deck 2 (or whatever it will be called) will have to significantly improve the recipe, and that's quite good news.

If the Ally is better performance-wise after all and you are ready to spend more money for it, well just buy it.

But personally, I had a lot of issues with Asus devices being poorly designed (electronic-wise) so I will not buy it. Also, the Steam Deck is already enough for me...",SteamDeck

But I have a deck, and I love it. I won't be upgrading to the Ally any time soon because I'm satisfied with my SD. Unless someone buys me an Ally, I'm completely content with sticking to my deck. 

Perhaps the next gen of handheld PC's will get me to upgrade. But we'll see. 

TLDR: You're right and the Ally will be better. Which there is nothing wrong with that.",SteamDeck

jhxa34r,"Does a console that costs twice as much and is produced year and a half after the original can be called ‘better’? Of course. Will it provide better experience? We shall see. 
- The fps would probably see 20-30% improvement with everything else the same. 

- Battery life may be the same or worse (Steam Deck is super efficient at lower wattage). 

- Absence of trackpads may be a problem for games that require mouse.

- 1080P display may be slightly sharper at 1080 resolution, but don’t expect to play games in 1080p and expect the same FPS as Steam Deck that plays games in 800p. Maybe the most simplistic arcade games would be playable at that resolution, but any graphics demanding games would need to be scaled back to 720p to be playable. 

- ASUS support have been famously poor with their gaming laptops, but we shall see how they are going to handle gaming consoles that are a different product line. Just don’t set your expectations very high.

- Where we will see the biggest improvement is in games played while plugged in. New AMD chipset can provide a really good 1080p experience on a big screen when it can flex it’s muscles at maximum wattage. So if you play a lot of the games at home on a big screen, upgrade from Steam Deck would be probably your best option.",SteamDeck
jhxa556,"Biggest miss for me is at least the touchpad. I find that the Steam-button + touchpad for a quick mouse action is essential if you want to run titles that are not optimized to a t for console gaming.

jhxbb2u,"Having actual competition in the market by bigger brands is a good thing - it legitimizes the segment and will lead to more focus on interfaces that take advantage of the strengths of the form factor.  At a minimum, more devices like this will push Microsoft to focus on more handheld-friendly UIs (assuming that most of the Deck competitors choose to ship with Windows instead of using something like SteamOS).

Regardless of what the market looks like a few years from now, Valve definitely laid the foundation for what these types of devices should look and act like.  Nobody would be making sub-$1k handheld gaming PCs if Valve hadn't taken the leap first.",SteamDeck
jhxbd4l,"This might be stupid on my part. I didn't NEED the Steam Deck, but I wanted it to exist. So my Steam Deck purchase was for a vote with my wallet vs. a purchased need. Good portable gaming and a bonus is that it is on Linux.  I do use it from time to time, but I am super happy to see other competitors arise.  IMHO, my biggest problem is not being able to play game-pass games on the device without an internet connection or having to dual boot.",SteamDeck
jhxbm0t,"It's down right tempting and will make a true disruption to both the steam deck and entry level gaming laptops.  I just think the people who already play tethered to a power adapter will reap the real benefit.

ASUS is treating it like a gaming laptop, so the portability vs mobility eternal argument continues.",SteamDeck
jhxbzg0,"unless they come in at an agressive price point, this is just going to be like all of the other handheld PCs juist with a bigger brand behind it, however this is Asus, i dont see them coming in at an aggresive price point. we see though",SteamDeck
jhxc6nq,"I’m fine with it being better in some ways and doing well. For me the trackpads are a deal breaker. Otherwise I would have considered one.

jhxe16b,"Competition is always good for the end customers, so we should really hope that the Ally is a good one.",SteamDeck
jhxe3gr,"I like options as well.
Said that, Ally is different category altogether - it aims at handhelds like GPD Win3 rather than SD imo, thus not really competing directly.",SteamDeck
jhxe7tq,"I don't really see it as competition. Yea, it'll be better performance wise but it will also cost a ton more, making it a very premium option and that's fine for those that want more power than the SD can put out but most people are happy with the SD performance and probably don't want to shell out 1k+ on a handheld.

It will also likely be missing many QOL features that the SD deck has though, like trackpads, high control customisation etc.",SteamDeck
jhxe8vb,Another good handheld would be good for the market. I'm hoping someone can manage to create a piece with similar aspects that can actually compete in the 400$ price range. This would be amazing.,SteamDeck
jhxeckd,Out of my price range though and totally happy with my Deck. Only use it for work.,SteamDeck
jhxeswl,"Will nobody mention that the best part of StemDeck is the presence of 2 trackpads and all the configurability that steam provides for the controller?

I'm not a linux user and dealing with SteamOS is a pain in the ass sometimes so I won't defend it.

I tried putting windows on my SteamDeck(256gb btw) and I was really surprised by the fact that trackpads and all related configurations still worked well for steam library games. After tinkering for a while I moved back to SteamOs because I wanted to apply controller configurations to all my games (GW2, DA:Inquisition, etc).

Assuming that money is not a problen, I think Asus ROG Ally will be a better option for people that only wants to play games with native xbox controller compatibility, but is really far from being the ""steam deck killer"" that the media announce.",SteamDeck
jhxeuve,"It's a good thing for the ally to be better.  Not only does competition create innovation,  but also steam still benefits from it either way because it's the biggest storefront.  

Steamdeck paved the way for these handheld pc consoles, and I look forward to see what else valve releases but also what other devices come along from competitors",SteamDeck
jhxf0al,"Finally a sane take. This shouldn’t be console wars. We’re all playing the same games and there aren’t exclusives. The further handheld hardware is pushed, and the more reason for companies to be competitive on power, price, etc., the more we as consumers win.",SteamDeck
jhxf2wp,"I see this as a good thong for the market, need competition to spur on progress.

Plus I like to think this will open up the steam deck to actually have native and straightforward support for other pc marketplace because I gotta admit I'm not great with this manual proton system and control incompatibility with some games",SteamDeck
jhxf34g,One of the best things about the SD is the pause on demand. I can shut it off and pick it up 3 days later and pick up exactly where I left.,SteamDeck
jhxf38b,"Yeah, exactly. You think the Deck is good? Just wait until NVidia partners with whomever to make a competitor to the Ally, and Valve comes back with a souped-up OLED Deck, and then Microsoft gets into it with a whole new generation of chips and then...and then...

This is *exactly* what we want.",SteamDeck
jhxfchi,"No doubt the ally will have better performance and some decent features.  

However steam deck has its own features that are better than the ally and also performs exactly the same with current software as the day I got it.

Asus need to do much better if they want my money.",SteamDeck
jhxfgxm,"The Ally looks great from a spec perspective. I do thing the Deck wins in:

* Trackpads
* Community (tbd for the Ally)
* SteamOS (Windows is more of a resource hog but obviously has its own advantages)",SteamDeck
jhxfobg,"It’s just the stupid console war mentality. Sadly the handheld community won’t be immune to it, but that’s just how things are.",SteamDeck
jhxfspk,"The Steam Deck is doing exactly what it was supposed to, develop a new platform and encourage other manufacturers to enter that arena. Especially since Valve/Steam is more a software service, if others develop hardware it runs on it's still a win for them.

Kinda like (I imagine) Tesla in its early days. Yes they may have been the first to develop electric cars, but they've proven demand and now others are getting in on it.

This is one of the good sides of capitalism.",SteamDeck
jhxfwin,"The pros of Ally

* Competition
* More PCs in kids hands. Mobile gaming platforms and streaming services (Netflix, Amazon, Google) are threats to a healthier gaming. Android and IOS store conditions kids to accept predatory practices, developers use psychology to prey on kids. The kids then give their money to these bad actors and grow their business. They then migrate their greedy tentacles to PC. Nothing against gaming on mobile or streaming, just that companies that poison gaming get growth and money to expand that way.
* You can install SteamOS on it
* Pressures Nintendo to open up their hardware i.e not have alot of restrictions in what you can do with the hardware.

The cons of Ally

* Asus seems to have partnered with Microsoft, I assume Microsoft is subsidizing the low price of Ally in order to protect Windows dominance and promote Xbox/Game Pass. As long as Linux market share is low it will act as a detergent for developers from supporting it. Ally sales will boost Windows market share, staling or slowing down Linux market share. This is bad because if Linux reaches better market share quicker, developers will be quicker to enable anticheat for Proton which would make their multiplayer games run on SteamOS.

I am a proponent of Linux but I'd take Windows (PC) being adopted more over closed handhelds like Switch and mobile gaming with it's toxic and predatory game design. Not saying Switch is toxic like mobile platforms, I just like open platforms that let's you have as much freedom as reasonably possible.",SteamDeck
jhxgi56,"I’m glad there’s competition but there are too many things about the Ally that eliminate it as a purchase for me personally. I know most people will overlook these things but I won’t.

The ugly design, offset thumbsticks, Armory Crate interface (has anyone used Armory Crate on PC? It’s not a good piece of software), having to use Windows 11, etc.

It’s just not something I would buy, even if the Steam Deck didn’t exist.",SteamDeck
jhxgiac,Except for controller layout. I don't like the Switch layout because you have to coke up on the right to use that joystick and it's terrible for my hand. It's probably nowhere near as bad as the Switch but I still much prefert how the Deck handles the layout.,SteamDeck
jhxgtji,"Honestly, if it pushes valve to improve the deck and encourages miss competition in this field, it's nothing but a win. I'd love to have a ton of options when the time comes to upgrade my current deck.",SteamDeck
jhxgz0b,Yes but it's significantly more expensive,SteamDeck
jhxh0l9,It looks cool but it's hard for me to part with money so aslong as my steam deck can play the fighting games I buy so I can dock sd in living room to play with friends or take deck with me to dock at someone else's setup I'll be using it till the wheels fall off lol,SteamDeck
jhxh4xw,"Competition is absolutely a good thing, but I'm always gonna go for the closest to a Dualshock/Dualsense controller layout so I'd still prefer the Deck for that alone",SteamDeck
jhxh80g,"competition is a good thing, product isn't for me and that's okay. I'm happy with my purchase and I'm not gonna take away someone else's joy because of it",SteamDeck
jhxh92d,"Yeah it's really exciting but personally all I see it as is a way for valve to have some competition in the space even if it's better overall or in many ways its probably a pipe dream to think it would dethrone the steam deck.
Mostly because of the name and recognizeability that steam has people will likely gravitate to the SD unless they are enthusiasts or is the ally is fairly priced. 

Plus imo the ally is kinda ugly as hell",SteamDeck
jhxhaa5,"Competition in this market is good for consumers, just imagine if Steam v Asus gets big enough, it might force Nintendo to actually give the switch a good upgrade. Sony might bring back the PSP, the diversity of new handheld consoles will be amazing! The era of handheld gaming is surely returning!",SteamDeck
jhxhajo,"To my mind it’s nothing like a serious contender without the trackpads. As soon as I saw that my interest level went to zero. I mean I could probably bumble through on mouse games on joysticks but why would I want to when the Deck has these? I use them so often.

Secondly SteamOS is just so good and so configurable. Devs are really pushing to go Deck compatible. Will that be the case with the Rog? 

Not for me I think but as you say, competition is great.",SteamDeck
jhxhh76,"While competition good, one big point for me is the track pads. Why don't other developers see the benefit of trackpads? 

Either way, this is a win for Valve. More sales for them, and if they make a new gaming market of affordable gaming PCs, rock on!",SteamDeck
jhxi438,"Performance is not everything…
A Rog Ally will never be mine…",SteamDeck
jhxih9j,"Really though this is what valve wants. The SD is a way to showcase steamOS on portable devices and they make a little money and get good PR out of it. It has also been out a while. Technology is still changing at a very rapid pace, without iterations it will eventually lag behind.",SteamDeck
jhxilt0,"I think ROG Ally will cannibalize all the Aya NEO GPD and similar because it is better engineered and with low price, but the Steam Deck will be still viable because of the additional input and Steam OS",SteamDeck
jhxiqrk,Well said. More handhelds in the market is a good thing. I hope we start seeing more and more companies throw their hat in the ring. I’d love to see a dedicated Xbox handheld starting at $299 or something to really compete with Valve and the Deck.,SteamDeck
jhxjdkw,"The Ally is cool, I'll probably get one and love it.  However, the Steam Deck has been and will continue to be a fantastic adventure and will always hold a special place in my heart.  I expect the Ally to be more of what I'm already used to, a Windows PC in my hands.  And that's great.  But the Steam Deck taught me a considerable amount about Linux, about emulation, and about hardware and software customization. It got me excited to learn and reap the benefits of tinkering and tweaking.

I also brutally broke my arm in July 2021 and I pre-ordered my Steam Deck the day I got out of the hospital.  It was something I looked forward to for the following 8 months and 2 surgeries.  It arrived when I was still struggling with recovery, and it helped me immensely through a very dark time.  So, we bonded on a level that I don't expect will occur again 🙂",SteamDeck
jhxjlm7,Exactly I think people do not really understand that the real unmatched strenght of the SD is not it's performance but it's cost convenience. Many gamers just dont have (or dont want to spend) more than 500/600 dollars on a handheld no matter how powerful it is. Thats a big part of the reason why (in my opinion) the SD is so popular.,SteamDeck
jhxjn4p,I’m not interested in any handhelds that don’t run SteamOS perfectly at this point. And I’d also need all the same updates from Valve in a timely manner. Part of the Decks appeal for me is that it improves the UX of PC gaming dramatically. I don’t want to go back to a janky windows setup. There aren’t any games I want to play that can’t run on SteamOS. I’m limited only by hardware power. Maybe in some far flung future the windows handheld experience will be good enough but I’m not anticipating that happening in the next couple of years.,SteamDeck
jhxkl8g,The ONLY thing I've seen worse on the ally is the sheer number of inputs. It's across the board better except SD nailed the inputs.,SteamDeck
jhxkrkj,"The one way it's definitely not better is that it has the same controller layout as the switch with the right analogue stick directly under the face buttons which ergonomically for me (and others prob) is not comfortable. It's the main reason I don't play switch handheld, although I've just found hori do joycons with offset analogue sticks which for me is a gamechanger.

Steam decks layout is perfect for me, I don't care the B button falls off the side, it's infinitely more comfortable",SteamDeck
jhxksj9,Steamdeck 2 will be better too,SteamDeck
jhxktpu,"few things, in terms of screen and soc, its already miles ahead but thats not what 'portable' gaming is about for most of us. asus is a big hardware first corporation, valve isnt. this means when valve brings in people, its people who are there to contribute to a good, well thought out product (look at the vr headset), where as asus' people need a product that meets the specs, they may not care 'as' much about the user experience as valve. that also means no touchpads, fewer back buttons, less support for software etc. valve is a software first company, the deck is evolving to user needs, and the hardware was the same (affordable, ergonomic, caters to everyone), where as asus is aiming for fancy stuff even if it means many of the people cant buy (or use) it. its this difference in agenda that makes deck better imo,  like i'd be more than happy if ally had a better processor and a more 'color accurate' screen and touchpads and more back button and wouldnt care about a fast screen or all the rgb or dual fans etc etc but thats not what asus is going, its intentionally aiming for the niche and thats why deck is better, its aimed at everyone and its EXTREMELY WELL THOUGHT THROUGH wrt ergonomics and what a player would need to run old (and new) games on a portable device. like agenda during the reiterative processes matters when one is reiterating to to make preselected features fit and other is reiterating to see if the features even make sense and what can make the overall experience better (ie what would i do differently vs how i'd do whatever i'm already doing, differently)",SteamDeck
jhxkwgd,It's gonna have to be priced right imo. It's got solid specs but Asus likely can't afford to price like Steam Deck which hurts it imo. Unfortunately I am a baller on a budget so bang for the buck matters a lot to me.,SteamDeck
jhxkxqd,I am glad the ROG Ally exists due to the competition it will bring but it just seems overkill for handheld gaming.,SteamDeck
jhxl781,"Wrong, GPD Win 4 is obviously far better.",SteamDeck
jhxlh55,"The Asus ROG Ally has nice specs and will be able to natively run other game launchers and other windows apps which is nice. But I feel like windows brings other baggage with it. Steam Decks OS is the secret sauce, and the user experience will definitely still be better there. I’m sure Valve will come out with an upgraded Deck at some point, but for now you still can’t beat the value. Also… people complain about the Steam Decks battery…. How long will the Ally’s battery last while it sucks up more power to fuel it’s stronger APU? The extra performance does come at a cost (in more ways than one).",SteamDeck
jhxlxda,"Oh I love what I've been reading about the ROG Ally my only problems though is them having proprietary connectors and an attachment dock that's $2,000 I understand that it has a new generation video card in it but Jesus Christ.

jhxlzdw,A device that costs twice as much will have improvements? Who would have thought?,SteamDeck

jhxn4da,"I kinda want one if the rumor of $699 is true. It’s also apparently lighter and about the same as the Switch in terms of weight, but I wanna see battery numbers, this thing is running a full 1080p 120 HZ Display and even with FreeSync of there isn’t a way for me to control refresh rate I may not get it, cause I’d feel like taking a charger everywhere",SteamDeck
jhxn60k,"The more competitive these other devices are, the better Steam Deck 2 will be. Asus can’t support their device like Valve can theirs. It looks like a good option and I’m glad it exists.",SteamDeck

jhxnn4x,"In terms of power, sure. Steam Deck is still going to have way more support which means it provides a better experience in that way. We also didn't spend $1000 for the thing.",SteamDeck
jhxnxa6,"So it’s going to be quite a bit more powerful, but pushing a 1080p screen I wonder how much of that extra power will go just to upping the resolution. I guess it’s always possible to drop the resolution though and really harness all that power.

jhxozew,"It's gonna be a lot more expensive. 
Also the main reason why I got myself a Deck is because it runs Linux. Not because Linux is better for a handheld, but simply because I'm a Linux fan.",SteamDeck

jhxpwsd,"Is this a Linux machine or one of those Android Phone ""gaming"" tablets?",SteamDeck
jhxq1km,"I mean, of course it will be better for the time being. It's using newer, more powerful hardware with all of the experience floating around with how to make better consoles generation-to-generation. Does it make the SD any less awesome? Not even a little. The amount of flexibility the Deck has overall just can't be beat, and it will always be better at certain things.

We're just in the handheld PC's version of the console wars of old. But once things get even more powerful it'll come down to your choice in peripherals and software.",SteamDeck
jhxq1pl,"More the merrier I say. 

I like my SD, I use it everyday, but what I play on it... I don't need a stronger device. I have a gaming PC for that. 

In terms of bulk and size difference, I think the SD is fine. 

As long as you're not treating it like a gameboy sp or something. 

But even with this Asus... Would you really treat it any differently than a SD? I mean... It's smaller, but I feel like the use cases are identical.

I dunno. Chances are Asus won't be as competitive as the SD. Valve gets you in for 300 to 600 dollars.then makes 15 percent on games.

I know I look for games that would be good on the go, games I wouldn't play on my PC. 

But to the enthusiastic handheld gamer-- it might be worth it. 

I'm the guy that, if I bought a console, it would be last gens console. Maybe I'm not the market for the high end console/handheld. Then again, inhabe a 1080ti and all my games run fine. So. I dunno",SteamDeck
jhxq6no,"I don’t really agree.

Sure, the specs will be better and it will run windows without having to install it for those games that need it. For many games with controller mappings out of the box, you’ll get a nicer experience. But steamdeck is this crazy project to replace a gaming pc and have a whole host of games made for mouse and keyboard be a pleasant mobile experience.

So I would say that steamdeck is one kind of product, and the Ally is a different kind of product. They have some overlap, but the steamdeck is going to be way more versatile, hackable, and community supported. It’s apples and oranges, just like there’s no point in telling people that the steamdeck has better specs than a switch. Of course it does, but it’s not for the same audience.",SteamDeck
jhxq7hw,I think we are really seeing the beginning of an exciting time! I really love the concept of handheld pc gaming and I can’t wait to see what else we will be getting.,SteamDeck
jhxqh6c,"Will the ROG Ally have better specs and/or slimmer bezel etc? Yes. 

Will I care? No. 

Why? Because I bought the SteamDeck because of 2 + 1 things:

- I wanted a new PC for playing GuildWars 2 and for it being a mediabox on Linux without paying the Microsoft tax
- I was willing to pay a bit of extra so I could support Valve for all they are doing for linux gaming
- And it came with the added bonus of an already gaming optimized Linux install with any easy access to a store front out of the box

For me, the ROG Ally is no different then any high end, expensive gaming PC with Windows, I don't want it. 

I get that it could canibalize the niche that the Deck had carved for itself, and it saddens me that it might lead to Valve to dial back proton support 2-3 years from now if their endevour with the Deck fails, but I have been doing my desktop and exotic emulation gaming on Linux pcs since 2007, and will not change if the Valve Deck brand fails.",SteamDeck
jhxqngy,"The Asus ROG Ally will probably outperform the steamdeck in many ways. But that doesn't mean that it's better than the steamdeck in all ways. 

The biggest reason I would buy the ROG Ally would be the performance and the portable size of it. It looks sleek and good, can play more demanding games, and is quiet. Overall it seems like a very nice system. It runs windows as well making some older games easier to run. I have some games that can only play on windows and my windows partition on my steam deck borked.

The reason I will not buy it is entirely due to it not having touch sensors on the sticks, buttons on the back, and most importantly it does not have trackpads. The trackpads allows me to play a lot of more games comfortably, and it makes already comfortable games with a game pad more easy to control. You can use them as sliders, flick control, mouse, joystick, gyro enabler, buttons, and more. You can even combine these behaviours for even more natural control schemes leading to way better immersion among other benefits. In my honest opinion I can't move away from the steam deck only due to the trackpads. Heck, I play all my games on the pc with my steam deck as a controller because it feels so comfortable.

But moving away from its inferior controls, it's great competition, and that is welcomed any day. I'm overall excited and looking forward to see how this machine will be used and what tools people will build for it, despite me not going to buy it.

If they make a trackpad version with haptic feedback though I'll be really considering buying it or waiting.",SteamDeck
jhxqo4h,Acceptance. Y'all really went through the stages of grief,SteamDeck
jhxqtw5,"For my part, I just feel a little disheartened that the competition in this case is (what seems to be) an excellent hardware platform running an infamously anti-competitive software platform. I wish they had given the choice of SteamOS or Windows, and let users pick. But that might be on Valve and not releasing SteamOS publicly too.",SteamDeck
jhxr47o,"I still have no idea how they're going to sell this thing at a strong enough loss to be competitive with the Steam Deck. 

I use the Deck to play older games like Chrono Cross, Pixel Remasters, and anything up to ps2/gamecube graphics. 

I don't see this device having much more of a cost benefit to me based on my use-case. Most big AAA games I play on my PS5 or the stupidly expensive monitor on my desk.",SteamDeck
jhxrfue,The only reason the sd is better is because quality was sacrificed for price. By making what they made they can  provide a price that people can afford. The Asus has had a history of overpriced hardware. I can see the same being true for this device.,SteamDeck

jhxszht,Oh!  I didn't know about this.  Looks great!  May think about getting this and giving my deck to my daughter.  Looks promising.  Ananeo gives me whiplash with all the versions that they keep coming out with.  Going to do research on the Ally right now!,SteamDeck
jhxt6xy,"Yeah it may be better, but Steam Deck's community support is out of this world.",SteamDeck
jhxtayg,"Being Brutally Honest - I have a hard time installing 'pirated' games on the Steam Deck - they point blank don't work - I've tried installing Lutris and other crap - which has made me hate Linux at times. I'm leaning towards getting a 1tb micro sd for windows dual boot situation just to get around this constant issue.

The point is - this thing has real appeal to me so I'm not blind to it being a better option for me. Looking forward to more news about it.",SteamDeck
jhxtjfp,"I'm not worried. I love my SD, and I love those tactile touch pads on the sides.",SteamDeck
jhxtq7l,"My prediction is it’s going to be priced like any other non SD handheld. That’s the reason the steam deck is so popular, it didn’t really do anything new (from a hardware perspective) but what it did do is make it really affordable. If I’m wrong and asus prices it competitively then by all means. It’s probably not gonna change valves course because valve does what valve does.",SteamDeck
jhxtt5r,"I have my SD but am not completely infatuated like many here. I still primarily use my PC but love the ability to play in bed or on the go. I’m not going to run out and buy an Ally, but seeing more handheld competition in an age where PC components keep getting bigger is exciting.",SteamDeck

jhxv8id,Listen if it's close it price then it's a good competitor but if it's 3 times the price then not really.,SteamDeck
jhxvqg8,"The reason I like the deck is that it's hassle free.   
I mostly play indie games and some older titles on it, the most I've had to do was install ProtonUp to run some ""unsupported"" games.

I do not really like Linux and while SteamOS is actually pretty nice, it's still not as practical as Windows, so I'd rather not have to bother setting up stuff I'm not comfortable with.",SteamDeck
jhxw5me,Let's discuss this after Rog release. Now this is pointless conversation,SteamDeck
jhxwdgt,"I think people forget one of the strongest assets of the Steam Deck is it’s community. The folks that share their troubleshooting solutions, the people making plug-ins, and the openness of the developers. That alone justifies the purchase for me, regardless of wether the ASUS ROG ends up being a competitive handheld (and maybe even a preferable alternative to some use-cases)

If folks want to stay within the Steam ecosystem that is perfectly okay. No need to get all defensive about it, but it is the internet after all.",SteamDeck
jhxwe68,I'm just waiting for the steam deck 2 to come and kick everyone's ass again,SteamDeck
jhxwt6f,"My main concern is the Ally shipping with Windows, not with the device itself.  The Steam Deck is the Trojan Horse of Linux gaming.  It's a mass market device with a nice UI that gets a lot of console and PC gamers onto Linux that would not be using Linux otherwise.  I know Valve is selling them practically at cost, so if another device takes the spotlight Valve will still be fine.  However, the Steam Deck is the single biggest thing driving up the Linux numbers and if we want Linux to succeed as a gaming OS (and with the rate Microsoft is shittifying Windows 11 I think we absolutely need it to) then we need the Deck or other machines shipping SteamOS.

I kinda want to buy an Ally for OpenRGB development purposes and to run SteamOS on it.  The hardware looks great.  The software looks terrible.",SteamDeck
jhxxcee,"Doesn't the Ally run Windows? 

I can't speak for anyone else, but the pair of Decks I bought weren't to have the most powerful gaming devices; I have a pair of high-end gaming PCs for that. Purchasing the Decks was about putting my money where my mouth is regarding supporting gaming on Linux (or, really, just getting the industry moving away from Windows). 

In top of that, I constantly see people talking about ""Steam Deck killers"" which don't have what I consider to be the most identifying features of the SD, being the touch pads, additional back buttons, and ability to seamlessly map controls to everything from physical buttons to virtual menus. 

Without these things, all of these handhelds fail to even enter the arena with Valve and the SD in a meaningful way. Obviously performance per dollar can put pressure on Valve, and sure, some people won't care it runs Windows or has limited control options, but ultimately, this constant and drastic ""missing the point"" relegated these devices to Switch killers much more than long-term competition for Valve. 

Obviously success on any scale can allow for future revisions that more closely align with Valve's target audience, but even then, many people seem to overlook the colossal moat that Valve has in the form of first-party integration with the largest games distribution that's ever likely to exist. 

Relax. There will always be better performing handhelds; that doesn't invalidate your purchase any more than other people having faster cars than you. The Deck hits a market, and it does so so successfully that none of the ""killers"" even attempt to encroach on the featureset. 

Competition is healthy and ultimately good for consumers. Valve will be watching closely as to how more performant competitions affect their bottom line and will adapt accordingly. My guess, though, is that any of these competitors will remain rounding errors to Valve until we cross the threshold of AIO desktop replacements where controls and featuresets are offset by customizability of external peripherals and software.",SteamDeck
jhxxdtb,"People will still get many of their games on the ally via steam. Valve still wins either way.

I think the steam deck has some incredible software behind it that puts it above other handhelds, even ones with more power.",SteamDeck
jhxxlae,"It will have some crossover, but like the Switch have its own audience for the most part based on price point. Anything over £500 will price a lot of people out without some other exclusive reason to own the device. 

What the Steamdeck has is the name Valve behind it and the word steam in the title. The big draw is taking your Steam Library on the move and while other, newer devices will have the same capability without the number one point being front and centre it will struggler without another standout key feature. 

Don't forget - there has been a been a big handheld on the market for years with the Switch and it's not really in competition with the SD",SteamDeck
jhxy8vs,"The price is really where it competes. Nobody is going to buy the ally if it's 2× the PS5. If I wanted to spend 800+ on something to play games on, I would have much higher standards that the steam deck wouldn't be able to meet.",SteamDeck
jhxyn2a,Evolving and competition is a win for gamers in general... We all win... The Steam Deck is literally the first handheld that has captivated me and coaxed me into purchasing since the original Gameboy... This system gets everything right on so many different facets... Valve and the steam community should wear this as a badge of honor as this system legitimately has paved the way to future handheld success. They got this right...I enjoy the hell out of this capable system and its community is second to none...,SteamDeck

jhy0to7,"The problem with me and the new Asus ROG Ally is that the price it would be more than a ps5 pro console, I am estimating to see a $600 device with a 256GB just because it has RGB and ROG brand.

There is no price announcement, and I don't expect this thing to be cheap. I am happy with an SD 32Gb upgrade it with a 1TB m2 2230 memory and a 512gb micro SD card.

4. Gaben and Phil Spencer are old friends so we are expecting XBOX integration (GamePass on Steam?) and standalone windows distro which already announced.

If SD can get native GPU without doing partition and make it easier to install I would reup my subscription,SteamDeck
jhy2u04,"Well, nobody likes to feel their investment somehow is not perfect. I mean it is unrealistic, but people are like this. 
I certainly welcome this as the more actors in the handheld market appears the better the products will be. Because of trying to constantly improve upon what the competition is currently offering. 

For instance, do we need RGB? Well, it doesn't make it less cooler or be faster and or have better battery performance. But I love the detail and it's something I value. Same with the touchpads, I won't miss them, but like before, I'm sure someone does value the SD touchpads.

It's cool this is being made, and I've been really interested in handheld PCs years before the steam deck, but there's a reason the deck was the first I actually bought. If it's a competitive price then great, but if not I don't really see this eating into steam deck sales",SteamDeck
jhy6371,Why does this even need to be said.,SteamDeck
jhy6tjc,I would hate to use desktop mode on the ally simple because it lacks trackpads. And steamOS is great. It's still competitive as a handheld since the price looks to be $700+ for the ally so it's in the same zone as very decent gaming laptops.,SteamDeck
jhy73r4,It might be good but valve actually supports their system. The only thing that could even help Asus complete is to put in as much work on updates and constantly improving the experience. If they just drop it and don't actually have any support long term they won't do near as well as the deck.,SteamDeck

jhy7e89,I got a mid range hand-held pc that runs every game I play perfectly for $400. 4 years ago I got a low end gpu for $500 that I could only use sitting at my desk. The Ally will probably be the best for AAA games but the SD is perfect for regular gamers.,SteamDeck
jhy7h7u,"I love steam os and how it functions and the deck itself. However, I also knew it was entry level for handheld pcs. For the price compared to the specs, it is well worth having for several years. Just pushing it to see what the SD is capable of running is fun, let alone playing the games. 

I do, however, know that eventually, I will have to get a new handheld. Unless the ROG Ally is comparable in price, I'm likely going to wait a few more years. Especially since AMD is just now coming out with an APU that's specifically designed for handheld pcs. 

Since Asus is primarily a hardware manufacturer, there's likely no benefit for them to lower the price as much as Valve did for the steam deck. Valve could at least make massive game sales due to the influx of deck users who otherwise wouldn't have bought games on steam. 

Unless GOG or one of the other game marketplaces make their own handheld, the other handhelds that likely come out will be far more expensive than the deck. So, I will wait for something that is truly powerful, yet manages to keep a 3 hour battery life, even if it is $1000, I will make sure it's worth that price. 

The GPD win 4 is on the right track, but I'll likely wait for their win 5 iteration. The win 4 so far has shown lacking battery life.",SteamDeck
jhy7nav,"Asus Rog ally is going to be atleast double the price if not more so I hope that it's better!

jhyqv9b,"Handhelds aren't about raw power. Portability and catalogue is what matters. When did you last see a Nintendo that boasted ""the most powerful hardware on the market""? If the ROG can beat the Steam Deck as a handheld, pricing and games compatibility - yes, it will be a major player, still leading an uphill battle because of being late on the market of handheld PCs. It may end up selling more than the Steam Deck in the long run, but either way the winner revenue-wise will be Valve. Asus makes money through hardware sales. Valve's strategy is much more nuanced - they are actively working towards creating a new market niche where they can sell software. It's like American football vs actual football (soccer). Yes, American football players (in that analogy Asus ROG) may have bigger muscles, and they may have a following in a specific niche, but Soccer is making big money worldwide.",SteamDeck

I've not really hit a hard limit to what I can play/stream with the Steam Deck. But if the Ally is a decent price and I want to play more AAA games locally, then I may just pick one up.

As much as I love Valve (I signed up for Steam in 2003), I'm not married to them, and as great as the Steam Deck is, the distribution network is... not great. ESPECIALLY outside of the US, where I am (non-EU Europe), getting one was super hard, or super expensive, or both.

So with Asus distribution network, they have a good chance of growing the market and give Valve a run for their money.

Valve doesn't sell Steam Decks, they sell games. They give you a game store and an entry-level device. That's it. It is up to others to push the limit.

The ROG is going to be better than Steamdeck you say? Great. Gabe will sell some AAA games for it.

Every another Steam-based console will spill gold on Valve.

Valve doesn't need to compete with top hardware manufacturers and they won't do it. Every gamer should clearly understand the simple fact: over years, there will be more and more steamdeck-ish stuff, and all of it will overcome the original SD at every parameter. Very soon it will be too boring to start another topic on Reddit once another new console gets released.

You say, something delivers more FPS than the SD?

Yup cool.

But stop comparing please. There's no point. We don't bury our heads in the sand. We just accept the inevitable impossibility to buy all the hi-end on this planet.

All in all I would be happy if there was some sort of community SteamOS port for the thing.

So the prices of the 6800u handheld range from 800-1300 I guess they could get away with anywhere between 1300 - 1500 I don't think I'll be giving up my steam deck anytime soon until we can get close to 2060 levels of performance on handheld,SteamDeck
jhz8zwx,"I mean yeah, there's a lot of ways the Ally could be better. Except for price. Steam is taking a loss on these units, but they'll make it back with software bought. Asus doesn't have that luxury. I'd be shocked if it's under 1200.",SteamDeck

I still think the Steam Deck, with the trackpads, and Steam Input and such has the hardcore audience that likes to tinker around. Ally seems more tailored to ""high-end gaming"" vs the Steam Deck's all-around approach. I think the Ally will drain battery too fast for lower-end games, but it'll also be good for those who want to play AAA games or for those who are more comfortable with Windows. From what I've seen so far, that's my take. I hope the price doesn't disappoint.",SteamDeck

We can’t realistically expect the SD to stay on top forever. It’s basically a PC… and this has always been the problem with PC gaming vs console gaming. PCs are constantly being updated, it’s a much more dynamic ecosystem. 

Heck, when the SD 2 gets released, which could happen anytime, the SD won’t be the top dog anymore.

There’s absolutely no reason to expect the SD to be the best and greatest…

Only 2 rear buttons, no trackpads, and unknown level of support for control mapping mean that I wouldn't even consider this over the Steam Deck, regardless of how much more powerful it might be. Even with the Deck, I am still finding myself wishing for a couple more buttons on the back just to really fine tune my control scheme.

ji076pn,I highly doubt the ROG Ally will even come close to a competitive price with the steam deck considering ROG probably won’t be selling at a loss like Valve.

SteamDeck running the same game native at med high settings =40 frames pulling less than half the power. You can’t have your cake and eat it too with the ROG. More resolution means it needs more graphic processing power to do the same work. They have straight up said you can’t utilize the 140hz refresh rate with the graphics card that is in the Ally. The whole rig is setup for you to use their proprietary enclosure with an external gpu.

No trackpads, back buttons, no SD card and smaller frame. It’s the kinda device that could gain by losing some features. I love my trackpads for certain games, but I’d happily buy an SD light for just something nicer to hold and look at.

However wait till the ASUs reviews. Yes it’s running windows but SD is a console experience I’d say.

The problem is, Asus is a hardware manufacturer while Valve owns a game distribution platform. If both are required to make hardware revenue out of software, Valve would take the lead. Just like how consoles can be sold cheap and also recoup the loss through game sales. With no platform, Asus would need to try a lot harder to compete with Valve. This includes going down the route of artificially limiting the stock to keep loss low, and open the flood gate once the hardware became obsolete enough.

ji2a9xz,"I was just watching some vids, there is a price for the high end model of $699.

I'm not sure I would say that's definite until either the manufacturer says so or you can actually buy it, but it's at least a ballpark number.

I would still rather have the steamdeck. First, the cheap model of the deck is lower (though, admittedly, we dont know the price point of the low end model). Second, there's no trackpads. 

Third, 90% of the reason I bought a Steamdeck was that I'm getting sick of Windows and MS' bullshit. I was curious how well I could keep gaming if I changed OS'. Well, it exceeded my expectations by a long shot. 

I'd like to put SteamOS on my desktop PC or possibly have an external GPU for other games and to extend the lifetime of the deck (in which case I would just use my deck for everything).

I know a lot of folks on here ""dont need"" raytracing or 4k 400hz resolution. I dont either, but I want tech like that; it's part of who I am. I also want to upgrade rather than replace an entire system, so I think it'll be hard to get rid of owning a desktop. But maybe. The easy path to that is an external GPU.",SteamDeck

This is a major Sream Deck weakness at the moment. 

The ability of being able to play Fornite, Destiny 2, COD, GTA online,  or other popular online games on the go with no issues is extremely valuable in and of itself.  This feature can be the deciding factor for people deciding between the Ally and the Deck.

jhx22pt,This isn't necessarily true. The big reason Valve made a push themselves into making their own handheld hardware was to increase market share of Linux gaming. Valve put a lot of R&D money into Proton to ensure gaming on Linux was viable.

jhytp5g,Yeah like you can try to sell me a super PC in the size of the switch but with no trackpads I'll skip out. Tons of games I play on the deck would not be possible if I didn't have the track pads. Imo not having them really soft locks the games you'll be able to play,SteamDeck
jhy5h0r,"Yeah. I don't use them much but they're essential for some games. Same with the back buttons, though like 90% of the time I just rebind L3 and R3 to them so having 2 instead of 4 might be okay. Dual action triggers though, that'd be nice.

I have two decks, one with steam OS and one with Windows. This idea that Linux gamers have that windows is just this power hungry OS that itself will eat battery is just paranoia. I play the same games on both. Games that get shit battery life (90-120 minutes) do so on both Steam OS and Windows. Games that get better battery get around the same on both OS’s. 


Performance is 99% the same, with windows getting the lead on non-steam games. In my experience running non steam games on Steam OS using heroic, Lutris, or even installing as a non steam app, leads to worse performance vs native steam titles sometimes. This is a non issue on windows. Windows also has more games due to not relying on proton compatibility and having support in anti cheat based multiplayer games. 


“You might download something funny and brick the OS”, again, over exaggerating. This is possible on Steam OS too, and if anything you’ll be tinkering more with OS level stuff using Konsole for things like installing themes, installing basic apps not found in discovery store, etc. acting like windows is so complicated that the average joe is gonna be bricking their OS and wanting refunds is just massive cope.",SteamDeck

jhydp1a,"Fair comment.  I would reply that that insofar as game developers are developing specifically for handhelds anyway, they're not going to be targeting the top few percent of what is already a comparatively niche market.  The Steam Deck has an installed customer base that will, as a matter of practicality, greatly exceed that of the new gen handhelds.  

To put it in perspective, while this week a lot of us have been *talking* about the Ally, Valve will have *sold* another \~20,000 - 40,000 Steam Decks (assuming \~1-2M a year; pick other numbers if you prefer).  I frankly think it will be quite a while before Asus even stops the gap growing, let alone starts to catch up.

ji0l4vg,That's true but game developers won't really target either the steam deck or ally for performance.,SteamDeck
jhyfbef,"Well the whole point of it being the *Steam* Deck is that it's made to access Steam, which specifically exists to keep on supporting games long after they would normally be abandoned.  That's one of the big reasons for the Deck's success:  extremely easy access to vast library of older, indie and other less demanding games that will run well on lighter hardware.

So Valve will probably want to add another layer for the verification flags.  Anything which is verified or playable for the Mk1 Deck will *ipso facto* be verified or playable for the Mk2.  

So Valve could just add a nice shiny number to the flag icon, showing the lowest model number that it applies to.  If you see a ""Playable (**2**)"" then you know it needs at least a SteamDeck 2 to be playable.  IDK, something like that?

Anyway, I agree with your base point - a 3-4y or so refresh cycle sounds about right given the pace of development - that's about 2 CPU generations and maybe 1-2 GPU generations.  And it's probably going to fit well with the expected median lifespan of the Deck.",SteamDeck

I also don't get the problems some people seem to be having with SteamOS. It's still a work in progress, but in comparison, Windows sucks ass nowadays and Microsoft made sure to move away from a consumer friendly OS years ago.

The Steam Deck is a single player beast. My son plays multiplayer with his but only docked. The kind of games that are blocked due to anti cheat are the games least suited to handheld in my opinion.

Obviously it depends what you are into but there are a lot of games that require a track pad. I bought an indie early access game earlier this week, Shadows of Doubt. It's great and it has controller support and the controller support works for 80% of what you do and for the other 20% it is *so* frustrating until you switch to a mixture of controller and trackpad.

That's a couple of clicks and can be done in game on the Deck. If I only owned an Ally I probably wouldn't have risked it or I would have risked it and wasted my money and time.

&#x200B;

BUT... Team Fortress 2 is what made the path for what Diablo IV and other games are today. And Counter-Strike: GO only made it 10x worse, plus introduced literal gambling on Twitch. They are a business and it is about money.

&#x200B;

That said, they seem to be a business that helps innovate and is OK with being the first then handing the reins over while also getting tons of money in the process--and that is why I like them. Yes, they'll make money from it. But also by sharing tech, they help create other standards. Just like how they made mega bank for Steam and honestly got so much hate at first when they launched Steam (I remember raging myself when CS became only available on Steam), when they opened it up to indies and anyone rather than just a select few games from AAA's (and themselves), they made the way for indies and such such as Stardew to get a massive platform and become legends. They built so many careers and studios.

SteamDeck is likely that. A way to penetrate the market the Switch has, bring PCs into handheld, and create a whole audience they were missing... and I wouldn't be shocked if in a few years SteamDeck is like CS:GO--just one of many, even if a damn good and popular one.

jhyceiq,"I will say, that while you're correct, Valve's lootbox economy has always been FAR more consumer friendly than most alternatives. In almost all of their games (outside of TF2 and, I suppose, Artifact) the only things you can get through boxes are cosmetic. There's no gameplay advantages through them, and no pay-to-win mechanics. A lot of other games miss this part of it, and come across as much more greedy by pressuring players to buy boxes, rather than encouraging them because they want to support a product.

Case in point for me is Dota vs League of Legends. I have over a thousand hours in both, but LoL restricts so much gameplay content (champions and previously runes) behind pay or time walls. Dota is balanced around the fact that every hero is available to everyone, and your knowledge/ability is what limits your draft choices, not what characters you have unlocked. I usually spent money in LoL because I HAD to, to unlock a character I was interested in, rather than just wanting a cool cosmetic in Dota and feeling good about my purchase.

I think that Valve, while wanting to make money (of course they do), keeps in mind that goodwill and faith in them not screwing over the customer (not saying that doesn't happen from time to time) earns them a lot more in the long run than trying to nickle and dime customers for a short gain, EA style.",SteamDeck

Microsoft is renting you the license. I think this is a more honest portrayal of your ownership of the game - you don't own anything with GamePass, but everyone is aware of what's going on.

With game ""ownership"" there is this song and dance where the customer thinks they're buying a game, but the seller thinks they're selling a license.

My preferred approach is to rent games via GamePass until they become available on GOG, at which point I can download the actual game files to my computer so even if the terms of the license change, nobody can enforce that upon me.

I try not to ""buy"" from Steam unless there are no other viable alternatives, and when buying from Steam I am resigned to the fact that it's more like a long-term rental.",SteamDeck

I don't really condone PC game piracy anymore because Steam does a good job, but if Steam went away the option at least still exists (in contrast to cloud gaming like Stadia which is the worst of the worst, you own absolutely nothing not even files on your hard drive).

Oddly changing the settings to Medium and High also seem to hit 20 fps, which makes no sense. So at its current state, people should absolutely avoid this on Steam Deck. Turning the camera also tanks everything immediately to a cluttery mess.

ji46kuw,"So I spent some time with it this morning and it's a weird one to be sure. No matter what your settings are, it hovers around 20fps on steam deck. This is whether settings are all set to low, or all set to epic. FSR also doesn't seem to make any difference for performance.

In doing some reading, it seems like there's an issue with native resolution settings. When you set it on the low graphic preset with FSR off, it's making a hidden change to half the output resolution. Looks terrible. However, if you change to the epic preset, then manually change all the rest of the settings back to low, it seems like it's maybe actually outputting 800p. However, there's still no change to FPS.

I even tried toggling the ray tracing button, and no change either.

Based on what's possible on steam deck with epic settings all on, I would actually  expect that it's actually within the realm of possibility for decent playability on medium to low, once they get the kinks worked out

However, it seems like there are still massive graphical issues when outputting at 800p. The textures look all wrong, super jaggedy in some areas and blurry in others. I'm not very technically minded, but even though the display option is available in the resolution settings, it's like they didn't actually intend to support play at this lower resolution. It's really rough, even when it seems like it should be very possible. Pretty borked at the moment.

And it seems like I'm general, the game just isn't optimised for 800p play. I would have expected",SteamDeck

Oddly changing the settings to Medium and High also seem to hit 20 fps, which makes no sense. So at its current state, people should absolutely avoid this on Steam Deck.

My setup is nothing special, I have not touched immutable FS or installed anything that could interfere, I believe. I had decky but it was the first thing I uninstalled to test. 

The problem is that the gaming mode is too dark too, but can be remediated with brightness slider (gamma here is OK, it seems). 

Not sure, if the brightness slider values have changed, but I feel like once I achieve similar visibility as it was before, the leds are too bright (still doesn't *feel* right).  

In desktop mode the gamma is set to 1 (which is too dark), the brightness level carries over but doesn't help. I set gamma to 2.35 and it's ok, but doesn't fix the problem in gaming mode. If I go back to desktop mode, the gamma would be wrong again: it's set to 2.35 and it's too much (the colors are washed out), so if I set it back to 1 it looks right again. I go to GM and back to DM and the gamma set to 1 is too dark. 

If there is any other way I could help to troubleshoot it, send logs, open an issue, please let me know.

jhyyyd4,"I mentioned it recently in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12t2rpr/enough_positivity_whats_the_worst_thing_about_the/), but the large size and bulkiness is one of the main downsides of the Steam Deck to me, but I'm a 5'0"" woman with small hands. Even though I'd seen a bunch of videos before ordering I was still kinda shocked by how big it was when it arrived, lol. It's mostly comfortable when I'm playing at home (except occasionally when I hold it in a bad position and get cramps/stiff arms), but recently I took it on holiday and didn't want to use it at all in my cramped plane seat and just read a book instead. Honestly it doesn't feel super portable to me in the sense that I can't see myself using it other than at home or maybe as a car passenger (which I haven't tried yet), but then again the last portable I owned was a Game Boy Advance as a kid so it's a pretty different experience lol.

I'm unlikely to get the Asus Rog Ally anyway just because I already have a Steam Deck now, but if I hadn't bought one the smaller size and weight would definitely be a big plus point in its favour. I'm unsure about the ergonomics though, I agree with you that it looks a bit flat but we'll probably have to wait for user reviews to know more.",SteamDeck

* Large size for my big monster hands
* 4 rear paddles (and yes, I use all four of them)
* Trackpads (Amiga emulation these pads are invaluable) - imagine controlling the mouse on that Asus with an analog stick for a minute.
* No Windows (yes, that is a feature to me)

Don't get me wrong, it's usable for me, and I think the size is a worthwhile compromise in order to fit trackpads, but I don't find it as comfortable as either my Switch or my 2021 Ayaneo.

If they made a proportionally shrunk Steam Deck (same shape, same inputs, same screen resolution, just everything shrunk by maybe 15-20% or so) at more or less the same performance and battery life I'd be sorely tempted to replace my Deck with that.",SteamDeck

jhz7jti,Good ergonomics should be one of the main defining features of a device you will be holding and using for long periods of time. All the power in the world won't make up for hand cramping and the annoyance of feeling like poor button placement is slowing you down in games.,SteamDeck

jhznxu8,"The ergonomics are pretty good, I would agree. But the Deck is undoubtedly on the big and heavy side, and as a result most of the time I'm just playing with it docked or otherwise just sitting on a stand.

Beyond that, it’s very comfortable in the hands.",SteamDeck

Also OP should invest in some better joycons or any of the many grips that make the switch beareable. I guess I'm in the center where NEITHER of the devices are ergonomic, without help.

ji08xbw,"I've been playing on my Steam Deck ever since I got it four months ago, and picking up my Switch to update my games gave me such whiplash because it was just so... light!

It's definitely easier to carry around and chuck into bags, but I much prefer the library of the Deck. Plus, I can't imagine comfortably playing shooters for a long time on the Switch. Deck is built for that.",SteamDeck

I don't care whether the sticks are above or below the d-pad / face buttons, but they should definitely be in line with each other.",SteamDeck
ji2gagp,"Yea I only keep index fingers on the shoulder buttons, typically. I guess my fingers are long enough that to press the back buttons, my middle and ring fingers have to squeeze and arch a bit, so I have to briefly readjust how I support the device overall. If that describes it.  

But that is a pretty neat idea, forgoing the shoulder buttons altogether. Ill try that grip out.",SteamDeck
ji2soyu,Yeah the joy con controllers was not pleasant and I switched out for the pro controller when playing on a TV,SteamDeck
ji6nc20,"Ah I'm saying silicone but it's more like a harder plastic - I grabbed [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B2WKR11L/ref=twister_B0B125NHB7?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon and there's no dust/grime collection whatsoever (and I am somewhat lazy with housekeeping so there's plenty to pick up, too!). If you do go for it the easiest way to put the Deck in it is top first - putting the buttons through the case and then pushing in the bottom. If you play docked with the official dock this does prevent the USB-C from being able to push in thanks to the design, but I solved this by getting a short USB-C female-to-male cable that works a treat. 

For the thumb grips I searched for Switch as the PS/Xbox ones are just slightly too big, and ended up with [these](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1355122065/rawr-thumb-grips-for-nintendo-switch?transaction_id=3415013697) from Etsy.

I’ve not heard something this wrong in a good while regarding denuvo, please do your research

The switch is a portable machine - steam deck also portable machine - 

PCs struggle with denuvo checks - the switch could not physically do them full stop. Whilst the steam deck can manage them the switch runs on a tegra chipset using a ARM architecture, it’s easily exploited through RCM exploits by bridging the 10th and 9th pins where CFW can ‘spoof’ packages opposed to that of which denuvo would check for on the software level with ‘triggers’ and licences. These licences on the switch we don’t even know how they are generated hence why many are banned from online entirely. Needless to say the modern pc architecture struggles with this let alone a tegra chip or mobile processor.

Emulation isn’t even a factor here in this debate, I don’t even know what you’re trying to say. As for the switch 2 using denuvo, while it’s possible it would also have to move to a completely separate way of operation. Or iridico writing denuvo DRM from the way up.",SteamDeck

Still Life (I play it on xemu), do yourself a favor and play this game.

Broken Sword 1 (play the original on scummvm on steamdeck, remakes extra scenes and portraits suckorz. If you buy the remake on steam you get the original as an optional download afair. On gog for sure.)

Syberia

Also this
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1410640/Syberia_The_World_Before/

But Syberia is better. I replay it on xemu as well, but it requires a commandline fix (swap to experimental renderer) to work (otherwise immense slowdown after the first puzzle), so you are better off trying the PC version if you just want to try it.

Also dont play Telltale Games while still trying to find gems of the genre. They mostly are very, very average.

jhxsvj5,"I think we are seeing 3 things happen.

1.	We are starting to move on from last gen.  Which means a huge jump in cpu power and vram requirements.  We have been spoiled by the last gen consoles holding back cpu use.  Pretty much anything newer than a 6th gen Intel didn’t have much of a problem.  Now that consoles leaped in cpu power, we won’t see low cpu requirements anymore.


To explain the cpu side more, the increase likely comes from a few things.  Wildly more draw calls because geometric density increases.  Streaming in assets uses a lot of cpu.  And also introduces a lot of other new issues.  And RT adds a heavy cpu toll due to the bvh structure.

Funny enough UE5 should fix a lot of the cpu issues as it introduces direct storage support, new world partition streaming, nanite, and better multi threaded support. 

2.	People are pushing UE harder and don’t know how to optimize it well.  UE is super powerful and can do great things, but it really requires a large and talented team to optimize it well.  There are only a handful of studios that have shown competence in this so far.  A great example of this is looking at borderlands 3 from launch to now and then tiny Tina which when pretty solid technically if a little underwhelming.  It took them like 5 years to figure out ue4.  After the game came out…

3.	Devs have less time to polish and games are rushed out way earlier than they should be.  WAY EARLIER

I think time will fix #2 a bit as more of the industry moves to UE but it could likely get worse for a while as everyone tries to wrangle ue5…",SteamDeck

There is also just an awkward reality in which a crappy RTX 2000 series, followed by a crypto boom destroyed 3000 series, and a crazy expensive 4000 means a lot of PC gamers that might have done a new build in the last 5 years or so haven't, so the random ""gaming"" PC is probably a tad older and less powerful vs a nice new box then is historically normal.",SteamDeck

I would point out that spec wise we have been lagging for about two years, mostly down to cpu/gpu shortages/components due to covid. It would appear the tech lag has caught up with us at last. I am actually surprised that people are reacting this way. I mean we all knew it would catch up hardware wise eventually.

A more likely approach would be to design and 3D print a more GPD-like chassis for a used Deck, like how Framework has enabled for their laptop users.

i5 8th + 1050 is very serviceable, esp. if it's functioning. Why not set up a media server? Or set up HoloISO, or any Linux distro. I bet with FSR and less overhead it can match the performance of the Deck.

ji6ddfo,"DIY Perks, is that you?

I think this is a cool idea for a ""We do what we must because we can"" project, and I wish you luck.

The ~~haters~~ other commenters all have valid criticisms--there are few if any practical benefits of using the Deck's mainboard as opposed to any laptop mobo (and explicitly the one from Framework), but the two that come to mind are:

- size: though you should consider extending your search to used/broken devices from Ayaneo, GPD, OneX and UDOO. There are also NUCs and other ultra-SFF mainboard might suit your form factor
- efficiency: where the Deck, as I understand it, remains completely unmatched, even in comparison to newer chips like the Rembrandt-series 6800U and now the Phoenix and Dragon Range series, is **low-end** performance--talking about the ROG Ally, ThePhawx was recently throwing around a graph showing that Aerith/Vangogh continues to punch above its weight at 3W and 5W TDPs

Now the things to caution you about that others may not have brought up:

- If you find you need to install additional drivers or software packages to get the rest of the laptop to work--or even just control ""suspend on lid close,"" then **SteamOS and its immutable filesystem are going to be giant headaches**
- But on the flip-side, if you _don't_ use SteamOS, it's a lot of effort to cobble together all the optimizations that make the Steam Deck great (not just the custom kernel--as you can now use the mainline kernel and [a quick patch](https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-ucm-conf/commit/6dd80aee34dbff85de5818b9181bb382dfe868ec)), but the TDP/clock/fps limiters you can slide up and down from that side menu.

Anyway, again, best of luck. And pay no attention to the people acting like doing creative things with Deck hardware is some sort of desecration.",SteamDeck

But now the Decks mainboard is here...even smaller and cheaper. I appreciate your technical know-how but its just not worth it, the deck isn't powerful enough to play AA 1080p games on a ""big"" laptop display, you will just build a bigger deck without the controller, paddles and touchpads. You just better take a used gaming laptop with a gtx1060 or something like that...but it will not solve the e-waste problem. That's the problem, you could grab a mainboard (new e-waste) and build it inside your old laptop enclosure, but you will need to buy more and more electrical stuff like usb-hub, maybe display controller board, several adapters and so on. It will look AND perform like a DIY solution and you definitely don't want it for a price of a used gaming laptop :)
I really understand you and i am the same kind of person, building everything and upgrading everything i can myself, it's my hobby, my passion...but sometimes you just need to let the idea go.

So, if the battery or screen of the steam deck is bad, he still has use for it. If either of those are still fine, he can use it, as well as the casing, as replacement parts for his current Steam Deck.

I've had too many problems with OBS on Windows. Never liked it as a result and avoid it whenever possible. Screen Recorder 4 by Cyberlink works much better for me on Windows if I'm not using the Windows 11 screen capture. But the best alternative when it's all said and done is a capture card. The Steam Deck can be connected to a capture card with USB C to HDMI adapter and then connect the capture card to a PC using a USB 3 port. The screen on the Steam Deck will go black but that's a good thing. It means the A/V signal is being pushed to the PC. If you open up OBS, Screen Recorder 4 or any software that will accept that feed then the Steam Deck's video output will show up on the PC screen.

The Steam Deck is still active even though the screen is off so you could still use the controls on the Deck but you'd have to watch the computer screen. Technically you could record this way but there is an increase in latency. Ideally you'd want to have the connected PC to record your footage via the capture card, but go HDMI out of the capture card into a separate monitor so there's no increase in latency when you're playing games while looking at the monitor.

jhuravb,"I know CEMU version is better, but this eliminates the need for that (which i guess most guys keep for BOTW). Moreover, minimal config, no mods like FPS++ needed (although CEMU has great graphic packs). So for a vanilla experience and keeping everything on Yuzu its a great option. Not to mention that the upcoming TOTK will hopefully run great too.  


**My config**

* Yuzu Early Access v3531 (Have to sign up for the Yuzu Patreon)
* 64 GB Steam Deck 
* Emudeck 2.1
* Cryoutilities 2.0 (with 4GB VRAM setting in BIOS)

jhvspgp,News surrounding the overall performance from the last play test on TotK shows that it often during combat hits low fps on the switch. Skill up said it was definitely near or below the 15FPS mark so this really does worry me not only for the game itself but on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhv9uh0,Does the frame rate stay at 30 in the forest where you find the master sword as well? It's the area where the Switch struggles the most and has big drops in fps,SteamDeck

jhvs0nn,"TOTK will be my last physical purchase for the Switch for my Nintendo collection but if it’s true and will run great on the deck I’d prefer to play it on the deck. Simply because it’s so much comfortable to hold, and I don‘t want to spend more than the game itself on similar grips for the switch. But only if it’s true and would run 100% flawlessly.",SteamDeck
jhws4yg,"So i've been playing BOTW on my steam deck for about two weeks now, just finished off ruta and going on to the second divine beast with about 2 dozen shrines completed.  I installed with emudeck.  For anyone wondering why yuzu over cemu, I own an original switch and can dump my own roms.  Never had a WII U and have no interest in picking one up at this point.  


YUZU runs great.  The beginning was a little rough with the shader compilation but after a few minutes it was barely noticeable.  Occasionally when I encounter something new I get a frame drop for a few seconds while shader compile but 95% of the time it's not a problem.  Even with turning down the TDP, etc I still get a locked 30 FPS. 

For a while I used steam input to map the gyro to the right stick.  It worked well but I couldn't control some of the shrines.  Emudeck has the GyroDSU option that works great (be sure to reboot).

Biggest issue is that after a ""long sleep"" the Steam deck wakes up and applies the default Mouse/Keyboard bindings until I open and close the steam menu. Additional issues came when I tried to install the second wind mod.  After working through the windows install instructions on linux yuzu would just segfault.  Turns out yuzu was running into a max open file limit.  After fixing that it booted, but yuzu crashed when I got near enemies.  Oh well.",SteamDeck

jhuvil0,"Hey its not sad or anything. There would be 2 easy ways but I would advise installing Emudeck first as it will make it easier. There are already many guides for it.

1) Emudeck latest version just got an option to setup early access, enter the patreon early access token here, and it will update the version to early access.

2) Alternatively if you have the Yuzu Appimage, just go to Home/Applications and replace the existing yuzi.AppImage with your new one.

Hope that helps.

 Nintendo refuses to innovate unless it's on their console, and their consoles are notoriously under powered ever since the GameCube.

I said $70 is a hard sell on an old console, do you think it's right to up the price from the standard $60 when you aren't offering a modern experience like 60fps and 4k?  I'm currently playing botw at 3440x1440p at 60fps.  Probably could push it to over 100.  The graphics are vastly improved.

I'm sure you've heard this before, but copyright protection isn't theft. We actually just got further evidence the other day that lobbyists have been burying the fact that they have no evidence that piracy hurt their sales. 

Additionally I don't give a shit about 'stealing' from a shitty corporation. Everyone who made the game got paid so I'm not going to weep for a company that sells 10 year old Android tablets at a profit. I don't pirate games where the people who did the work get the profits, but screw giving some boardmembers money.

>you might as well just steal the switch from a store and hack it

I had a Switch before it was the Switch, it was called the Shield Tablet, and it was way better than the Switch is now, over 10 years later. Why would I want to own a crappy locked-down version of that? Just to play games I can play for free? No thanks. 

>it’s not expensive enough that they’re going to prosecute you.

I was being respectful until this. This is the stupidest thing I've read today.

> You can have all the games for free and not pay a penny to any predatory corporation except for valve

I already have all the games for free, and I had them for free before I ever got a Deck. In terms of being predatory, Valve sells powerful mobile hardware at a loss, developed Proton and SteamOS which they distribute for free, is a far superior environment for purchasing games, and does really basic shit like let their device have a web browser. Nintendo sells weak shitty hardware at a mark-up, developed nothing of value to anyone (literally everything about the Switch is shit other than its ability to play Nintendo titles), distribute nothing for free, and viciously overcharge for games.",SteamDeck

Yuzu already performs well on a PC and I’ve been able to run BoTW at 4k since 2020 if I remember correctly. And the last time I checked I was able to get to 60fps with some tinkering (cant remember if it was the 60fps mod, or switching from Vulkan to opengl or vice versa).

Switch hardware is 7 year old at this point and most modern games are going to run BETTER on yuzu islf you have the hardware to support it. Xenonlade 3 for example runs at 60fps on a PC with Yuzu vs 30 something fps on a switch.

Now these are facts, so I’d like to hear some counter arguments with facts if possible. Just saying “official hardware is gonna do it better” is not gonna cut it. Especially, since the official hardware is 7 years old.

ji38npx,"It ""can"" be stored on an SD card, but this might hurt performance depending on the specific game. I know God of War got really gnarly with stutters after doing it, for instance.

With the next big update the shader cache should be shrinking by 50-60%, but this is still a case of putting off the issue if you're on a 64gb Deck, IMO.

ji2bpc0,"> when you had to wait until your action (clicking, opening the Windows Explorer and so on)

I haven't had anything like that. I still have some memories of using Windows 98, so I have some familiarity. The OS seems fine to me for the most part, though I never used the 64 GB chip that came with my Steam Deck at all for comparison. I swapped it out with the SYONCON before turning it on.

I haven't benchmarked it or anything, but still no speed issues. I don't think I've transferred anything directly to it from another drive. Pretty much everything on the SSD was downloaded from online. I have 1000Mb/s internet which is around 125MB/s, so that's about the highest I could download anyway. Wifi is closer to 600Mb/s on my network which is 75MB/s, so your referenced 80MB/s would be faster than any download transfer speed I'd be able to maintain anyway.

No issues with slowdowns in games at all or slow loading times.

Without benchmarking, I'm not sure what to say. Maybe yours is a lemon? I can't tell you anything for sure without having benchmarked mine. There are people who have benchmarked and posted screenshots in their Amazon reviews which is what assured me to get it in the first place.

Let each individual project stay focused on doing one thing really well so that the needs of each one don't come into conflict and nothing can drag the others down.

jhw61jv,"This is not an excuse but as an FYI...

Parse (verb) and parser (noun - something that parses) are such common terms in programming that we (programmers) tend to forget that it might not be so common for most people.

When a compiler reads source code, it parses the source code. When you load an XML file you do via an XML parser. Same with YAML or JSON or INI files etc. 

When you as a human read a sentence, and make sense of subject, objects, verbs, nouns and pronouns, relate which pronouns relates to  which, see where there are subordinate clauses etc, the mental process that you're doing is called parsing.

A parser typically turns a linear stream of ""tokens"" (eg sequence of words and punctuation as defined by the rules of that language about what makes a ""token"") into a tree of symbols structured according to the rules of the language.

A simple parser may take ""1+ 2 \* -3"" and typically first a stage of parsing (or a ""lexer"") will break that into the tokens `1` and `+` and `2` and `\*` and `-3` and then the parse will build that into a tree where the structure shows that the multiplication is done before the addition.

So any operation that ""*reads some sort of mostly flat config, makes sense of it all, resolves references etc and determines the correct structure*"" tends to be called, in techie terms, parsing...",SteamDeck
jhw2fod,"that step is just for adding the emulators and roms to your steam library. whatever emulators you have installed and roms you have downloaded in their correct folder will show up in this list. parsing, if I recall correctly, is just the computer identifying which parts are related to each other. so in emudecks case, it would be relating each rom to its correct emulator so that when you launch it from steam, it runs in the emulator that it's meant for. I'm not sure what wasn't working for you, but ensure that the emulators you want to use are installed and that your roms and bios (if needed) are in the correct location. then load up roms manager, go to preview, make sure the window is full screened so that you can see everything and if it all looks good then click ""save"" and everything should be in your steam library under ""collections"", all organized in folders",SteamDeck
jhw3wmi,"Yeah using the term ""parser"" so heavily in that workflow is kind of shortsighted, hopefully they rephrase it at some point. A few lines of explanation would make clear that the first step is to select categories of games and emulators to find, and then it will produce a list of candidates to add to your library. The word parser isn't needed (even if that's what's going on in the back end).",SteamDeck

ji4bxfm,"So... I'm assuming you know how to mod those games on the PC, right?

The easiest way to mod on the Deck is to do all your modding on windows, then copy over the data folder and the file that the game uses to detect your load order. I don't remember what file that was in particular offhand though.

This goes for both Oblivion and Skyrim.

The problem with modding these games on the Deck is that there aren't any linux versions of MO2 or Vortex yet, so it's hard to install and reorder mods the convenient way. You can use steamtinkerlaunch/protontricks to install the windows versions, though the process is janky and doesn't work terribly well in my experience.",SteamDeck
ji3d4e9,I’m pretty sure this has been talked about a lot. I’d search the sub or YouTube.,SteamDeck
ji4che1,Why is the load order so important I keep hearing about this? Also when you say modding on windows you mean do everything in desktop mode and put those downloads in the right folders?,SteamDeck
ji3favp,"I’ve search and search, but no one has made a video for oblivion specifically for steam deck",SteamDeck
ji4ehd5,"Ah. So you don't know how to mod these games on the PC. That's fine, but I was assuming more knowledge than you possess. Let's start from the basics. Bear in mind that I haven't modded these games in a few years, so I'm a little rusty:

With Skyrim and Oblivion (and FO3/4/NV), most mods come in the form of plugins. Either .esm or .esp plugins. ESMs are your core modules. For example, Skyrim itself is an ESM. Dragonborn is an ESM. Generally, ESMs don't modify the core game, they're their own separate base. ESPs are plugins which are dependent on a given ESM, and modify a specific aspect of the data contained in that ESM. 

The problem comes when you have two plugins that want to modify the same part of the esm. Say we had a mod that turns all horses into My Little Pony style rainbow horses, and another that turns them all into Thomas the Tank Engine style trains. Both mods edit horses into something else, and these changes can't coexist; you can have a rainbow pony, or a train pony, not both.

Load order is how you determine which mod ends up loading. The lower it is on the load order, the later it will load and thus override any mods that changed the same things it does that went before it.

Ergo you need to know which mods you want to take precedence over other mods in case they conflict. (You can also sometimes download compatibility patches, which will try to harmonize the changes in two specific mods - these will always want to go below the mods they're meant to make compatible.)

Most mods you download will go into the game's /data folder, but you'll usually have to unzip them and make sure the file folder structure is right. 

Now, when I say ""mod on PC"", what I really mean is ""mod on Windows."" As in, take a copy of the game on Windows, mod it to your liking, then copy over the relevant files to the Deck, putting it into the same-named folder on the Deck. I say this is the easiest because the mod tools people use to make modding easy on windows don't yet exist conveniently on the Deck's linux environment. This means you generally have to either find a way to get MO2/Vortex working on linux - which is possible but janky - or install your mods manually.",SteamDeck
ji3fv4y,"Steam deck should function the same as any other pc, just copy the mods over",SteamDeck
ji4n2r0,"Thank you for responding with such great detail, you have given me something to learn and study, i and enlighten that you have this much knowledge on modding, I feel as though you should make a through video of explaining exactly how to put the LTD Vampire overhaul on oblivion and also how I can do the same for Skyrim except Skyrim has a different mod name (bat transformation powers, sacrosanct, dark envoy for example, if I can just get a video explaining those I would be willing to pay that person.

I have a save I'm using for testing below the leaning towers after the escape from Boston.

Inside the tower is still anything from 23-26fps, it's an absolutely awful experience.

If anybody is in here trying to decide whether this patch makes the game worth a purchase, please don't listen to the claims of good performance you'll get here and wait for more patches.

preorders are only a small fraction of sales and they don't even release the money on those until the actual product is released. Valve holds it all in escrow and so do retail shops like walmart or gamestop.  

So who does ""don't preorder"" benefit, if it's not the end user?  Youtubers.  Consider this. A youtuber only has an audience if those people want their opinion. But their opinion on  a preordered product is less meaningful and their audience won't benefit from that as much. So they create lies that suggest preorders are killing the industry!  


Preorders are just a way for publishers to engage with fans better. It's not a bad thing and it's not hurting your gaming experience if someone else preorders anything. If Street Fighter 6 is going to be a flopped release, banning all preorders won't change that. If there were no preorders it may even cause the product to get rushed out faster.

2) 35W is 35W and 15W is 15W. Node efficiencies are baked in, and translate to performance per watt, but if you're running at 15W, you'll drain the same battery size of the Steam Deck at the same rate of the Steam Deck, regardless of node, and likewise, if you're running at 35W, you're going to get less than half the battery life of the Steam Deck.",SteamDeck

If you plug it in, then of course, it will surpass the Steam Deck significantly at a much higher TDP, but this defeats the entire point of a handheld. A desktop, which in this case can still be a super tiny HTPC, can outperform both, running at an even higher TDP.

The simple fact is that these chips don't honestly even make sense. It only serves a specific niche of people that want a single device that can run handheld or docked, but excels at neither. The Steam Deck presents a better handheld experience and an HTPC presents a better ""docked"" experience. It saves you from needing two separate things I guess, but depending on the cost of the device, you might be able to afford both for the same or less.",SteamDeck
ji5g9ur,"By that same logic, the XBox Series X at 150 watts (but higher TFlops) would be  inferior to XBox One X at 180 watts.",SteamDeck
ji5br6n,"According to AMD's performance slides, their 15 watt Z1 (not extreme) is 2.6 TFlops versus Steam Deck 1.6 TFlops. I do not agree with your argument that it is ""basically a Steam Deck"" when scaled down, nor that TFlops are an entirely useless metric when comparing performance between SOCs.

Furthermore, battery life tests between Steam Deck in Windows and SteamOS do not show a huge disparity, so I don't think the Windows penalty is a huge argument against it (in fact, probably the opposite as most games will be running in the OS they were designed for without the extra Wine/Proton layer).",SteamDeck
ji5h7be,Why? It's not only about TFlops and it's not only about wattages. It's about everything combined together.,SteamDeck
ji5d0o3,"1. ""According to AMD's performance slides"". Never trust a slide deck. It's pure marketing.

2. Teraflops is a long known meaningless metric. Marketing departments love it because it sounds impressive, but there's dozens of other factors that add up to the actual real performance.

3. Again, devices like Ally are rolling the extra performance into higher resolution, which is honestly a totally boneheaded move, again, likely driven by marketing. A 7in screen at 800p is already pixel dense enough. You're not gaining anything by going to 1080p, but lowering the actual throughput the device would have had if you just stuck at 800p.

Between those three things, I expect no appreciable difference in performance between a Steam Deck and something like the Ally constrained to the same 15W TDP. Maybe a few FPS here or there, but nothing to write home about. Only time and actual independent full reviews will tell, though. Asserting anything either way at this point is folly.

Not even sure where the Windows stuff came in. I never once mentioned Windows. All I ever said about battery life is that the TDP speaks for itself. Unless there's a significantly larger battery than the Steam Deck's, which given that the Ally is actually a little lighter is unlikely, it will drain as fast as the Steam Deck at 15W, and more than twice as fast at 35W. That's just math.",SteamDeck

It's better to focus on the positives and be grateful for what you do have. I think that's the best way to get out of a funk. I'm lucky to have amazing parents and be born in the United States; I mean, what more can I ask for? I am incredibly blessed, and focusing on the blessings and grace you've been given and helping others that are less fortunate is the best medicine for tragedy. 

I had the opportunity to go on a humanitarian trip to help out the Hatianos in the bateyes in the Dominican Republic. Say what you will about the efficiency of humanitarian work (it's not, lol), but being there and seeing people in much worse shape than I have ever been, but still smiling and being grateful despite their condition really changed how I look at suffering.

In this case, your best scenario would be having an nvme enclosure to slap the SteamDeck internal storage after removing it, a machine with Linux (windows *will not* read it since it's not formatted in a format that can understand) or a thumbstick to fire up a Linux distribution live.

You could also seek the help of another deck owner.

Consider this: when trying to carve such small files,  either they will come up immediately, or you might want to try a deeper scan.

A deeper scan will carve out any kind of data it might find, but filenames will be *absolute random garbage*.

You will need to sift trough that (you might end up piling up few thousands of files) trying to identify them with fingerprinting or by size (another whole different problem to solve).

Privileges can only be enforced within a system as a means of policing itself. A separate system that has write access to the root partition of the first (such as the installation ISO has over the on-device drive) doesn't need to respect anything.

ji1wczy,"You can do that easily with the ""save game override"" option under ""Overrides"" in Quick Menu.

Edit:

Wait, you're talking about Core options. For that, you have to go into ""Manage Core options"" under ""Options"" in Quick Menu and save it with ""Save Game option"".

It's a bit confusing at first. Retroarch has basically 3 different places where you can save specific things, that would be Shaders, Core options and the rest, as global, core, directory or game option.

Have a look at this:

ji27aha,"I'm clearly pretty slow at this. I'm going into the game menu -> Core Options -> set RDP Plugin to ParaLLEI-RDP, then Overrides -> Save Game Overrides. So then Active Override File = \[Game\].cfg.

Then I go out into another game, re-set RDP Plugin to GLideN64, and I can see that Active Override File = n64.cfg.

But then when I go back to the first game, Active Override File = \[Game\].cfg but RDP Plugin is now showing as GLideN64.",SteamDeck
ji2a53t,"Ok, I figured it out. I was updating Game Overrides, but I should've been updating the Core Options file.

So go into the game, Click both left and right sticks to enter Quick Menu -> Core Options -> set unique RDP Plugin as needed -> navigate back to Core Options -> Manage Core Options -> Save Game Options. That will save a standalone .opt file for this game only. Awesome!",SteamDeck
ji2h62z,"Yep, exactly. Good job! Out of curiosity:

Why aren't you using ParaLLEl in general for N64? It's much better in terms of accuracy.",SteamDeck
ji2i88t,"So every time I use it, everything gets more pixelated and overall worse looking and it introduces a lot of graphical glitches and framerate performance issues for ""intensive"" parts of the game (by N64 standards lol). Maybe it's just a default settings issue? GLiden64 doesn't have any of that.",SteamDeck
ji2lc46,"May I ask to which game you are referring?

I already played some of the most demanding games for N64 like Perfect Dark, Conker's Bad Fur Day etc. They are indeed running fine. The point about ParaLLel is accuracy. So games run, more or less, 1:1 like they would on a real N64 regarding graphics and performance. So, slowdowns as much like perhaps some blurryness are a part of the experience because it's happening on real N64 hardware too. Though, graphical glitches should not be present. For instance, Perfect Dark runs with 10-20 frames, depending on the scene, on real N64. When it comes to Emulation, specifically N64, I like to have an original experience as much as possible. At least that is my view. :)

In general, the trick to get ParaLLel running good (on Steam Deck) is, to turn off SMT via PowerTools. You can further play with the tdp and/or mhz limits. I wrote down a small guide regarding this stuff some time ago. There it is:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wj7yvm/comment/ijhda0w/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wj7yvm/comment/ijhda0w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Feel free to play around with ParaLLel. But in general, because of its nature, GLiden64 is not as demanding as ParaLLel, so you get a better performance overall, if a system is not capable of running with ParaLLel. Luckily, Steam Deck is. On the other hand, GLiden64 is lacking accuracy. See those screenshots for example:

ji2lx85,"The Super Mario 64 images you sent are a good example of what I was experiencing. A lot more pixilated, but you're saying that's more ""true"" to the original game? I could see the value in that. I'll mess around with the settings more to try and get it working better",SteamDeck
ji2ohpt,"Yeah, it's the more accurate experience, so to say. But it's fine if people don't like that. We have choice and that's good.

But, to combat that low resolution, pixelated look, ParaLLel offers some nice upscaling in the Core options menu. So, in practice, you can render a game in a higher resolution than N64 was capable of and still have this accurate look. I do only recommend setting it to 2x, though. Not more, or your Steam Deck will suffer, haha. And in some demanding games, like Perfect Dark, I experienced some issues in form of glitches and bad performance in special situations, like using the spy eye. So, they might be a few games where upscaling shouldn't be used on Steam Deck.

Here is an article about the upscaling function:

>It’s a little more discreet overall, and it does that without sacrificing any power.

He says this, but just a few lines above, also says this about the switch flick that makes it quieter:

>Even better is that I was able to quickly toggle on a silent setting with a quick menu tap, cutting virtually any excess noise (though it caused Forza Horizon 4’s frame rate to plummet from 60 to 30 instantly, as you might expect).

So you **are** sacrificing power to run it quiet. What about when it is running at full power? Well, you can look in my dubious claims section for that.

&#x200B;

Then he writes about customization as a strong point, as if the Steam Deck didn't have the same features if not more.

>The level of customization here is another area that has me high on the system at first glance. \[...\]   
>  
>Pressing a dedicated button on the device brings up a fast pop-out menu that lets users manage their performance settings and more with some quick taps. Midgame, I could easily pop it open and adjust my frame rate cap, resolution, refresh rate, and other settings with some fast taps. 

All features that the Steam Deck has. Next.

>Every button on the Ally can be remapped to controller, mouse, keyboard, and numpad functions

And he keeps talking about that. He even goes into ""complex keyboard commands"", rehashing in words **everything the Steam Input System can already do** as if ROG Ally's offering is new.

&#x200B;

>Valve’s 60Hz 1200 x 800 screen

Again, lie. It's 1280 x 800. If you specify 1920x1080 for the ROG Ally, at least get the resolution correct for the Deck.

&#x200B;

>I was on track for the battery to run out within an hour. \[...\] a lot of high-end games tap out around there on Steam Deck

Again, lies. Correct me if I am wrong, but I have never seen a healthy battery on a steam deck, at 100%, last under 1h50. At least.

I don't know about you, but testing noise level in a showroom is bound to bring you crappy results in comparing noise level.

&#x200B;

>a happy middle ground between a Steam Deck and a Nintendo Switch. It’s more comfortable than either as well

Which is all well and good and an opinion, no problem with that. But take this quote, from the same reviewer, about his Steam Deck One Year later article:

>If I have the option between playing on my Switch OLED or Steam Deck, I’ll always go with the former. \[...\] What I lose in power and customization, I gain back in comfort and reliability.

Which makes you **really** question his opinion on comfort. It is no secret that the Switch is one of the most uncomfortable handheld device. It definitely is not a strong point of it.

You practically need replacement grips. So I question his opinion on that. Brings doubt over the validity of his review.

>Despite a flashier white design, I feel like I’d be far less self-conscious about breaking out a ROG Ally on an airplane or subway train. It’s a little more discreet overall, and it does that without sacrificing any power.

The author explains that their frame rate is cut in half using the ""silent mode"", then in the next paragraph, says it doesn't sacrifice any power to be quieter... Is this satire?

EDIT: Author also doesn't know that Steam has had the best controller input mapper for years. Thinks being able to remap buttons on the Ally gives it an advantage over the Deck. 😂

One has an operating system that was designed for a handheld. The other is using an OS that was never designed for a handheld but a desktop pc. One is COMPLETELY open source (hardware and software), the other is not. One is controlled by a wise old wizard of a gamer (Gaben), who understand what all of us want in a handheld as the man is a gamer himself. The other is tied to cheap pc's that are great for your grandparents to surf the internets and can be purchased at any Walmart, but gaming is not the primary focus, and most likely never will be. One has incredible control with every base being covered so any game is very playable (even without a mouse and keyboard). the other has plain old joystick controls that will work on some games, and others is going to be severely limited. Lastly, one looks like it was designed by a gamer and is sexy as fuck, the other looks like something a teenage girl would love and is blindly ugly. The only plus is its more powerful, but heat, battery life and cost are the downsides here.  Asus should of paid more attention to what gamers want, instead of going for power. Yes faster frame rates are nice, but if I want faster framerates I'll fire my main pc. The funny thing is my pc has a 3070 and a I9 and I spend WAAAAY more time with my Deck.

jhsvj9o,"Soo... how much is the ROG Ally going to cost?

My take is this... Asus knows they cant compete with the SD on price because of how much more expensive the Ally is, if this wasnt the case, they would have opened with ""for only $100 or $200 you get 2 times the performance of the SD and all these extra features""

Asus is trying to showcase their feature strengths first and build up hype so people can see the extra value so when they finally announce the (high) price of the Ally people feel that it offers more value --> this tactic is marketing BS 101

my guess $799 is the minimum price they will charge for it, my bet is $899; the problem is that at that price it is ""entry level gaming laptop"" range.

The ROG Ally is a device ""for the classes not the masses"" like the SD is... and thats OK, its their market; but it is a bit crazy if Asus expects that the Ally will do SD number of units sold.

All the other handhelds can have any flavor of Linux installed including ones like ChimeraOS. Don't see laptop owners talking down hard on NUCs for being a worse deal.

jht2qz7,"Tit for tat tbh...

No doubt it'll sell and well too, but what it is isn't standing up consistently to where gaming is going any more than the Deck does and will imo.

For both, battery life is a huge concern. Doubting that Asus have either come up with a new battery tech or even leveraged a current experimental one, this'll be a thing (get your powerbanks charged, folks)  The specs that do the biz are somewhat better than the Deck (so back to the battery point) but are also at face asked to do more... 1080p which is nice but not absolutely necessary on such a screen size. I mean, I have a QHD res phone, the last was a HD res, both 6 inches or so and damned if I could tell a difference 99% of the time... (and thus for the Deck's 720-800p, at that size it's at least as good as a laptop screen at 1080p) and at 120Hz... even then good luck getting the most out of that. One of the current hot debates in gaming rn is re 8Gb and 1440p... well, it hasn't always been enough consistently at 1080p either so a bit better than a Deck is still going to come with caveats. Of which I'm happy with what the Deck can do. Sure, maybe medium settings and 30 fps is trash but away from my desk (desktop) or bed or couch (laptop) what other options are there that don't come with certain and mostly similar conditions? Oh, also no touch pads... I'll admit not a thing I've used much on Deck but certainly will be useful over time as non 1st/3rd person and/or controller optimised games are a big part of my play (though I must admit I like the RGB rings on the sticks)

I actually took a little browse re this, as I haven't been bothered so far. At least one article pointed out that the Deck doesn't play well with XBGP, EGS aso... which isn't exactly true, so I don't know what's going on there. Sure, setting the Deck up to do more than ootb takes some research and knowledge but it's nothing one can't do with a few years of accumulated PC gaming know how already under their belt... or a couple of hours to google etc. So yeah, the Ally will be better ootb/for casuals and a bit more speccy overall but it's not a huge deal better nm the possible pricing/availability/scalping it's sure to have as cons. Not saying it won't be good, just not near as much a 'Deck killer' as the Deck was a 'Switch killer'.",SteamDeck

jht8wih,"No doubts it's going to be a decent system. But I'd be very surprised if the Ally is anywhere close to price competitive with the Deck. It's a thoroughly enthusiast device from everything I've seen, while the Deck is more Valve's attempt to appeal to console gamers. Asus also lacks an ecoystem to subsidize the hardware. Not to mention that precompiled shaders are a highly underrated secret sauce for the Deck, which the Ally probably won't have. So expect lots of stutters with UE games. 

That said, more competition in this space is always welcome. While I probably spend the majority of my gaming time with the Deck nowadays, I still kind of see it as a supplementary system to my desktop. If I'm going to play Cyberpunk or (especially) FS2020, I'm going to have a much better time on there.

Yes it will be a better performer but performance is hardly everything and the Deck is no slouch anyway. The high end performance level that grabbed everyone's attention sounds like it will only be on the top end unit which is unlikely to be priced in Steam Deck territory.

Then there are the many Deck features - both hardware and software - that are better on Deck or that don't exist at all on the Ally. Trackpads, more back buttons, gyro, Steam OS, Proton, Steam Input, Valve providing precompiled shaders caches, etc.

Then there's the amazing community from this subreddit to accessory manufacturers to the emulation scene to the official parts store and much more beyond.

Then there's Valve and their commitment to the Steam Deck for the long haul. They will be providing replacement parts and updating the original Deck's software long after the original Ally is discontinued.

I'm not dissing the ROG Ally. I believe it will sell great and I'm glad to see it (and so is Valve). But it's hardly ""Over"" for the Steam Deck which will continue to be well loved long after the original Ally's product lifecycle has come and gone.

It sounds very 'advertisement-disguised-as-opinion'.

At the end of the day, the Ally will perform better cause the hardware is newer by more than a generation, depending on which deck you have.

Depending on what Valve and their R&D department decide to do with the Steam Deck, it's already very modular and extremely DIY friendly, so they could absolutely release hardware upgrade kits to improve performance.

jhu6aca,I'm really excited for the Ally. I didnt get a Deck at launch so I think I'll just skip to that,SteamDeck
jhu8dkn,"Valve is still in a better position here when it comes to making a viable device, because even though Steam Deck is a PC, Valve used some of the console logic for it, like more user friendly interface, control over OS or the ability to take a hit on the price of the hardware because they're selling software for it. Steam OS is just as beneficial for the Steam Deck as its comparatively low price. 

Now, if Valve makes the current version of Steam OS available for everyone, then things can become interesting on the PC handheld market, because that alone can drive the price of the devices further down, since Windows ain't free.",SteamDeck
jhu8yip,"The hardware is better. Its a year newer maybe even more depending on when it ships.  So yea makes sense. Don't think it's enough to jump from my steam deck  ans I am sure next year there will be something better than this

jhua7ut,"Is there a hidden touchpad somewhere in the Ally? I'm sure it doesn't matter to most people, but the touchpads on the Steam Deck are indispensable to me, and I wouldn't want to move to a device without them. They're too handy for playing point and click adventure and other games that are much more conducive to mouse movement.",SteamDeck
jhubi84,"Convenient that amd Asus and Microsoft worked together to make this happen. And don't tell me that Ms didn't work on a handheld mode for real after reading about this shit. That and the free three months included with every one sold too. 

Too much of a coincidence. I wouldn't put it past amd holding out on offering that chip instead of the one they sold to valve to sell to Asus instead. 

We will have to see when they do that reveal next month. It only has Xbox handheld division speaking there, Asus division speaking and a amd handheld rep. 

Smells like this was privately in the works since valve revealed their steam deck as a possible counter to Linux taking up anymore space in the handheld market vs Microsoft. Ms doesn't want them to get any traction on it for sure. 

But one thing is certain: this device will be between 800 and up to twice as much as the top of the line steam deck offering. So not worth it. Don't care if they pack it in every Walmart and best buy for sale from coast to coast. 

The price point is what makes the SD appealing. Pricing shit at laptop prices puts it out of the hands of parents thinking of stuff for their kids or family members buying gifts. Turns it into a niche product instead. 

Plus you got windows on every one. That costs licensing fees. I'm sure Asus isn't eating the cost, and that free 3mo game pass is somewhere in that cost too. As well as the Asus brand tax they put on everything they sell since they have been selling electronics. Always a premium with their shit. 

So I'm not sweating it fr. It's going to do maybe paltry sales. And even less for the egpu addon. That thing is a joke too.. come on, 1800-2000 for one with a 4090 in it, get real. It's like 1200-1500 for the 3080 model.

jhui0ly,"It's not even a competitor at that predicted 
 price point.",SteamDeck
jhui2m3,"It's lighter than the SD, which is ironically a major concern. Everything else aside, there's no way the battery life is good.

The SD has a 5200mAh battery, assuming this is lithium-ion that's pushing 200g *just for the battery*. Considering they've managed to shave off 60g compared to the SD (bringing it down to 608g), there's no way they've chosen to cram a bigger battery into it, so I'll be reasonably optimistic and say it's also 5200mAh. I'm also basing this on the fact asus themselves claim ""comparable"" battery life when both are running at 15W.

They now have to run a more powerful APU (not sure how much by but it supposedly boosts to 30W), running games at a higher frame-rate (up to 4x) and resolution (around 2x pixels), into a brighter screen (x1.25). With the SD the APU doesn't go past 15W and you can reasonably assume another 15W for everything else (hence absolute worst-case results of just under 90 minutes, 40Wh/30W=1.333=80min). From just the APU alone, you could have 50% more power draw from it boosting, which pushes playtime under an hour.

Remember how SD got slated for poor battery life despite 2h being perfectly usable in a lot of cases and being able to push it over 8h in indies? If the non-APU draw on this is worse than the SD you could hit *half an hour* of battery life, and squeezing every last minute out of the battery goes against what this device is supposed to be. After all, if you wanted long battery life, why not get an SD and external battery pack?

I'm guessing the price is going to be $850 as well. It's ""under $1000"", but surely they would state it's close to $500 if that were the case in order to build hype. This isn't competing with SD at all, it's trying to eat the market other companies built up for high-end handhelds.

Finally, here's the telling thing about all of this: There's a decent amount of info about this floating around like the processor type and how much memory it has. Price and battery? Nothing, all speculative. I don't remember if price was known before-hand, but I'm almost positive full specs were available for the SD before pre-orders were open.",SteamDeck
jhui4jx,"The Ally just shows me what Valve can source now, too. The VRR screen is the real selling point here. Doubling the TDP to get less than double the performance is a bad trade, which is why Valve didn't target it and shouldn't target it. Imagine having less than hour battery life and thinking that's great.

But that VRR screen is something I hope the Steam Deck's successor gets next year along with a Zen4-based chip with mostly the same TDP as the original. Let the idiots cook their systems with high TDP's. I'll take 15 or less please.",SteamDeck
jhuin5t,"I think this has an audience, but it’s not going to take users away from Steam Deck. They’re two entirely different products, other than being handhelds. SD is definitely for enthusiasts and ROGA is for someone that just wants to pickup a handheld and play GamePass. 

Personally this has limited appeal to me. However it runs GP native and there are some PC GP games I don’t have access to on my XSS. Yes the Deck can do that, but it’s more tedious. It doesn’t bother me, but some people aren’t interested. So in that way this makes sense. I bet that OLED looks fire.",SteamDeck
jhuisyr,"Yeah but inb4 it costs like a cool grand. A not insignificant portion of the reason the Steam Deck is appealing is because of how much cheaper it is than something like a gaming laptop, and from what we know about the specs of the ROG I'm guessing Asus missed that part.",SteamDeck
jhuiwl7,"Totally agree. Can't wait for the ROG ALLY, steam deck was nice but it just feels so outdated compared to this.",SteamDeck
jhuj1ih,Lol depends how much it is,SteamDeck
jhujixs,"If it's under 900, it's a hard-contender for the steam deck.

After tax for the 512gb SD it comes to ~$694.30 USD shipped.

If the ally is a $200 premium for 100% increase in power - let alone the physical upgrades with 120hz full HD+ monitor, better  brightness, and a battery that would keep it on-par with the steam deck's battery life with those higher specs? That's an easy sell, for anyone.

Is it a steam deck ""killer?"" No. Different handheld, different markets. But if the margins end up being that slim between the two devices, this could easily eclipse the SD.

Either way, if it does or doesn't, it's a good thing. Look at it this way: the fact that the ROG Ally exists means Valve accomplished exactly what it set out to do, which was create an industry standard. The SD is the only device in it's bracket with its featureset to be a full-fledged mobile *PC* gaming device. 

+ More devices = bigger ecosystem

- Bigger ecosystem = more choices

* More choices = best outcome for *consumers*

Valve knew what they were doing.. I applaud the SD all the same I applaud the ROG Ally.

For me, the biggest drawback of the Asus ROG Ally is Windows 11. The system doesn’t seem to have the alignment between software and hardware that the deck does. Asus should invest in their optimization and UI because that is where the deck excels as a portable machine. I’ve also heard misgivings about the Ally’s ergonomics.

-	Id love a smaller footprint but not at the expense of two back buttons.

-	Id love a more ergonomic layout for small hands but not at the expense of trackpads. 

-	Id love a USB4/TB port, but not locked to Asus shitty $2000 dock.

-	After customising buttons with macros, radial menus, sub layers, and everything that Valve has spent years building from their valve controller… I can’t see anyone catching up soon when Asus can’t even get armoury crate to work half the time.

Honestly though, all I think about is how great in 3-4 years (or whenever it'll be) the next iteration of the Steam Deck will be.

jht6acd,"This. Also the SD is really a, let's say 800 dollar device being sold at a loss because valve makes money through steam. 

Majority of these articles are just sponsored content paid by Asus to hype their gaming device. They are spending so much on marketing this thing that I'm fully expecting it to be a pump and dump flop. The main comparison is the hardware vs the steam deck, which isn't what gives the steam deck its advantage over competitors. 

The other thing is valve is working to optimize games, UIs and content to work around the steam deck and Linux, and plan to keep working on this SD for several years. Where other brands are just pushing this out at a high price and abandoning them for a newer model that comes out 9 months later. If I pay 400 for a steam deck I know I can keep upgrading it, modifying it and I know it will last, where I can't say the same thing about any competitors. 

That said the Steam Deck does have some major flaws and issues, and it can be a frustrating piece of hardware because of those glaring bugs and issues (specifically the online/offline connectivity issues which brick games until you can get on the internet again), and needing to restart my console once every 24hours because it will refuse to connect to the internet again after its been put into sleep mode, or will just randomly freeze up forcing me to restart.",SteamDeck

I'm also really bummed there are no touchpads. I swear I must be in some extremely small subset of people who realizes how amazing the touchpads mixed with the gyro is for aiming in FPS games for example. The amount of input methods the Steam Deck has doesn't get enough love. No other manufacturers in this demographic seem to value that at all.

I guess some factors can help them to hit a competitive price :

* They have much less work to do on software since they don't build a new Linux distro just for that. They just need to set up some drivers, maybe some custom launcher app (I haven't watched any videos of this device, but other handhelds running Windows generally have), and they are done.
* They are much more experienced in making hardware than Valve and the other handheld small companies that appeared around the Deck time, so they can don't need to waste time on learning/hiring.

1. Price.

2. Battery life.

3. The fact that the base model and the top model have different processors, and reviewers are provided the top model.

4. There's rumors of $649 thrown around, but reviews are based on the top model. 

5. Theres no talk about any long term support. Not even a simple statement like ""asus said they'll be pushing updates for the next year after its released"".

6. No indication about 3rd party upgrades. Ssd swap? 3rd party hall effect joystick?

What's more likely is $649 is for the base model, which will probably be marginally better than the steam deck owing to them not having trackpads, so they can put the costs onto something else.

You can go ahead and forget about built in repairability, support and updates.

As for the price, I totally wrote this thing off purely on probable price.  Asus starts off at an innate disadvantage here because they have to sell the hardware at a profit, like other handheld PC manufacturers.  They don't have a digital storefront to fall back on.

However, unlike other handheld PC manufacturers, they are a major hardware manufacturer and can manufacture these things at scale and sell these at regular retailers, both in physical stores and online stores and Asus has an actual presence in the West.

jhsyj7m,"Not sure it's that so much as Asus is choosing reviewers who tend to gush in extremes, handing them the expensive version of the device whose price they won't say yet, and banking on them being enamored with the special treatment. And it works. 

That said considering the ""PC the form factor of a Switch"" was a non-entity a year or so ago and now it's worthy of being a hot product category, I'm fine with competition. I just suspect that the price of this thing is going to sink any further discussion of it and that the value/experience portion of the equation that Valve has nailed is being undervalued. 

Like there's three points on the scale potentially:

\- Nintendo Switch: cheap, has Nintendo games, but doesn't run any of your existing stuff and needs you to buy or re-buy all their walled garden games

\- Steam Deck: mid-tier priced, runs your Steam library, has a fine tuned experience and is from a vendor willing to forego some amount of profit in exchange for further integration into their ecosystem (how many people on here say they've bought more Steam games once they had the Steam Deck?)

\- Devices from Asus, etc.: probably run better than Steam Deck, and being based on Windows increases out of the box compatibility with stuff like Destiny 2 but comes from a company without a great track record on interface experiences and who needs to make all their profit from the sale of the hardware since they don't see any % of game sales.

jhtt0jo,"Honestly, anyone asking for a higher resolution screen on the Steam Deck hasn't really put much thought into what they're asking for or why they think they want it. Absolute resolution is not as important as pixel density.

The Steam Deck's screen has slightly higher pixel density than a 20.5"" 4k monitor. That means as far as your eye is concerned, the Steam Deck screen is sharper and more detailed than basically any desktop monitor on the market. Unless you're complaining that 4k monitors are not high enough resolution for you when playing on desktop, the screen on the Steam Deck should be high enough resolution for you.

Meanwhile, bigger is not necessarily better. The higher resolution the screen, the more pixels the hardware has to push, which results in higher power draw and worse performance for significantly diminishing returns in terms of image quality. Sure, you could just run the game at a lower resolution, but if you're running at a resolution that the native resolution of your display does not divide evenly into, the image will end up looking softer and worse than on a lower-resolution display working at native resolution.

And here's hoping the games scale their UIs properly, because some games do not, which means at 1080p or higher the game UI ends up being unusably small. This is already a problem with some games at the Steam Deck's current resolution, and the problem would just be further exacerbated with a higher resolution one.

Now, will future Steam Decks have higher resolution screens? Probably. Other companies like Asus here are going to push it on their models as a way of differentiating their product from the Steam Deck, and most people are just going to think bigger equals better, so Valve will have to eventually match them just for optics. But in terms of ways they could improve the Steam Deck, a higher resolution is pretty low on the list in terms of having meaningful effect on the experience, IMO.",SteamDeck

So I created a touch menu on the left track pad that gives me quick access to each of the menus like inventory and such.

Phones have had high resolution and 120 Hz screens for years with tiny batteries.

I'd bet the larger battery more than makes up for the higher power consumption - if it's even higher.

Sure, actually rendering games at 1920x1080 uses more power than rendering that same game (on the same chip) at 1280x800. But upscaling techniques like FSR (2) should still make for a very nice image. Also, you get to use resolutions between 1280x800 and 1920x1080. You just have more flexibility.

The reason why the old control panel is slowly being removed and was not just reskinned is because in the old control panel EVERY single module was a .dll module that could be accessed and controlled with, ***or without,*** the control panel. Each item they move to the new settings is stripped of its ability to directly be interfaced with by the end user, and instead you have to rely on Window's settings to properly reflect what is going on.

The reason why they have been doing it piecemeal is because IT departments in various industries are actively opposed to this and often rely on being able to directly control the .dll modules, so they transferred everything that those departments didn't ***need***, and are slowly depreciating the rest.

Please note that this is not what I believe, this is what ***MICROSOFT*** has said. It is only a matter of time, the moats and the walls are about 60-80% complete in Windows 11, and 12 or 13 is likely when the transition will be done.",SteamDeck

Companies like ASUS are not innovators, they make middling hardware that tries to be price competitive, which they never can be with Valve.

With GNU/Linux, you can just go and fix it if it bothers you that much.

SteamOS has Proton, which actually is on track to making old games, like Windows XP to Windows 7 era games, more playable than trying to run them on Windows 10 or 11. If you like games that don't take a lot of power, and are perfect for a handheld, that's great.


Here's a few things that are technically possible with Linux that haven't been implemented, but could be, and are forever impossible to do with Windows. They revolve around the [USB Gadgets](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/driver-api/usb/gadget.html) feature of the Linux kernel which is a way of giving the USB C port new capabilities:

- hook up your Steam Deck to a windows pc, mac, linux, or another steam deck, and have it pretend to be a usb Ethernet interface. Then, set up Internet Connection Sharing with it on Windows (or the analog on any other OS, including BeOS, AmigaOS, and anything else that supports Ethernet). Now your Steam Deck has the same internet connection as your computer, and you don't need a dock, usb Ethernet dongle, Ethernet cable, a free Ethernet port on your switch, etc. Useful for me since I don't have wifi where I am right now. Also useful because the USB 3 Gen 2 port is 10 Gbit/s, much faster than a typical 1 Gbit dongle, and 10 Gbit dongles and switches still cost a lot. You could also use it to install games directly from what's already on your PC's hard drive.

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it work as a Steam Controller

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it show up as a mass storage device, so you can copy over your files

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it act as an SD card reader, so you can transfer files to the SD card. Basically the same as what's above. But just the SD card.

- hook up two Steam Decks together, have one emulate an Ethernet dongle, and then do local multiplayer. Basically it's a modern Gameboy Link Cable. Use a USB hub on one central deck, and you can link up multiple Steam Decks. You could also eg use this to connect a Steam Deck to any other device, even an ROG Ally. So if you have multiple handhelds, you can play with your friends, just give them one and use the other one.

- pcie-over-usb. This could encapsulate pcie over the usb bus, possibly creating a way to use a thunderbolt-like enclosure that has a very simple cpu running linux, plus a gpu. You could get pcie x1 speeds. But see below for something better.

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it act as an extra HDMI or Display Port display. You could even do controller + display over the same cable. This way you could basically have a full fledged gaming pc with no display or keyboard or mouse, and you'd tether your Deck to the pc and use the pc to render your games and display them on the Deck with zero lag. In fact, you could also transfer files through the same cable, so if you want to launch a game that isn't on the pc's ssd yet, the SD would quickly transfer it over via the usb cable. This would basically make any PC with a fast enough USB port an external gpu dock for the Steam Deck, except: it also has a faster cpu, and more ram, and the GPU gets full pcie x16 instead of x2 or x4 (whichever thunderbolt allows on a port, there are two kinds), and possibly better ssd, and maybe also better networking, cooling, and it would be quieter than the Deck. This is entirely feasible: the 1280x800 resolution on the Deck only requires 1.5 Gbit/sec (185 Megabytes/sec), whereas the USB port can handle many times more.

And the best thing is you wouldn't need any extra hardware for ANY OF THIS. And no hardware upgrades to the Deck. Just a cheap-ass usb c cable. That's literally the cheapest price of entry for any of the above functionality - it can't get cheaper than that. But of course, people would have to program them, and those programming tasks range from difficult but quick, to year+ projects (especially the last one)

I just hope devs come around to using the USB Gadgets feature more, because as you can see above, it is extremely powerful.",SteamDeck

And in this Android-esque walled garden, a PC you built yourself is akin to flashing grapheneOS onto a Pixel.

In the general sense, yes. But unless that API is documented and intended to be utilized by 3rd party applications you're basically setting yourself up for a world of hurt. This is one way that OS changes break things - people using interfaces that are private that then change, causing a delay in rolling out security fixes.  


> more persistent than fiddling with group policies. 

I'm not sure how this is the case.

Anyway, this entire subthread is the same fearmongering that blew up in 2012 when Windows 8 dropped. UWP apps largely failed and Windows is no closer to being a walled garden. Hell even OS X isn't a walled garden, and people have been waiting for that for years.

[This post has some really good info on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/v9mxtb/customize_perf_overlay_mangohud_presets/), specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/v9mxtb/customize_perf_overlay_mangohud_presets/iicz8ct/).",SteamDeck

First, go to the [steam remote storage page](https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage) *(should be a section/item for “Steam Input Configs”, and the file name in there matching the AppID for your game)* and download the most recent controller config file. Just so it doesn’t overwrite it with the default one and if it does you’ll have a backup to re-place it.

Then select the app/game on your Steam Deck, and under the *”Developer”* contextual submenu, choose *”Clear Selected Controller Layout”*. This should clear out the controller settings file back to default, and fix the crashing. The game will of course create a new controller config file.

ji192kl,"I was looking to play other games as well eventually as I see stuff I like on steam. But as of right now, this purchase is for TTS.

To tell you the truth, I don't have much experience gaming on a keyboard. Which is why I was much more excited for the steam deck. I currently have an Xbox and a switch so I'm much more used to gaming with controllers. 

I think buying a dock and connecting to the TV could totally work. I just looked at some on Amazon and they're not as expensive as I was expecting.",SteamDeck
ji1kji5,"I'd recommend the JSAUX docks if you want a third party one. And yeah the controller support on SteamOS is really good! It's very easy to play most games using the Deck's controls or by connecting another controller. If there's anything about a particular control scheme you don't like, there are a ton of remapping options.",SteamDeck
ji1xh1k,"Dock or Hub only matter for convenience. Functionally, there is no real difference. I bought some usb-c hubs with everything I needed for \~15 bucks and left them where I might use them, because I tend forget where I left such things :)Just make sure the hub can deliver enough power. 60W PD are pretty much minimum, 100W is what I bought.

Again, TTS with deck controls certainly works, so maybe you'll be happy with that after a while. I don't know of any game where I regularly use that many buttons, though, so I wanted to hint you in that direction.

In the end, I don't think you'll be sad about your decision. I have a laptop and found myself using the deck as a replacement for that but never the other way round. It's really versatile.",SteamDeck
ji3yaox,"Thank you for telling me that! I would of never known there was no difference between a dock and hub.

Decks' OS is nice, trackpads are quite useful, Win10/11/Dual boot is possible, battery life is decent, 60hz screen is OK (mine runs at 70hz fine), fan gets annoying without thermal mods.

Asus' Ally 120hz Freesync will be nice, battery life is unknown, 15w performance vs Deck is unknown, 1080p might neutralize APU power difference, Windows may suck on it, no trackpads, only 2 backbuttons, cooling system appears to be vastly superior.

If price is comparable to Deck 512GB, i may snag one to see, and give whichever i dont care for to my sister. I didnt use the trackpads on the Deck at all initially, omce i got used to them, i realized they are invaluable in soo many little ways.",SteamDeck

For me personally I wanted a handheld, not a laptop so in that regard SD did the trick. It’s easy to use, intuitive and Valve keeps pumping out updates to improve it. All set and done, it’s an ‘affordable’ device, especially if you go the 64gig route and replace the hard drive yourself. 

I have read about Aya neo and now the RoG Ally, if it’s anything like my sons laptop (rog) well then it will look good on paper but will suck in practice. Main thing is how they will balance performance and battery life. Personally I think the Steamdeck does a impressive job with that. 

M8 grass will always be greener, and my tact is, take a well informed descision and after you do, stop looking into this kinda stuff cause it will drive you crazy 😂 Iam happy, very happy with my deck and as long as it can do what I want it to, Iam not even interested in anything else.",SteamDeck

If I was making the decision again today, I might still go for the Deck, as I really enjoy Steam OS, and trust Valve to keep working on the software side more than other hardware manufacturers. That said, I think I'd feel very differently if I played any multiplayer games, especially those that rely on Windows only anti-cheat software.",SteamDeck

The screen is a very nice upgrade on paper but I use either a dock or the Nreal Air for the higher resolution for games that can take it.

ji3rubk,"The official pricing and availability announcement for the Ally is May 11th. 

Right now, everything being discussed is based on speculation, rumor, and leaks. The only official word from Asus, until the 11th, is ""It will be below $1,000"" and ""It will be available for purchase sooner than most people think"". 

The other thing we know is that it is using a custom APU from AMD. Initial benchmarks put its performance at 11% higher OpenCL score over the Ryzen 6800U (chip in the Ayaneo 2). The Ayaneo 2 performs about 20% better than the Steam Deck in most titles. This is operating at a TDP of 30w, with the Z1 Extreme operating at speeds up to 5ghz -- leaving many questions about battery life and cooling. 

The rumored/leaked pricing is $700, and the availability date is rumored to be as early as Q3 of this year. Other than that, there is nothing more to base a purchase on until May 11th. 

So the question you have to ask yourself is if there is a chance you are willing to pay between $700 and $1,000 for an Ally to achieve 20 to 30% more frames per second over a Steam Deck. Also, keeping in mind that with the power consumption and cooling concerns, that performance may only be feasible when docked. 

If the answer is yes, then wait until May 11th to get at least basic info, if not longer to start seeing real product reviews (and not just paid marketing pieces). If the answer is no, then I would still wait until May 11th to be absolutely sure, and if you're not blown away, *then* put in your order for a Steam Deck.",SteamDeck

ji3upzr,"according to benchmarks ROG Ally is being insanely overhyped just like the Aya Neo was, according to benchmarks its barely able to handle RDR2 720P 60FPS lowest settings with FSR. Steam Deck gets 40-50 fps at the same settings. at 1080P the most RDR2 will hit is around 40fps. hell even linus video talks about Horizon Zero Dawn having performance between 20fps-40fps and you can see RE4 having performance issues. people always fall for the hype",SteamDeck
ji3xi6w,"Ok, so to break this down (again):  The Rog Ally is clearly a device that focuses on super fancy aesthetic showmanship and ""Super big power!!!"" to try and market itself, instead of actually focusing on the stuff that would make it a good handheld.

It might be good, but generally this kind of marketing tends to imply that it's going to be lacking in a lot of other areas.  We don't know how good the control customization is going to be on the Ally, we know that it apparently only gets battery life comparable to the Deck when both are running at 15w(And the thing goes up to..30w I think? So, y'know, that's definitely not good).

We also know it has a 1080p screen which 'sounds' nice, but keep in mind that means that games on the Ally are going to require more power, which means battery life might be a concern.  Another thing is if they're trying to price competitively with the Steam Deck, that means that build quality is definitely going to be a concern, since they're clearly putting so much focus on the ""power"".

And of course there's also the lack of trackpads, I STILL haven't seen any confirmation of gyro, etc.  Keep in mind that you'd be paying more for a system that basically can only play games with controller support, and you better hope that controller support is good.  All this for a system that's only going to maybe do a little bit better in some games.

If you want an idea of just what the Ally is probably going to be, Bringus Studios did a video on the [ONEXPLAYER 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5OFC3wESc), which is probably going to be very similar to the Ally in a lot of ways in terms of performance(And I'mma be honest, it's probably going to perform better than the Ally.).",SteamDeck
ji403w0,"Nobody can actually answer this since the Ally has nothing but marketing hype to go off of. If it lived up to that hype it would be a very strong contender, with the Deck's main advantages coming in the touchpads/extra buttons and open platform allowing repairs and community tweaks better than the Ally's closed platform windows environment. On the other hand, the Ally would have very strong performance going for it.

That being said:

Two less back buttons and no touchpads (and thus no virtual menus) is a no for me, even if I wasn't deeply unimpressed with the actual benchmarks we have for the Ally thus far. I don't use the touchpads for every game, but for the games I do, they're vital.

And don't even get me talking about the lack of pause function. Trying to put games to sleep in Windows is a bad joke.

Even the horsepower argument doesn't hold up too well IMO. RDR2 at 70 FPS for the extreme Ally sounds insanely impressive until you look at the fine print and discover it's 720p upscaled to 1080p, all settings on low, at a *30w TDP - Literally twice as much as the Deck.* For something that claims to be like 3/4ths of a PS5 and like 2-3x the raw horsepower of a Deck, I expected much more. 

The cheap Ally? Same battery-destroying TDP and same poor settings, except you get like +5FPS better than a Deck running the same game. Is 5 FPS worth having a battery that lasts an hour or less? 

Unless AMD's released benchmarks are lying, the Ally is a lot less awesome than ASUS' paid marketing hype would have us believe. 

Honestly, the more I think about the Ally the more I doubt it actually has a niche. Its only real advantages are performance and anticheat/gamepass compatibility. But to get its performance you need to run off a 30w TDP according to AMD's benchmarks. This basically means you're chained to a wall outlet.

But if you're giving up the portable part of a handheld, why would you buy an Ally when you could buy a desktop that'll have vastly more performance? You can build a pretty nice desktop for $700 for the Ally's alleged asking price and it'll be about as portable in practice lol.

Unless you play competitive shooters, or exclusively play brand new AAA games, the ally doesnt look like it offers a compelling upgrqde as of right now. No doubt, it will be more powerful. No one is arguing it won't be. But aside from TLOUp1, there is nothing in my que or on my wishlist that the steam deck won't play. And I suspect that is the case with most people. No, Hogwarts legacy doesn't play perfectly, no, red dead2 doesn't play perfectly. But those are the exceptions, not the rule. And the new Star wars probably won't either. And that's fine. I haven't played the first one yet.

I wouldn't even consider an ally until steam os is running on it. And the ally has some massive advantages over the SD. It has anti-cheat, 120hz, and is MUCH more powerful. If those things matter to you, and there are good reasons why they might, the ally could represent a good buy. 

I love my steam deck. But if youre in the market for a 512 SD right now, you would've dumb not to at least wait to see what the ally has to offer. 

Anyone can plainly see that. 

(The ps5 and Xbox are the same thing. Like actually. They are both locked down x86 systems that play mostly the same games as each other, and run at basically the same speed and graphical fidelity, at this point, the choice of which one people buy waa made decades ago when they were deciding bwtween a ps2 and an Xbox.

ji5l2nt,"Aye, I can’t see inside your head, or your preferences. All I know is that a steamdeck is a solid purchase wich will play a lot of your games and will be relevant for a long while. Like games as GoW and FF7 Remake run flawlessly on the device. If you have a backlog like me (25 games yet to be played) that alone will set you up for a long while. Also all the complaints about LCD and screen size I really don’t understand, it’s good and pretty.

Also if you have a pc you can stream your games to the deck when your at home. Wich is another big selling point for me. That and the fact you can easily replace pieces of hardware yourself if something breaks.

ji67mlu,Question: would you be okay with buying the Steam Deck and selling it at a slight loss if the Ally turns out really good?,SteamDeck
ji3z6iq,"I’m happy to share more too if it helps you further. 


I’ve had a mostly good experience with the Steam Deck. There’s certain things about it that are really limiting though. There’s a lot of multiplayer games that will not work on Steam OS due to conflicts with the anti cheat used by the game. For the most part, I don’t really care to play MP on a handheld, but there’s some games I would like to sometimes play and chill/grind out challenges or whatever instead of playing them at my desk on PC. That just isn’t an option unless I install Windows. 


It does play older games really well, even some of the notoriously bad PC ports work well on the Deck. I recently replayed GTA IV, locked 40FPS throughout. A very pleasant experience. Great too for Fallout 3/NV/Oblivion/Skyrim. Even Fallout 76 runs pretty well on the Deck in my experience with it. 


That said, you have to really temper your expectations for newer big budget games. To the point that I wouldn’t recommend buying a Steam Deck if you’re wanting to primarily play the latest releases on it. 


As for the Asus handheld. I think the hardware looks good. I’m glad to see AMD pushing out newer mobile APUs designed with handhelds in mind. I think the device’s fate will be determined heavily on how Asus handles the software side of it. I’ve personally had a bad time on that front with Asus in the past. 


Long story short, I bought an Asus Zephyrus laptop for my girlfriend some years back. On paper, the specs were good. It had great reviews from YouTubers for being an affordable and competent gaming laptop. In reality, it was hot and loud, and to add to the pain, mostly required Asus’ armoury crate software to control the different profiles. 

The cherry on top was a bug that resulted in the CPU getting locked to 400mhz randomly. Not an issue related to temps at all. It just did it when it decided it wanted to ruin any enjoyment you were having in game by plummeting the FPS into the single digits. This issue was never fixed via software/bios updates either. 


So I’m quite skeptical personally of the Asus Ally.",SteamDeck

With ROG Ally being intended for Windows out of the box, I think we can expect basic driver functionality.

I've been in both playstation and Xbox subs and they're nowhere near as toxic as this sub.

In this sub, most people have only owned a Deck as their handheld PC and intend on keeping only the Deck so they don't know what to do when someone asks about something else, they just get defensive like a lot of comments here are showing",SteamDeck

ji3zovt,"The title was not the best choice then but I’m sorry for misinterpreting you.

I’ve had fun with the Steam Deck. The SteamOS gaming mode interface is very much like a console experience so it’s pretty easy to get used to. It runs Linux so game compatibility is not as good as a dedicated Windows machine so if you’re looking to play stuff that requires anti-cheat software like competitive shooters, you’d be better off with a Windows machine. 

There are a lot of community projects that enhance the experience like Emudeck for emulation or Decky Loader for plugins. Overall, I’d say the software experience is kind of a gift and a curse in that it’s constantly getting more and better updates, but in the end, it’ll always require Proton, the translation layer that makes Windows games run on Linux, and therefore it’s always a moving target in terms of compatibility. In my experience, the only hiccup I’ve had with a game that was marked “playable” by Valve was due to a 3rd party launcher from Ubisoft.

And ergonomics and button layout is a personal preference thing. Some people find it comfy (myself included) and others find it cumbersome so YMMV.",SteamDeck

ji3xout,Thank you! I was quite diligent in how I was going to put together the question.,SteamDeck
ji42rgh,"Nah, an apology was def necessary. It sucks to be ganged up on for a misunderstanding.

Yeah I would say that one of the main selling points for the Steam Deck is the community engagement. If you have an issue, you’ll probably be able to Google it and find a tutorial. The other handheld PCs besides the Ally (OneXplayer, GPD, Ayaneo) sell so few units before moving on to new hardware that there isn’t that big of a community for support.

I will say that the ROG Ally is definitely gonna sell like hotcakes due to the price and the retail options so it’ll also have a big community but they might not be as engaged as Linux diehards are for the Steam Deck.

I do kinda fear that this thing is gonna get scalped like the early PS5s due to the demand but hopefully ASUS has enough stock to meet demand considering theyre pretty big manufacturers of PCs.",SteamDeck

It’s like of you tell someone who has one hand free to hold your coffee. Then someone else comes along and tells them to hold their beer. If it’s going to do what person 2 tells it, it has to stop doing what person 1 told it to do.

So for instance, in Cyberpunk 2077, I can tell it not to use anything, but set the resolution to 1152x720, and set to use full screen. In the performance overlay, it will show **FSR: ON**. But if I go into Cyberpunk’s settings, and tell it to turn on FSR2.1, the system overlay will then show FSR: OFF; because it automatically stops doing it that way.

Same happens if you toggle the in-game FSR1 to on; I tried that in Horizon Zero Dawn as well.

So you never have to worry about the OS-level one. It will just do it’s thing **when needed** if it can *(game is set to full screen and using a lower than native res)*.

I tell the app/game in Steam’s settings to run at 1280x720 *(but the external display is set to 1080p)*, and it upscales it using FSR so it looks good at 1080p, but the performance is same/similar to when I am using the Deck’s display *(which is 1280x800)*.",SteamDeck

jhx14hk,"I do something similar professionally with scientific software on large linux clusters, and have some tips:

1. I would set -e at the start as well as -x.  This will cause it to exit on errors where a step fails - makes it easier to debug.  I'd also set -u as that will cause it to halt if an environment variable is unset.

2. I would set all the variables with the URLS/versions near the top so they are easy to find. You can also do a neat construct like this:

VARIABLENAME=${VARIABLENAME:-default_value) 

This sets the variable to a default value unless it's already set in the environment - this is really neat because at launch you could do something like:

origin_url=url_to_mirror ./NonSteamLaunchers.sh 

to override where it downloads from at run time.

3. If you continue with the route where you download specific, non-changing versions of the installers then I'd encode in sha512sum checks of the files to make sure they have downloaded properly - we run into issues all the time with software developers changing the location of download files and you end up trying to unpack an html error page :(

This is where the problem comes in when you have to start juggling different runners for different games. It will affect the launcher prefix, which can lead to a different launcher/game failing to run.

It would be better to have each launcher in its own respective prefix and having each of one brand's games dependent on that prefix. That way when EA eventually breaks and requires a different runner from Ubisoft, you don't break the currently working one or trigger a logout due to a runner change. All of EA's games will remain logged in as they share the one EA prefix, etc.

jhv22gg,"> But that's what a windows PC does no?

Yes, but Wine interactions are different than an actual Win PC. They have different fixes and hacks to get things running. Each game can require different ones, and some may conflict with others as you start layering them in.

> if Diablo needs a specific proton then run it with that. You can mix and match what launcher runs with what and what game runs with what.

Diablo is dependent on the battle.net prefix. When you run the game in that prefix and change the runner, you are changing the files within the prefix to reflect the changed version of Proton. This can overwrite another set of fixes applied for another game. 

It's a better practice to not mess with another game's prefix when it's working. This process of sharing prefixes goes the exact opposite direction from that.

Again, if space is a concern, just use btrfs. if you have files that are common across multiple prefixes (which is the case for a lot of prefixes), they won't take up extra space for each duplicate version. I save ~8GB on my Deck just in prefix deduplication alone.",SteamDeck

Most notable tips-

*Use latest Proton-GE (Apply compatibility layer in game mode) after adding the game's .exe as a non-steam game. (Don't use the launcher .exe as that just gives an infinite loading screen)

*Rename the EPIC folder (Example EPIC.bck) or the game will crash after the opening cutscene. Doing this will skip the beginning and ending cutscene but the rest of the game should be fine

Thanks for the tip. This is one thing I am a little confused about. I've seen screen shots where people have RetroArch as a standalone item in their library they can launch. I haven't figured out how to add this. RetroArch isn't one of the parsers in Steam Rom Manager. The individual emulator cores in RetoArch are.

So how do you add RetroArch to your library and access it to adjust the settings you are talking about?

A lot of it was because I already had several emulation devices. I have a Raspberry Pi in a Mini-NES case running Emulation Station and several hand-held devices. Part of it was that I just didn't want risk messing something up on Steam Deck.

Yes, you are right emulating psp on a touch screen exclusively would not be a good experience. But luckily I have physical buttons to push.

10 years ago I have played through Persona 3 Portable  2-3 times. Since then I've played Mana Khemia through 2 times. I played several other JRPGs, and several Pokemon games (yeah, not psp, ds).

Portable gaming for me means portability and playing anywhere, anytime, no special preparations required, during commuting, standing, sitting etc. My Switch, which I quite like, barely qualifies for some of that, for me the Deck which I also quite like, absolutely does not.

My phone however does, and always have.

jhyx24e,Games like rimworld,SteamDeck
jhz17rm,"I love my steam deck, and part of the major reasons why is because of the insane power of controller configuration that's afforded by the trackpads. I never thought I would be able to play rimworld, factorio, CK3, CIV6, starbound, project zomboid, kenshi, any of these games any more in a handheld form factor, but just customizing the controls for 10-15 minutes makes all the difference in the world.

Even for FPS games, simply setting hotkeys with the left thumbpad as a touch radial menu is a complete game changer and I can't imagine going back to NOT using these....

For CK3/ Rimworld/ CIV, i have the left trackpad set to automatic hotkeys for all of the most used pages. Its' WAY easier than scrolling around with the right trackpad to click on things. It's even easier compraed to full mouse and keyboard because literally nobody can rememebr all of the hotkeys...

I've even made myself action sets where I can hold down L4 and completely change what kind of touch menu the left thumbpad is. Extremely useful for different map layers like in CK3

I would be a LOT more excited for the ROG ally if it had trackpads. Unfortunately I think you can only play xinput games on this thing, which is a damn shamed because while that's cool and all, there's way more games I wanna play beyond just controller games...

However, I'm still thrilled that the steam deck is showing manufacturers that there big market for PC handhelds (and gaming handhelds in general tbh beyond just the switch) and honestly, as gaming consumers we stand to ALL benefit from this. If more developers know that being able to be played comfortably on a handheld screen is a major selling point, then steam deck owners benefit as well (namely in optimization, UI scaling, etc).

I hope the ASUS ROG Ally sells extremely well even though I have no intention of getting one myself.

I feel like I am avoiding games that would take advantage of them because I really don't want to go through the learning curve, and I'm happy to stick to games in my backlog that are optimized for consoles and controllers.

I know eventually I will have to bite the bullet and really try at some point, but not until I can get a good experience and motivation to push through the learning curve.",SteamDeck
jhz9984,"As an example, I recently started playing Sacred 2 on the Deck.

I use the right trackpad for mouse movement.

The left trackpad does a lot of work though:

In the default action set, it is set to Directional Swipe, with each direction changing to an action set that has the left trackpad use a different radial menu until it is no longer touched, at which point it reverts to the default action set:

* Left swipe's menu switches between the 5 weapons.
* Right swipe's menu binds to the 5 combat arts (skills/spells).
* Upward swipe's menu binds to 6 assignable potions plus a health potion.
* Downward swipe's menu accesses UI stuff (character, inventory, combat arts, world map, log book).

Definitely something that takes some getting used to, though.",SteamDeck
jhzcb04,"Everything. Basically I always map the left trackpad to a 4-button cross with custom assignments; and add a button chord if I want more. Often I will even map up/down to mouse scroll, and left/right to some other functions. Right trackpad is always mapped to Mouse most times with press being left-click.

It’s effortless to just use the trackpads when needed for precision clicks or the UI in certain games. Much faster is many cases.

In other games, I will create a virtual menu for the trackpads with various functions. Like when I am using the Yuzu emulator, I created a Virtual menu with all the commands. In Elder Scrolls online I have a Virtual Menu on each trackpad, while still also being able to use the right trackpad as a Mouse/Click when I hold L5.

It is also a game changer in Real Time Strategy games as you can assign the trackpad to correlate to the minimap section *(of the screen)* specifically when your finger is on it.

Steam Input’s configuration essentially makes those two trackpads into Chads. I cannot even begin to consider using a handheld without those *(and the 4 back grip buttons)* anymore. It’s like a handicap being without them.",SteamDeck

jhz9q6l,"haha i absolutely hate trying to use the touchpads as analog sticks.... That has never felt good to me.

As far as I know every single game SHOULD support this (even non steam games!), since you're just simulating a keyboard press or something. I imagine even gamepad games would support if you want the touchpad to simulate an ""A"" press on a gamepad or something but not sure why you'd wanna do that. If you have a game that is strictly either CONTROLLER only or KEYBOARD only maybe you can only map inputs to whatever's been set, but this is pretty rare, most games are smart about taking in inputs.

You basically go into the settings->controller configurations and navigate to the touchpads, and you can choose for them to behave as ""touch menu"" or ""touch radial menu"". A very basic example of how to set this up is you know how in many FPS the guns can be quick selected by 1-9, or in an MMO like world of warcraft you have a ton of skills that you can access to 1-9?

Just go to set a touch menu, and have an input set as ""1"", then ""2"", and so on and so forth. Now when you just set your left thumb on the touchpad, a menu will show up with all of your inputs, just thumb over to what you want, press down, and you have that input. You can even name each one and even set tiny cute little images for each thing (i love doing this for FPS games, cute little pictures of shotguns, pistols, rocket launchers, etc). This is WAY better than what most shooters on controller do, which is either just slowly tabbing through every gun, or basically a hard pause and select whatever you want, the left thumbpad affords near instantaneously/ seamless switching. You can even customize color, opacity, menus size, position, haptic feedback, etc.

Take this to the next level with something like Crusader Kings 3. Realm, Military, Council are F1 through F whatever, let's set a touch menu that lets you access them immediately, versus having to awkwardly pan up with the mouse clicker. But there's SO many other hotkeys in this game, right? Namely stuff like Map layers, based on de jure kingdoms, religions, cultures. You'd get a pretty damn crowded touchpad with all of these hotkeys! No worries, set an action layer. Basically what an action layer is is you press a button (for example, L4), and while holding this down, it changes the inputs of something to something completely different. Create a new action layer for the left thumbpad called ""Map Mode"", and hotkey the map modes you want. Now you can use the left thumpad for general gameplay to thumb through the standard pages, or hold the L4 to do the same but for map modes. Insanely easy, and honestly EASIER to use (since you can have written down + an image of what actual hotkeys you're selecting) than a keyboard since nobody can remember any of those anyway.

Don't even get me started to how you can pair the capacitive touch of the joysticks to allow multiple actions at once. Like for kenshi, you have to hold down control to pan the camera around in the 3d plane. kind of annoying, right? Just make the ""right thumbstick touch"" to ""Control"" and you can now use the right thumbstick as a 3d Camera....

You can even program inputs as ""swipes"" or ""double taps"" or ""long press"" or ""hold"" it's insane. Imagine swiping up on the left thumpad to simulate a ""mouse scroll up"" to let you dynamically and smoothly zoom in and out (add in a turbo press for some zing) in a 4X game....

All of this is not very well described by valve, and for good reason too. You can almost do anything with the amount of controller configuration at your fingertips, and if valve dumped a massive tutorial on new players it would be terrifying/ overwhelming. (The PC world guide above is a good start). I have no doubt the majority of people are happily just chugging along playing their standard xinput controller games but man, learning about the controller configuration and spending 10-15 minutes in some games just making the game play more smoothly is so worth it, has made me love the device like, 10 fold more than before.

Which is why I think the ROG Ally isn't gonna be a buy from me, simply since it's just basically a simple xbox controller. Which is fine for SOME games, but there is an entire galaxy of games that simply won't work on the device, and that's a damn shame.",SteamDeck

[https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam\_controller/touch\_menus](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/touch_menus)

The menu shows up onscreen when you put your thumb on the touchpad, and you can see what option you're selecting. They're great for games with a ton of inputs.

I find a 3x3 grid works best, and I mostly use it to bind 1-9 for games with an action bar along the bottom to select tools/weapons.

EmuDecks focus seams to be broad and make it work on as many OS as possible. While ours is more narrow and only focusing on providing a deeper emulation experience inside the application itself when you use it. 

RetroDECK is focusing on the ease of having one application that you can just install and don't need to maintain any others.
Our scope is to provide a solution that once it's installed on your system you just need to update in inside the normal software update channels (Discover). 
We are also trying to bring more and expanded functionality inside the fully integrated RetroDECK framework that goes across all emulators.  

Just grab your games and play, no other configuration is needed as it's everything already bundled (except the actual roms and bios). But for the hardcore users we are planning more functions that no one else does for ease of tweaking and other secret things (wait for 0.7b!),",SteamDeck
jhwl8n0,"RetroDECK is an contained integrated application that gives you a single ES-DE interface where you can browse and play emulated games. 
Every emulator is bundled, tweaked and optimized for being used on the Steam Deck (and later other SteamOS devices and Linux Desktop). 

We are aiming to the simplicity for the user: put your roms and bioses and just play without having the need to configure anything. 

For the more experienced users however we are providing a tool named the RetroDECK Configurator that gives you access to all the single emulators, configurations and customization tools. 

In the next version (actually on the ""cooker"" preview channel) we will have a seamless experience with the hotkeys: forget which emulator you're using, it will have the same hotkeys and expanded functions can be accessed from a radial menu during the game-play.

Just remember, if you're on PC you can use the standalone versions or Steam, but when buying additional content it HAS TO BE on the same version. So you can't use Steam expansions with the standalone and vice versa. Don't know why, that's just how it is.

For making gil, you're not going to for quite a while (gotta finish the campaign and get into expansions) but crafting is generally where it's at. Thankfully you don't have too many expenses as you're levelling though, but some of the gear on the AH will be enticing for how it looks. Just sell any decent gear drops on the AH that you don't need as people looking for quick purchases while levelling alts will often buy things rather than take the time to earn them, and you'll sometimes have something useful for a glamour.

Until you're way further in the game, don't worry about it too much as you're going to be changing gear frequently and it won't help to be burning your Gil on stuff you'll soon get rid of.

Also 4k has been a cancer for storage space, about 0.5% of gamers have a 4k supported TV or PC yet ALL gamers have to download 50-80 GB of game data for those unnecessary 4k assets. 

I’d rather play an indie game that’s actually fun than another “generic AAA game 3: deluxe edition 90gb”


Triple A gaming is DEAD. Corporate america killed it. There hasn’t been any good games since ps3 era and the abundance of remasters proves this. There are still international and japanese developers making decent games like Nier, mario etc and these games are usually under 30gb in size due to the devs actually treating the games as art as opposed to another product. 


Publishes became too rich and have too much control now for AAA games. You can today find indie games that look better and play better, and are infinitely more fun and orignal than the same rehased bullshit you see with all these big developers.

I’ll never get jedi order unless it’s on the seven seas. That’s my rule for all AAA games going forward. If it’s not free, i’m not getting it. I’ll happily buy stardew valley for the 3rd time tho, and any other indie games i like. I bought steelrising for $40 and it’s one of my most played games on deck, i’m fine if nobody plays it it’s asouls like game anyway and i don’t like games that everyone is playing anyway because they’re usually shite like cyberpunk or gotham knights",SteamDeck

jhtkxt0,"Yes!! Doom on the steam deck is my new favorite way to play it. I have ZDL as a non-steam app, made the left trackpad a mouse cursor so I can navigate the program and add wads and mods. Then launch it and use controller settings. I love it.",SteamDeck
jhvf4ai,"I used  Luxtorpeda from ProtonUp-QT to run doom, and it includes many doom ports including GZdoom and (my favorite) DSDA. DSDA works well with controllers and you can even play MANY other old school games that have linux ports with it like: Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolf3D, quake, quake2, quake 3, doom 3, duke3D, Ion Fury, Star Wars Jedi knight games and tons more. And since it's running native, I find it uses very little wattage, runs silky smooth, and looks better. It also seems that Luxtorpeda even sets up controller support, but I could be wrong there, but from my testing I didn't have to fiddle with much of anything. Just set the compatibility layer to Luxtorpeda, run the game, it downloads and installs the ports and starts the game up flawlessly. (Big props to the Luxtorpeda team). The only thing I spotted that was meh, was Ion Fury doesn't sync saves. But I'm cool with that with how well it runs.",SteamDeck

jhvdvub,"If I could make a suggestion, instead of a long press you could do a normal press with two cycle commands.

jhtx1pv,"Without giving to much personal info away online, I'm definitely no spring chicken myself. I felt like I probably wasn't doing it right for the longest time with flick-stick, but it just takes time to adjust, and I understand if you don't think it's worth it. 

Personally, I think the jump in accuracy from normal right stick look to right stick look with gyro assist is a bigger jump and way easier to adjust to. Flick-stick will improve response time and accuracy even a bit more than gyro alone, but at the cost of a sharp learning curve. Flick-stick also requires settings that have to be tuned on a per game basis.",SteamDeck
jhxqmk4,"Interesting! I already use Luxtorpeda for Quake 2 and Descent 1/2, and in Quake’s case it lets me choose an engine from a launch menu each time.

jhx1g8k,"Good question!

I have noticed a difference in input. 
Things like I playing csgo with a keyboard and mouse, in desktop it worked as a pc, in game mode somehow the mouse was acting as a joystick.",SteamDeck
jhx6kon,"The two big differences are:

* They  use two different compositors. Game Mode uses gamescope (wayland) and Desktop Mode uses X11. That may account for your graphical glitches since gamescope is from Valve and X11 is the base Linux compositor.
* There is an overall mouse control overlay in Desktop Mode. I believe there are actually 2 layers to this. One is the more functional that works while you have Steam running. If you close Steam, then you'll get the basic one that only has touchpad movement and left/right click via the triggers.

That last one is one to watch out for since you could accidentally override your desktop controls by messing with controls within a game and you'll either have to plugin keyboard/mouse or reboot to get out of it.",SteamDeck
jhx6mpl,"They use different display servers. Desktop mode uses x, which is older and has wider support. Game mode uses Wayland which is newer, has better performance (usually), slightly worse support for somethings, and has built in vsync. Some of the deck's features like capping frame rate use tools that only work in Wayland.

Some games that don't run well in game mode are having issues with the built in vsync, and will run better if you ""enable screen tearing"" in the deck's performance menu.",SteamDeck

Division 2 is a great squad-based *(and solo)* looter/shooter game. Star Wars Battlefront 2/1 also works great. I believe the Halo Master Chief collection also works on SteamOS now also. Overwatch can also be run on SteamOS.

If the game you pick needs Windows because of anti-cheat software, you can always setup Windows on a MicroSD and boot into that for those select games.

jhvynn5,"Depending on what version you buy, the $40 ($20 on sale usually) version includes all 6 games (including the 2 remasters for CE and 2; CEA and 2A), but you can also buy them piece-meal for $5 each (also here if you buy CE or 2 you also get CEA or 2A, respectively)

The most popular multiplayer versions are 3, 2, Reach and CE (1), in that order. The only one that isn’t very popular for online play is 4 (and ODST, but that’s basically a DLC for 3 and never had MP to begin with)

All 6 run very well on PC seeing as they’re all more than a decade old. The remasters (CE Anniversary and 2 Anniversary) are a bit more taxing, but the CE remaster isn’t good anyway (they ruined the art style) so shouldn’t be played. The only good version that’s hard to run is the remaster of 2, which isn’t ideal for the Steam Deck. 

Keep in mind for multiplayer that there is a 2A filter, which isn’t in the same engine as the 2A campaign. 2A’s multiplayer runs in 4’s engine, and plays very differentely to the original 2 multiplayer. For this reason, it’s not very popular in multiplayer.",SteamDeck

When I Searched for the game on the website I got these results and the game I am looking for is indeed about halfway down. [https://www.steamgriddb.com/search/grids?term=Apocalypse+staring+bruce+willis](https://www.steamgriddb.com/search/grids?term=Apocalypse+staring+bruce+willis)

But When I srcrubbed for art in Steam Rom Manager it only showed the first eight or so entries from that list. How can I get it to show the whole list? The art I want is there. Would it help if I rename the rom to match the entry on Steam Grid: Apocalypse (1998)?",SteamDeck

thats odd. maybe your router has some kind of ""allow list"".  
 if so, most likely based on mac-adresses enabled as a kind of security feature so no unknown devices can log in. 

depending on the GUI of the router they could name that anything... whitelist, allow-list, allowed-devices ... something of that sort.

maybe browse through the settings or google the model together with ""mac adress"" *(You probably know, but it's the unique adress of a wifi device looking like a bunch of numbers and letters like: fe80::3039:769c...)* 

the ""disabled"" bit could also point to a setting on the deck. but this then should be the same for other wifi's as well. there'd be different approaches to this, depending on the ""root cause"".",SteamDeck

However, I have found a workaround. If you set it to run in compatibility/w GE proton 7-55, it works.

The game seems to think there's an update of some kind needed. I've tried disabling the DLC (I only have the first one) to see if it has somethijg to do with that.

I've also messed with my cloud save data (thought I wiped it for a moment there) and putting the system in offline mode to kill whatever it's trying to download, but no luck.

If it's unclear, you go to launch the game in game mode, it shows you the controller config it will be using, and then says ""downloading content 0%"" (I did try switching controller layouts in case it was somehow downloading one). 

Running in desktop mode makes it clear the ""downloading"" is for a game update because it opens a little window with the ""launch game when ready"" option. But, you go to downloads and nothing is there and it never budges from 0%.",SteamDeck

jhvim2g,"It's not placebo and it's simply because the delay between when the frame is ready and when it is shown will be shorter at 60Hz than at 40Hz. Technically the longest it could have to wait at 60Hz is 1/60s=16ms, while at 40Hz it's 1/40s=25ms. That's enough of a difference to be noticeable. If you enable allow tearing and you mostly care about what's in the middle of the screen (in a FPS for example), then that should cut that delay in half but 60Hz would still be better.

However 40FPS/60Hz won't give you a constant input delay and it won't look smooth, that's why people recommend 40FPS/40Hz instead.",SteamDeck
jhw5che,"that's incorrect. if your game is running, say, at a solid 60 fps, and your refresh rate is 40 Hz, then the delay chain looks like this:

input -> up to 16 ms lag -> frame gets rendered -> between 0 and 8 ms lag -> frame gets displayed

this 0-8 ms lag is additional due to 40 Hz not lining up with 60 fps, and the fact that it's random makes it even worse because now the lag is random and this feels way crappier than longer lag that's always a fixed amount.",SteamDeck

When at 40hz the fps limiter changes from 15/30/60 to 10/20/40, meaning even if you leave the limiter on 60fps when you change to 40hz it'll automatically change to a 40fps. In order to get a 60fps limit you'd need to turn off the limiter, enable ""allow tearing"" to turn off the system vsync, then *also* turn off the game's own vsync, then use in-game settings to limit the fps to 60 (or turn off the limit).

jhsay94,"Steam Deck is just a PC and PC always had the potential to be more adopted. The reason it wasn't is because PC in handheld form factor wasn't achieveable nor was it sought out. But most importantly; hardware companies sell CPUs and GPUs in massive bulks at low cost to Sony and Microsoft but sell equivalent parts at much higher price to DIY market. As result you're looking at minimum 500$ for a portable mini itx PC.

If all conditions were met, close to as cheap APUs for DIY as for consoles (e.g 15%  more expensive), you could build a mini itx APU build and it would be portable. It wouldn't kill consoles but it would be an amazing (open system; mods and emulation) and respectable (cost effective as consoles) gaming system.

There is also a misconception that because PC UI is somehow not user friendly because it's not as streamlined as a console. The fact is PC has mouse and keyboard and is easy to use with those. Consoles didn't or had limited K/M support, as result UI designers streamlined it, which is exactly why Deck has such UI too (for when you're using its controls not K/M).",SteamDeck

While I've had very few issues with Bluetooth controllers (especially on the Deck), it's the fastest solution that most people tend to be fine with and games will have zero problem recognizing with zero tweaks.

They aren't my favorite controllers for gameplay, but when you want to get a 4 player game rolling in seconds instead of several minutes, (and trust me, people do become impatient), just go with the easy route. Controllers and adapter will last you for years if you aren't particularly cruel to them, rechargeable batteries are easy to come by (just get the nice IKEA ones, they're within less than the margin of error for performance compared to Eneloops and they're a fraction of the price. The wall chargers they come with are great no-fuss chargers. As a backup I keep both a charger and a pack of dollar store alkaline batteries around in my bag as well).",SteamDeck

jhoqww3,"I've only tried the joycons with Yuzu so I can't say vouch for other games. Here's my experience:

The joycon initial pairing seems good at first but always have trouble pairing after SD go to sleep and wake up. I don't have this issue with my DS4 controller at all and it will reconnect 100% of the time. In split mode, it's a 50/50 chance to get the joycon to reconnect on wakeup and I have to fiddle with the sync button for a minute or two. It's random and unreliable.

During gameplay you MUST turn off all rumble feature. This can be a hassle since you might have to look into disabling it in both the SD menu and in the game menu to be sure. For some reason, the rumble data can oversaturate the Bluetooth bandwidth and cause signal to drop. Others have experience weak BT range but I haven't experience this issue so YMMV. Also, even with rumble off, the joycon battery still don't last more than 45m~1hr on a full charge and will cut short any long party/co-op game session.

The joycon driver on SD and Linux is useable but imperfect and is more or less an imitation of mapped inputs on the Switch ported over. Without an official driver from Nintendo or until someone comes out with a better driver, there will always be BT connection and signal issues so it's hard to recommend using joycon with SD unless you're an enthusiast.",SteamDeck

Without an official driver from Nintendo or until someone comes out with a better driver, there will always be BT connection and signal issues so it's hard to recommend using joycon with SD unless you're an enthusiast.

I've looked at the driver that's in the linux kernel, valve is using their own userspace implementation.  
The issue is, joycons expect perfectly timed bluetooth packets that tell them the 3d rumble pattern, which is in term used as a keepalive pattern, basically telling them to stay on and keep sending inputs.  
On the switch this driver (I'm guessing here) is running in a way that ensures that timing and prioritizes this. On linux this is way harder, since the bluetooth stack doesn't enforce this timing well enough, also the timeout when the kernel decides a controller has disconnected is far to long, so the controller and kernel sometimes have different opinions on the paring status, which will cause a re-pair (which would happen on the next button press on the controller) to just fall on it's face.  
Also the implementation of the controller numbering is fairly broken, so sometimes controllers can loose it's number when re-paring.  
  
I've thought about trying to rewrite the driver with the community knowledge on github, but I didn't quite get around to doing it (and don't have any linux driver dev knowledge lol).",SteamDeck

From what I've read, Nintendo went through a few revision for the joycons so you might just have an earlier model that play nicer with w/e latest driver the kernel is using.",SteamDeck

Let me explain:

This error is caused by a broken wine prefix (usually).
Delete the ~/.xlcore/wineprefix folder.
On   the deck, you need to go into desktop mode, open the file browser, and   enable show hidden files. Then click the home icon on the left, open  the  .xlcore folder, and delete wineprefix.

Once you do   this, launch XIVLauncher again and log in normally.

The game might crash/freeze once, but WINE will come up and detect missing files.

After that, you run the launcher, it will hold at “ensuring  compatibility tool” and stay there for a while. You switch to the other open window of FF XIV and install the wine prefix pop up, and FIXED!

Then add the CEMU.exe to Steam as a non-Steam game. Add a compatibility layer to your CEMU Steam shortcut via settings, proton experimental should work, or 7.0.4. then launch the shortcut, it should load. You'll need to add your controller via the CEMU controller settings panel and bind the inputs, you can check YouTube for tutorials on that, but it's fairly straight forward. 

Then go to graphics packs for your BOTW rom and set it up as recommended via YouTube. Launch it, it will have to load shaders for a good while. It should run... 

This is how I play the game, not via emudeck, but via a CEMU folder I carried over from my PC.

As for how to learn this? I learned after switching to Linux in 2019, but if you're only accustomed to Windows, it'll be a learning curve. Just start out easy and tackle one game at a time, when one works, set out on another, if one doesn't work just take a breather and try again later.",SteamDeck

you need to install proton GE on your steam deck and you’ll have ultimate comparability with all windows games. Only anti cheat games like fortnite don’t work and that’s more because of Tim Swennys micro penis than the steam decks hardware.

I have over 20 hours in (the first 10 hours we’re figuring out how the game actually works) and I still haven’t beat biome 2 but that’s because those damn Severed eventually catch up to me. Not because of the frame rate. 

I can’t speak to what performance is like in the late game or tower gameplay, but my unpopular opinion based on my limited progress is it’s 100% worth the full price purchase depending on how valuable $60 is to you. 

You can take it very far with reconfiguring the game engine settings file and reduce the game to play on a potato and you can keep your average frame rate well above 30. I found keeping the factory low settings and 70% render scaling to be the best experience in either handheld or docked.",SteamDeck

I didn't think I would enjoy this game at all at anything under 60 FPS, but I think I could sit down and play through the whole game on the Deck if I wanted to the way that it runs now, but I've also been locking every graphically-demanding game like this to 30 FPS on the Deck, so maybe I'm just used to that speed now.

It looks great but ultimately it's an adventure on rails with never too much happening on screen at any given time. And yet CPU and GPU going crazy. Maybe I'm just cynical, these games designed for 6 year old hardware don't run well unless you're on a PC from the last 3 years or so.",SteamDeck
jhryues,"VSync was on in the in-game settings.

ji1ium8,"Yeah, I think it's worth it. One note, though: Unless I'm going nuts, I think the latest update (the one that added DLSS 3 for desktop Nvidia cards) actually made it play worse on the Deck than the version that was live a couple of days ago, so you might have to adjust settings accordingly.",SteamDeck

You certainly raise a good point. I usually don't *really* mind a perfect 30 FPS cap, especially for third-person games, but I genuinely found Returnal unplayable on my end. Kudos to you for wrapping it up at 30, though!",SteamDeck
jhs90is,My logic still applies ironically lol. The PS5 can run doom eternal at 120fps. So you shouldn't expect better than 60 on the deck.,SteamDeck

Having played TLOU on an i9-13900KS/4090 system max 4k settings, it's pretty freaking impressive looking, way better I think than Returnal at the same settings.

Again, my point was that these two PS 5 only games didn't seem to port well. haven't ported well for mid and lower speced system. Returnal's PC hardware requirements draw a lot of attention because they seemed high to a lot of people.",SteamDeck
jhqsvfe,Well one thing that has happened is that Nvidia in their totally consumer wisdom made sure that all of their cards have very little RAM compared to AMD cards. Hardware Unboxed just did a video proving that if the 3070 had more VRAM it wouldn't be struggling so much with new games. They used a quadro equivalent card that even has lower clock speeds but has 16GB of RAM and it was a huge difference. So the company that everyone buys is artificially limiting your performance. Thanks Nvidia!,SteamDeck
jhr9lrq,"I totally agree. Remember TLOU was actually a PS3 game & both the PS4 revised AND the new PS5 TLOUpt1 which is ""built from the ground up"" has the exact same issues & bugs that the original game had albeit with better graphics. I have all 3 versions.

jhsq5yh,"They haven't scaled well to lower hardware, no. But consider that thought. You've got a few grands worth of PC parts in just GPU and CPU. These are PS5 games, but the hardware you're rocking represents massive generational leaps in performance over what's in the PS5. It's fairly well reported that comparable hardware doesn't get close to even PS5 performance. 2070s/80s struggling to match PS5 visuals in TLoU. These games, by their nature, should scale well considering they were designed with 5 year old hardware in mind. It's not exactly like the PS5 was cutting edge at the time of release. These are bad ports, not just on lower end hardware. 4090s can run the game, from what I've seen, at native 4k, no upscaling while swallowing up north of 18gb of vram and >20gb of system memory. These games were designed for systems with far less impressive system resources. This isn't a case of poor performance on the lower end, that's poor performance at all price points.",SteamDeck
jhsk9ix,"I'm not sure about that, but I can try it and let you know.

EDIT: It seems like the frame rate did actually stabilize even more doing this, but it added a pretty noticeable lag to the controls.",SteamDeck
ji2et7d,"Yeah, that's the one that worked really well on the Deck for me, and you obviously don't need DLSS 3 on the Deck, anyway. I don't think that update added anything gameplay wise. I believe it should be manifest 9040347422599518007 on SteamDB.",SteamDeck
jhsqtzl,I've watched a few videos of 6950s playing the game at 100fps but at 1080 while still utilizing 13gb. That still seems nuts for 1080.,SteamDeck
jhsu0ow,"I get what you are saying but the PS 5 has specialized hardware for decompressing textures, the GPU streaming DirectStorage like capability that isn't employed on the PC for this game plus whatever else the game uses that's tied to the PS 5 hardware.

Consoles have long been accused of holding PCs back. We've just hit a spot with where they actually are kind of pushing the ahead. Like the issue with 8 GB cards particularly ones from nVidia that are being held back by lack of VRAM.

And we are seeing more and more games do this. PCs just need more resources to keep up at the mid-range in particular. Call it unoptimized, bad porting, etc. but almost all of these AAAs need more than just couple of years ago.

True, and they can't touch something like an i9-13900KS/4090 setup either at 4k. Throw in DLSS upscaling, a tech only on PCs with nVidia hardware, and they blow console performance away with well over 100 FPS 4k max settings. Upscaled but DLSS quality is so good it hardly matters visually, it's just something a console can't do.

Yes, that's a lot of hardware to brute force through the issues, but that's kind of what high-end PC gaming has been about.",SteamDeck

With mode-shifting and a click-activated button menu, you can actually assign a different input for the center and each corner of the trackpad. I tested this in Ion Fury and it worked well without any accidental unintended corner presses. I plan on doing a little video tutorial on it soon. Granted, I used it for weapon selection and not common actions like jumping. Still, it could reasonably make up for the lost back paddles.

jhy0hwg,I was in the mountains with no way to install third party software. Every PC operating system I've used in the past decade and a half has come bundled with a video player. I was surprised when this OS didn't and I had no way to put one on it when I needed one.,SteamDeck

They don't have every feature possible listed in the marketing. I don't know why you think that's a thing. There's no text editor mentioned in the marketing, but the Steam Deck comes with vim because a text editor is a common OS feature. It also comes with an image viewer, so I assumed it came with a video player too. If it only came with a terminal and a Desktop Environment, I'd be on your side here.

I've had display, sound, charging, keyboard problems, and my browser crashed four times trying to watch one video. A system restart fixed that, but it was still annoying.

I've been docking my deck a lot more recently because my son likes to watch me play some sonic games, and i didn't have a single issue for the past couple months or so in terms of display. No charging issues either, except the battery % glitch that i fixed with putting it in storage mode, and restarting(This happened a year ago).

No keyboard/ browser issue either. i often use the browser mode to watch netflix when I'm at work, or docking it to watch something on the big tv when my chromecast is acting up.

But that's kind of irrelevant insofar as that first bit there...

Being a ""steam fan"" has nothing to do with my understanding of Linux and how it works. That's just the reality of the OS; it's something I have followed personally and professionally for 20+ years now.

Some developers choose to keep linux compatibility closed on anti-cheat software largely because it cannot get it's hooks deep into the operating system like it does with Windows; making it much easier to circumvent.

They are left with two options; enable linux for an extremely marginal playerbase and get very little profit for it and deal with the increased costs of dealing with the cheaters (both in terms of man hours and in terms of relations with their clients) or keep linux disabled and still retain 99.5% of their marketshare.

It is a business decision not a preference one.

Your expectation of the 512gb model is simply that... an expectation. They never advertised it as coming with windows so there's no reasonable expectation for that.

You are correct in that pricing and features of the deck has nothing to do with the devs... That's not relevant to compatibility.

Your commentary on Valve caring about running things from their store is misplaced and misguided. 

Valve already has a near monopoly for PC gaming on windows, that's not why they chose to ship with SteamOS.

I speculate it has more to do with the costs of licenses that would get passed on to consumers plus shipping with windows means additional paperwork as they have to include Microsoft in all of their distribution plans.

Though, have you considered just using the dock you already have and getting a cheap, possibly used, controller instead? Trying to game with a deck + dock on your belly seems like it would be unwieldy. It sounds like you want to game on a TV, you already have a dock, a cheap xbox controller would give you similar buttons to the Deck while letting you use it docked without having to drive yourself crazy with extension cords.

Alternatively you could go with a right angle adapter or one of those 180 back adapters. The problem with right angle adapters isn't that they're angled per se, it's that they are another middleman in between the power supply and the Deck, and you can't be sure that said middleman meets USB-PD standards and knows how to negotiate power properly. If you get a decent one you should be fine.

jhxyduw,"I’ve got a Deck and an OG launch Switch, the Deck is hands down the superior handheld in every way to me, the Switch feels like a joke toy console after using my Deck for the last 6 months.

I agree it’s not that portable, but I feel like it’s just as portable as the Switch.

Both require a special case to actually safely bring it anywhere, both are going to require a charge after a few hours, both play in the same handheld orientation.",SteamDeck
jhxz2s2,"Never had issue with portability.
Enjoy your oled switch if It suit your needs.",SteamDeck
jhy3l5t,Ok,SteamDeck
jhxz2xf,Sounds like you’d just be better off with a traditional console. Your expectations for what a portable gaming device can or should do are a little off. Personally I’ve been absolutely blown away that I can even run AAA games at all. 30 fps 720p is totally acceptable for me considering the form factor they are being played in.,SteamDeck
jhy68d4,This sounds more like a “make myself feel better about my questionable decisions post.”   Lol.  But I have been there.,SteamDeck
jhxxzou,"I get where you are coming from and no product is for everyone.

I would caution you against asserting what other people do and think; for example I literally carry my deck to work in my bag every weekday, stream music during my workday and play games on my lunch break; I have a dock dedicated for my work desk so I don't need to bring anything but the deck itself.",SteamDeck
jhy04t6,"Never really had a problem playing a lot of AAA games @ 30 fps with settings modified.

You can manage to run demanding games for around 2~2:30 hours generally.

If you’re expecting games to “just work”, Steam Deck isn’t for you. It’s a PC in handheld form. You always need to tweak.

It is interesting to hear about lack of portability compared to the Switch though. I don’t honestly see the difference in portability.",SteamDeck
jhy57o3,"I waited before I bought the SD, but did not for Switch. 

Switch joycon is weak especially the thumbstick and I fix it myself. I go the 1st gen first release Switch and mine was a little warped with drifting. 

SD, I did not experience any even after I open it up and switch the SSD. I feel comfortable with the SD thumbstick over Switch. Actually their Switch-lite feels better than the orig first release Switch.

I never find the appeal for OLED so without it don't bother me.

I don't play multiplayer and if I want to play AAA, I'll either play them on my desktop or console. 

I actually hooked up the battery while gaming and I have not charge the SD since the first charge only charge the battery bank. ( I also have a few powerbank as of now, I have not run out of battery yet cos while 1 charging, I can just hooked up another one. )

for $400 ( only paid extra $60 for the 512 gb ssd and I have a lot of the SD card already due to tablets. I don't see myself having tons of games downloaded and I delete games once I am done ), I also get the hard casing for protection, I already felt it's worth. 

So overall for me, it is a good experience.",SteamDeck
jhyfjzc,"This highlights how different people's perceptions can be. When I got my steam deck i was skeptical of if it could replace my gaming PC with much better specs. However, after getting it for the past 2 months I have not played a single game on my PC and have had no desire to. I have played AAA games from Days gone to Spider-Man remastered as well as Hogwarts legacy, all of which ran acceptably well where if I didn't have the FPS counter on I wouldn't even know what FPS it was running at.

 I take this thing everywhere with me when I go somewhere. I know I'm going to be away from the house for an hour. I take it with me. I take it on walks and sit on a park bench for an hour while playing it looking over a lake. 

The battery life honestly amazes me sure out of the box you're going to get an hour and a half on most AAA games. Haven't seen lower than that myself and if you were to fiddle with it I was able to get both days gone and Spider-Man remastered to last 3 and 1/2 to 4 hours on a full charge locked to 30fps. On lighter games like vampire survivors I can push it to 8 hours.

 Perception is key and it's really hard to know how much you're going to like something or how much somethings going to bother you without trying it yourself. You could be like this person who's found fault in very many aspects of the steam deck. Or you could think wow, this is an amazing machine and I can't believe it exists.",SteamDeck
jhykdf5,Okay,SteamDeck
jhy2lfi,"I was reading your points and I agree somewhat:

The deck is not totally portable, it’s a bit unwieldy, I ended up buying a small stand to take some of the pressure off my hands while playing games. The case does not help its “heft” as its bulky, adding more bulk to the unit. It is a gaming unit, so i kinda get the weight behind it, but i am glad I purchased the stand.

Games seem to run okay for me (mostly), but getting to play them seems to be a bit of a challenge. I spend more time updating them, than actually playing them sometimes.

The constant patches/shader caches/optimisation updates seem to be nearly every day. It also doesn’t seem to like you copying games via the steam deck from another pc. On several occasions. (backed up on ssd). I have copied the entire game and yet Steam claims there is like 15gb missing and then proceeds to download them. If that were the case then my games on pc would have the same issue. On some games, it refuses to acknowledge they are even installed, but this bug seems pretty rare fortunately.

I found the screen to be okay for small play throughs, but I think I am so used to large play areas, it starts to grate on me after a while. I just end up plugging it back in to its dock.  I did like the touch screen aspect, but i found the linux interface a little lacking.

Battery Life was okay for me, it wasn’t super great, but I could play for around two hours on standard settings. I still had battery left too.

I never bothered with all the hype, They had so many preview restrictions for people to review the decks, it simply put me off till it had been available for a year before even thinking of purchasing it.

In terms of games, I havent really explored beyond the basic game setup, there are some glitches setting up some games, like the xbox sign in screen not appearing properly on the steam deck, (like it was almost impossible to sign in to play forza). But so far the games I have tried 3/5 have worked okay.

In terms of price, the unit for me is way overpriced, there simply is not enough storage for the unit unless you play minor games. Most A rated games now seem to end up around 100gb. I ended up upgrading the unit to 2tb to be able just to play my current setup in portable mode. Having to upgrade the unit so quickly after purchase was not something I had envisioned happening. (I upgraded it just fine, I had zero issues doing the on hands stuff. I had more issues with the actual steam recovery usb key. It is provided as is and is really buggy. it took three attempts to get to install properly and then it refused to update with another well known bug coming up (seems the wifi cards on some of these decks is really nasty)

I found the design to be okay, glad they put the vents up the top. Bulky but okay.

I found the deck also underwhelming due to its lack of storage and the steam OS issues. I had hoped this would be the portable gaming platform I was looking for, but It wasn’t so I replaced it with something that gave me the best of both worlds. In terms of whats next, the Rog Ally will work with my existing setup, so I am waiting for the reviews and pricing on that unit. It has similar specs, but the gpu passthrough makes it an interesting choice for serious portable gaming. (you get the best of both worlds).

That is how I found the unit, why i switched to something else.",SteamDeck

jhyq3ss,"Okay, I guess? Whatever floats your boat. I do not agree even on one single point. I just do not understand your arguments at all, because these are just not arguments for or against the Steam Deck at all.

I sold my Switch and got a Deck. Best decision ever. I use my Steam Deck EVERY SINGLE DAY for a few hours. Whereas my Switch would collect dust for months. I would only use it if a new game came out. Sometimes even half a year.",SteamDeck
jhyq4yj,"The Steam Deck is a tinkerer's device and everyone imagining it's a portable PS4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch Pro is just setting themselves up for disappointment. It's a PC. PC gaming requires a certain amount of tinkering and the more advanced the title the more true this becomes.

But the Deck's definitely portable. I'd argue anyone dismissing the ergonomics while talking up a Switch is being disingenuous.",SteamDeck
jhyqxlk,"Not portable?

That’s not some massive backpack either. It’s a [small fashionable sling bag](https://www.amazon.com/Dwenles-Crossbody-Waterproof-Daypack-Charging/dp/B09XQJDX61). And you can even see my chunky power bank and folding BT keyboard in there.

I don’t agree on the ergonomics. I find the deck to be very good. From where you grip rests, it fills your palms and you don’t have to adjust your grip to reach anything but the overlay buttons, even the trackpads. And I use the trackpads ALOT; for any game UI/navigation *(right trackpad)* as well as mapping the left trackpad as 4-way buttons and assigning extra functions. Steam Input essentially gives you like 10-20 extra buttons effortlessly.",SteamDeck
jhyt8jj,"Actually, taking it with me on the train is exactly what I do.",SteamDeck
jhyy5o6,"I honestly disagree with everything you just listed. I find it to be just as portable as the Switch. I can run AAA games if I want without many issues and I have an at home console if something doesn’t work as most people also do. The screen for me is fantastic and I have no complaints with it. Battery life is honestly about the same as the Switch especially if you lower the FPS and refresh which in my experience doesn’t mess with gameplay noticeably. For me $549 for a portable device with the ability to play lots of PC games without having to spend $2,000 on a gaming PC was more than well worth it. And lastly as far as hype and expectations go maybe people should just research first. It has far exceeded my expectations and when it first came out I completely ignored it. I didn’t order one until there were enough games I couldn’t get on console that I wanted to play. Plus add in the constant game sales and honestly I feel it’s a very good choice.",SteamDeck

jhz5ccp,"So here's my two cents. The old lid switch is garbage, it's old tech with a shiny new label on it.   

The steam deck while being old tech can run AAA games. Portability isn't about raw power if you want that just go get a fucking laptop with a 4080. That's even less portable but it'll play what you want but not without plugging in. 

Buy a battery for the SD it makes it infinitely more portable than a laptop especially while traveling. I live on the road 6 days a week and I can't always pop out my laptop but I can always pull out the steam deck I have a bag just for it and it's supplies I even have a nice little cable and a battery and I can play all day long almost 10 hours with a 25,000 ml amp battery.  

I myself have modded the crap out of my SD. Better joysticks( hall effect), better cooling, a better battery(an external 25,000 milliamp) , a snap-on fan with a stand, a nice dock so I can use it on the TV, and a Logitech k40 so I have a mouse and keyboard if I want to play faster than light.",SteamDeck
jhzdvw0,Fair enough.,SteamDeck
jhzgaom,I too wish it was more powerful.. and battery life is meh at best. It’s a great entry to pc type gaming on the go though. I will be picking up an Ally when they come out though.,SteamDeck

They are both just as portable since you'd want to put it in a protective case anyways (Deck comes with one, conveniently) so what dot are you connecting that I'm not seeing?

The SD does emulation up to Wii U and ps2 with some ps3. The ally will probably handle ps3 and yuzu better. But aside from that. The SD and the ally will be about the same for emulation. It's not like NDS games are going to work any better on either of them. You might be able to upscale a bit more on the ally, but in my experience, it just doesn't matter. 

Don't forget to add the price of an SD card into the equation too. A 1tb isn't negligible when deciding between the two. You might not need a card with the ally. 

The SD is an emulation beast. 

I currently have a 64gb SD with a 512 GB SD card with batocera installed. It works great. Ive been nothing but happy with the performance. I only wish I would've gotten a 1tb card. My entire collection is about 650gb, so it kinda sucks to just have a few missing.

jhw9j8j,i took all that into consideration. You wanna be in your bed and just open the damn game. Thats why windows will make it a little harder (but not impossible) what about the second hand market? did you check it out yet?

From the Gameboy to the Gameboy light to the 3ds to the vita and EVERYTHING in-between. Even the vmu from Sega and the PlayStation mini memory card unit. I had to get rid of all of it. Only thing I kept was a PSP go cause I needed to have at very minimum AT LEAST one way to play PSP natively. The only handheld I didn't have anymore was the Sega nomad and that's because I had already sold it about a year prior to The Big Sell (what I call it in my mind lol). All this is to say, out of everything I had to sell, I miss my vita the most. And I had some RARE bois. A few Japanese exclusive Gameboy color ways, a couple Japanese retailer exclusive GBA SP colors. I wish I didn't have to sell it all but as a married father bringing home our homes sole income trying to keep my wife and babies afloat, along with a few unforeseen circumstances like missing work due to a suicide in the family, being forced to miss work without pay BY MY JOB because I *may have* been exposed to somebody with covid at work, car trouble etc you name it etc eventually I was left with zero other options.

Did you at least get to photo document your collection? It sounds interesting!

Nothing rare though, just consoles I’ve bought and looked after over the years. I’d love to at least see some of the other consoles in person like the Nomad, Neo Geo Pocket, Wonderswan. Oh I did try a virtual boy for all of five minutes. I still can’t see straight. 😝",SteamDeck

jhn6djc,Yes! Best fighting game I’ve ever seen! Continuously updating over a decade!,SteamDeck
jhndz6z,Nope bro. It is a streaming from the deck!,SteamDeck
jhnk9gq,I don’t think they should be compared together? One is a powerful handheld PC the other is a pure handheld. Vita may be a failure of Sony but the homebrew community is awesome! You don’t really need a specific memcard anymore and there is a lot of things you can do like I was streaming from steamdeck via moonlight. And it is not that hard to set up nowadays deckwise you just need to install sunshine_x86_64.flatpak and follow some instructions you will be fine. If you want to stream on vita make sure you have forced software encoding in sunshine settings.,SteamDeck
jhnn9bg,They are! Sunshine is basically build for Moonlight,SteamDeck
jhz792l,"They are. One program *casts* the screen (like the sun casts its rays), the other program *reflects* that screen on a different device (like the moon reflects the sun's rays). I wasn't aware that you could get Moonlight on a Vita though. Guess the homebrew scene really is pretty solid.

I've only heard of people installing Sunshine on a powerful desktop PC and Moonlight on the Steam Deck, for playing things like Elden Ring at 60fps. Apparently Sunshine+Moonlight work better than Steam's own Remote Play, in a lot of cases.

Now I want to install Sunshine on my Deck and moonlight on my Chromebook (I just looked, there is a ChromeOS version) so I can play more games that make heavy use of the keyboard! Though I wonder if full keyboard and mouse input actually works or if it only supports controller input...  🤔",SteamDeck
jhqjlvk,Yes. Sunshine on Deck Moonlight on Vita,SteamDeck
jhqjojz,Definitely check it out!,SteamDeck
jhtcs0e,"There are some reasons: First, Vita version is a waterdown one that can’t even hit 544p. Second, Skullgirls on legacy platforms is outdated. We don’t have Annie, Umbrella and Black Dahlia on vita version. We can’t even crossplay between legacy platforms and moderns anymore. Last but not least, it is not just streaming, you can take advantage of all games that support couch play! Skullgirls is just one of examples I showed here.

The Vita doesn’t even have a top OLED panel and it’s screen is still miles better than the decks. Some games with lower settings on my Switch look better because of the OLED, than Steam Deck running at higher settings.",SteamDeck

jhx9z0a,"In the shot here it looks a bit more saturated. That's it. You literally can't tell screen quality from an image like this. I don't doubt the Vita might have a better image, but the post is just pandering to the ""Deck has a crap screen"" narrative.",SteamDeck
jhoc6w2,Haven’t used moonlight on deck. But with my experience on phone before. Moonlight would definitely be a better option. There’s also a Decky plugin that allows you stream your games more easily,SteamDeck

jhz59pc,"It says right in the title what's going on. Sunshine is a screen-casting/streaming server program, and Moonlight is the client program that connects to it. Basically, they're saying this game is running natively on the Deck and then being *streamed* into the Vita.",SteamDeck

jhoml8i,I am happy to wait a good 4 or 5 years before they drop another steamdeck tbh,SteamDeck
jhny38u,"I want a 1080p OLED panel, and for it to be a larger panel with smaller bezels, so overall it remains the same size. The refresh rate is fine - higher than 60hz on a handheld would be silly, but it's so strange that in 2023 the screen is 720p.",SteamDeck
jhp9slr,"Oled is usually a bit better than lcd in sunlight because of the way they're constructed. Oled is basically staring at the light source directly, while lcd has the backlight fighting against the sun for who is brighter. 

A good example is how old gameboys look good in the sun. They dont have a backlight, but a reflective panel that is used to illuminate the lcd, and the lcd blocks light both entering and exiting creating the picture.",SteamDeck

jhn5uxr,"The LCD Vita screen is no slouch either, mind you, especially after some homebrew tweaks",SteamDeck
jhxf1a6,"Sure, a lot of it is just saturation, but you can also clearly see that the Vita has markedly darker black levels, and the fine details have less color crushing in the lighter areas (like the bright tan/yellow trees in the far background). Vita had more blur while moving (early OLED tech suffered from pretty bad ghosting), and lower resolution, but even from a photograph you can see that the whole-screen contrast and the color depth is better on the Vita. Plus the temperature; it's no secret that the Deck trends more toward blues, and you can see the Vita has a redder tint in comparison.",SteamDeck
jhnnxl7,No idea sorry,SteamDeck
jhnqn6a,Fair enough. Good to know you can stream games. I modded my Vita but still have yet to add games. 🤷‍♂️,SteamDeck

jhnygne,"For smaller screens, 720p still looks really nice. As screens get bigger, resolution matters more.",SteamDeck

jho3wfu,1080p 20 fps,SteamDeck
jhrbjhx,">  higher than 60hz on a handheld would be silly

High refresh rates are needed for VRR to work properly, which is definitely something you want on a handheld. Doesn't mean you need to actually play at 120fps (although the option is there for lighter games).",SteamDeck
jhpn0yh,Also important can be the subpixel arrangement. The note 2 for example fared quite good even on 720 compared to smaller 720p phones like the s3 because it had a full rgb layout rather than some pentile or whatever stuff,SteamDeck
jhnmusp,"a bit of both, but if you compare it to the Nintendo DS, it contemporary at the time, it was fragile. You could drop the ds on purpose and keep on truckin’. You dropped the psp at its touch and go depending on the severity of the drop. the vita and even the psp go are stronger built on that regard.",SteamDeck

Doesn't beat unaged OLED, but in terms of bang for buck they are very well positioned in the TV market for a reason.",SteamDeck

jho3rd1,It looks better than SD LCD for sure.,SteamDeck

jhwp8ld,"Generally I agree with you, but I like playing older PC games too, and quite a few from the late 2000s don't play well with a horizontal resolution of 1280, expecting 1366x768 or better. I do like the 16:10 ratio, and understand why lower resolutions lead to better performance in general, but personally I'd like to replace that 1280x800 display with a 1440x900 one for the sake of compatibility with those older games. The 26% increase in pixels wouldn't be nearly as taxing for the GPU as trying to drive a full 1080p display, but still gets the horizontal rez up over 1366.

Also, while OLED would be amazing, I think they could get away with just an IPS screen that has better color accuracy, vibrance, and peak brightness than the terrible panel they have now (hopefully with good min brightness as well, though that's less important to me than to others).

Not officially, no, but it may be in the works as part of [this update](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Color-Steam-Deck), when it eventually rolls out to users.

In the meantime, you can [Generate a LUT](https://blog.checkyo.tech/2022/06/20/steam-deck-display-calibration/) yourself and apply it to games using [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) or [vkBasalt](https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt), but it doesn't apply to the system as a whole, takes a bit of work to use with each game, and there are certain games that won't work with it at all (rendering OpenGL games through [Zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html) might help, but there are still gaps in its coverage afaik). All that effort is not for the faint of heart, lol.

Alternatively, VibrantDeck can be set to control the red, green, and blue saturation values separately. Bumping the red and green up more than the blue might suffice for some people.",SteamDeck

But for older games and indie games - where the Steam Deck really shines, at least for me - the Steam Deck can handle those easily at 1080p60.

Xbox One S: 720p 10-30fps often going below 30

PS4: 900p dynamic resolution. 10-30 fps often going below 30. Almost always below 30 in combat.

Pc equivalent settings: Looks to be a mix of medium-low.

PS4 pro: 1080p 30 fps often drops below 30.

Xbox one X: 1440p 30 fps with occasional dips as low has 19.

From this the steam deck is performing closer to the PS4 pro than the base consoles.

Either case, it's difficult to compare since last gen console's CPU's were absolute junk, even the pro and one x.

This debate is over,  the steamdeck would be objectively better than the Base PS4 at 1080p, combined with FSR, no contest.",SteamDeck
jhvas12,"The ps4 pro has a better processor and a better graphics card. It’s graphics card is not being bottle necked as much, as it has a better cpu than the base PS4

The ps4 has a worse processor, a far worse processor than the steamdeck. 

The gpu in the steamdeck is not being bottlenecked by the cpu. This is why the steamdeck outperforms the ps4 because it can’t utilise its 15 percent better performing gpu over the steam deck.

I NEVER said that the steamdeck is comparable to the ps4 pro at 1080p, but at the decks target resolutions.

I have been arguing the case that the steamdeck is outright better than the base ps4.

So get the ps4 pro out of your fucking head you moron.

this debate **IS OVER** if you have nothing to say about the BASE ps4 compared to steamdeck, then I have nothing to say to you. So stop mentioning it.

I'm saying that the deck is not ALWAYS more powerful, like you keep saying ""the steam deck is outright better than the ps4"" when it literally is not, the ps4 just has more gpu power, not even you can deny that.

Relative performance to ps4 PRO, the PRO. 

Tflops don’t matter as the steamdeck has a far better cpu, more modern architecture and with far more features compared to the base ps4.

Also it gets more fps at the same settings which I already said.",SteamDeck

Also another game that the deck performs better than the base ps4 on at 1080p

Dying light. The ps4 also uses lower texture quality than the deck at that game.

This does not always mean better performance, for the millionth time. I'm not responding again, you're too stupid to understand basic game and hardware logic",SteamDeck
jhxlh34,"I said:

“It’s comparable to the pro when factoring in the reduced resolution target”

Maybe you didn’t see it.

Then you made another comment that said the base ps4 is stronger than the deck, which I said it isn’t.

You’re the one too stupid here. It doesn’t matter if the gpu is better, if the cpu is holding it back enough that the steamdeck can overcome it by not bottlenecking it’s own gpu.

Extract Sacrosanct into the Mods folder, so the path should be Skyrim/Mods/Sacrosanct. 

For the bat transformation one, depends on if it needs SKSE or not. Sacrosanct doesn’t so the above is enough, but if that other mod needs SKSE, all I can say is people have gotten it working but I am not one of them.

> What does that mean for games? With a Z1 Extreme, if you’re playing at 720p with low settings like you might comfortably do on a seven-inch handheld, AMD claims you can cross the 60fps line for games as demanding as Red Dead Redemption 2 and more than double that for Forza Horizon 4 — all upscaled to 1080p with AMD’s Radeon Super Resolution.

Its simply too high res, and will only eat battery life for nothing. 120Hz screen is even more stupid, again eats battery and barely any game will run at consistent 120fps. Then it also uses Windows, which has shit ton of battery hogging background apps too.

Asus is not making much money of it if they compete with SD on the price, and if they charge same as other handheld makers there won't be much sales.

They do not have the chips or the battery to properly run at those specs on a handheld. But they put the more expensive screen in anyway even though it made absolutely no sense. 

By the way, those 'double performance' claims, that appears to be CPU scores at 35 W TDP. So you wouldn't see it in a real game, because those are mostly GPU bound. And if you actually ran at 35 W, even if you could cool it down fast enough with their double fans, your battery would die in about 20 minutes. Every tech expert is saying the 'double performance' is wildly misleading at best. The 50 % at 15 W is more realistic, but it's still just theoretical math, no one has properly benchmarked this with real games.

If they had free gamepass for life, I think they would have led with that, because that would be their biggest selling point. And if they can sell more, they can make them cheaper, so it wouldn't make much sense to hide your selling points.",SteamDeck

Zen 4 cores should be vastly superior to the Zen 2 cores in the Deck, even at the same power target.

So while some of the numbers out there might be at 30 watts TDP, even at the same 15 watts as the Steam Deck, the Z1 (Extreme) should handily outperform it, especially in CPU performance.

The screen of the Ally is also just objectively superior. Yeah, technically a higher resolution screen uses more power (everything else being equal), but it won't be a battery killer. We've had >= 1080p screens in smartphones for years. Running games in 1080p obviously requires more power than running them in 720p/800p, but the great thing is that you don't have to. You can run demanding titles at a lower resolution and then upscale using FSR or the game's internal upscaler, resulting in super sharp HUD/2D elements, with only the 3D scene being upscaled. 120 Hz is also great, even if you won't run many games at frame rates close to 120. It seems to have adaptive sync, which is very nice and it being 120 Hz gives it a big operating range.

Windows might have more stuff going on in the background, but it's not that big of a resource hog as some people make it out to be. People are using ultra-thin ""business notebooks"" all day on battery running Windows just fine. And it's not like Windows is actively trying its hardest to slow your game down. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see official SteamOS support for the Ally, but that's more because of the overall out-of-the-box experience, not because SteamOS is oh-so lightweight.

Not sure about pricing as we obviously don't know yet, I doubt it'll compare favorably to the Deck, but it's still a great piece of hardware and I have a hard time understanding why some people - many of them Steam Deck owners - outright refuse to accept that.",SteamDeck

jhqcr4l,"\~50% more speed at *2x the TDP* isn't nearly as impressive as the hype engine was implying. In a handheld expected to operate off a battery at any point, a 30w TDP is a pretty massive limitation.  

Remember, the Deck runs at 15w TDP and one of the biggest complaints about it is that its battery doesn't give you much playtime at that level. 50% more performance at twice the TDP for the normal chip is... Rough, given that these are handhelds we're talking about. 

I mean, it's neat and all, but when the Ally was first announced we were being told stuff like ""100-150% faster at 30w TDP, still \~50% faster at a 15w TDP like what the Deck uses."" 

Now we know that was for the high end and presumably super expensive extreme chip, not the one that's actually likely to be competitively priced with the Deck. That one isn't much better than the already existing high end handhelds which already struggle to compete with the Deck.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice improvement and I hope the next version of the Deck uses chips like these, but I see this as a splash of cold water on the Ally. I mean, the only thing the Ally had going for it was raw power/visual fidelity and windows for gamepass/anticheat compatibility.

Also, TDP at which Ally gains mentionworthy leads greatly exceeds reasonable 15W TDP.   


For reference I have GPD WinMax 2 aside from the Steam Deck and while I love it to bits, if it wasn't for included keyboard and trackpad, the Windows experience would be simply impossible. Also when I push 6800U at 28W it obliterates the battery :\]",SteamDeck

Not necessarily a performance upgrade, but the base Z1 should match the Van Gogh APU in the steam deck from a gratis perspective. On the CPU side Z1 will utterly smash the deck (2-2.5x uplift).

2.8 TFLOPS from 4 RDNA3 CUs would indicate a clockspeed of roughly 2.8 GHz, a full 75% higher than the deck's 1.6 GHz limit. It's also RDNA3 which has been providing a roughly 15-20% uplift based solely on uArch improvements. Basically you're looking at twice the performance per CU which puts the base Z1 right in line with the Deck.

Whether you consider the hardware side of things an upgrade is up to you. Personally the loss of the trackpads, steam OS, and the ergonomic changes place it at more of a side-grade in my mind. With that said, 120hz with VRR would be extremely nice to have and the vastly improved performance for high end emulation would be sweet.

They’re thought is more along the lines of why the FPS isn’t 4x as much.  If deck gets 40fps shouldn’t this new chip with 4x teraflop be hitting like 160 fps?  And my reasoning is no, no it shouldn’t.

The OG Switch and nearly every modern screen is 100%. I've put the exact same scene on deck and OG Switch and the deck's inability to reproduce color is very obvious. If they were a cheap chromebook, they'd be marked down in a review for the quality of the screen...and they're a handheld gaming device.

Battery is often trumpeted as vitally important for handhelds. I don't know about your usage, but my deck rarely went below 70%. Handheld is just not a form factor I'm going to play for multiple hours. The benefit of handheld is quick pop in and out. I would happily exchange a better product for a shorter battery life. When I'm traveling with my handhelds there's power everywhere and I already have a host of battery banks with me to keep the many, many other devices we all have charged.

I may be unique. Perhaps the average handheld user DOES use their device for hours at a time. I don't know. I bet ASUS knows though.

VRR is especially useful on devices that can't hold a specific framerate. It's common on the deck to lower refresh rate not because the deck can't hit higher FPS, but because it can't HOLD it. VRR solves for that by adjusting the refresh rate to match the FPS.",SteamDeck

Each version of Proton improves things (mostly, since it sounds like 8 actually broke a number of games) but things only need to improve because things weren't working perfectly in the first place.

So you can do all that....or on Windows you can just run the setup wizard. These were literally the first 5 games I tried and every one had an issue with the OS.

SteamOS is an adventure in checking ProtonDB for compatibility before you even buy the game, then searching that database for workarounds to the problem if one exists.

* utilizing Lossless Scaling for FSR
* SteamOS Fan curve
* Adjusting GPU and CPU Clocks
* Xbox and DS4 controller emulation support
* EqualizerAPO for better sound from the speakers

You cannot have a flawless experience whether it's SteamOS or Windows. There is always bugs. There are reasons to use either OS, there isn't a ""better"" or ""best"" there is a ""best for you"".

Valve's lack of Windows support forces the community to find tweaks and create apps to streamline the experience as best as possible, but it's still janky from a UI standpoint.

As far as ProtonDB ratings, once you account for native titles around 45 of the top 100 games should in theory work perfectly, but gold titles in my experience also usually work perfectly or, in the worst case, with very minor problems. This is especially the case for Steam Deck given that many titles are rated gold due to issues specific to certain hardware or OS installations, and the Steam Deck is a fixed configuration with Valve prioritizing fixes that affect it in particular.

ji3iwo6,"Update: I got the answer  


Answer: Yes you can Install Steam OS Via SD Card. You will want to flash a copy of the Steamdeck OS (Which can be downloaded directly from Steam's Website) by using Rufus.  


After Flashing the SD Card with the OS, plug the card into your Steamdeck. Then Hold down the volume up and press the power button. This will bring you to the boot menu.  


Select boot from file, then choose the SD Card.  


Once in the desktop of steam OS after booting from the SD Card, choose the ""Reimage"" option when installing to an empty drive.  


The rest is the same as the other guides out there. Just odd that their is not a single video showing that you can install from SD Cards... Especially if you have some already laying around like I did",SteamDeck

jhwi844,"If you haven't used Retroarch so far, why not try deinstalling that? Although before that, i would just try reinstalling your standalone Citra Emulator exactly the way you did it originally, in case Retroarch somehow messed up its files - so basically that you would get to overwrite any changes that Retroarch might have done. I'd say start there, reinstall standalaone Citra, see if your game works. If not, deinstall Retroarch for now, see if it works then. If you still want to keep Retroarch it is still useful to try and deinstall temporarily, just to narrow the problem down.

&#x200B;

Maybe more importantly though - did you check if the *savefile* works on your Retroid or just the *game rom*? Because yeah, I'd assume your rom doesn't get bricked somehow, but your savefile might somehow. So that's important i think.",SteamDeck

I did find out what it was, I had to delete the shaders.

I found out the save state location and save location after going through the settings a bit more, however I also found out save states were off by default. 

After some filepath searching I noticed both citra and retroarch had a same file, opengl, which I found out after searching was shaders. Deleted both files, ran up citra, game booted up.

I think by running it on retroarch and through citra2018 rather than citra it ended up breaking the shaders or something which caused the problem.",SteamDeck

I had it on the standalone citra emulator, I believe it’s still there too. But for RetroArch, I haven’t actually saved yet. Not even state wise (I’m actually having trouble finding a way to even use save states in retroarch, or open up a emulator menu for button mapping or exiting emulation.) 

I’m probs just dumb and am overlooking the right file path by overthinking or something. They also did a update recently so maybe a update might help in having those folders, or options for",SteamDeck
jhuo5aa,"I am pretty sure Emudeck has auto save states and auto load states on by default so it doesn't matter if you get to a save to made a state, retroarch will create the state for you when you exit the game. You can find that state and delete it to eliminate it as a possibility.",SteamDeck
jhxt8go,"No clue on the auto save state part being default. I guess I must've somehow disabled auto saves because I ended up finding the setting options for saves, (locations too), and it was already off. 

It ended up being a shader problem, after looking through the hidden files and folders I ended up finding a folder named opengl in both citra and retroarch, after deleting both I was able to boot up the game without issue. Had to delete several other files but I think those were logs, they didn't seem to be needed for the emulators, and they would keep popping up after deleting. (I KNOW some were logs due to being in a folder named logs, others were in some other folder that had more to do with non essential game data itself rather than save functionality, as they would pop back up after attempting to start the game.)



Tldr
Got it fixed, it was a broken shader problem.

Thanks for the help though! Wouldn't have found a few file paths if you hadn't suggested a few things.",SteamDeck

Pop off the membranes on the boards corresponding to each button, clean both the membrane and the board underneath rubbing gently with a qtip imbued in isopropyl alcohol.

jhonbdv,"First, I would prefer a grip style phone mount-arm over magsafe or anything magnetic. While magsafe with modern iphone may retain wireless charging capability, I've always had bad experience with magnetic adhesive for my Samsung phone to the point that I no longer use magnetic holder for my car's phone mount.

Second, your design seems to just have one straight arm with articulation at the base and mounting points. I've seen several gopro style arm mounts on this reddit and 3d print sites that have extra articulation elbows to accomodate different angles. I don't think I would buy a mount if there isn't at least 1 articulation elbow in the mid section.

Third, have you test if the design is able to reverse mount a phone below the SD? I think that's a use case many have not experiment with and can be a viable experience.

jhosnyo,"Hey Namasu!

1. Yeah I do understand wanting a mechanical grip, but making an arm like that adds a ton of weight to the design, which actually makes it feel to me like it tips it into unusable territory. I also experience your frustrations with magnets and magsafe adapters, and I've done a lot of research on them actually. I found there is one specific kind of adapter that works heads and shoulders better than the rest, and that's the one I'm going to include in the kit.
2. Pretty similar comment for the extra articulation point. It adds some weight, and my research shows that 90-95% of customers only need the one degree of freedom. This is what's so cool about using the gopro standard, since if you find yourself in the 5-10% of customers that need more articulation, it's really easy to expand the system to fit your needs exactly.
3. The current design can mount below the Deck! (it's a bullet point in the image shown in the original post) All you have to do is unclip it from your deckmate and reclip it in the other orientation. (this is actually the way I use it most comfortably)

In the end there's not going to be a perfect mount for every single person, so I'm trying to design the most versatile version so people can customize it to their own desires! I think this strikes a good balance between versatility, weight, and complexity. You can definitely take it and make it your own!",SteamDeck

* Open the iso from within the Dolphin file explorer and extract it's contents to a folder
* Install Lutris (you can get this from discover)
* Within Lutris:
   * Click the + button on the top left for ""add game""
   * Select ""install a windows game from media""
   * Give it a name (I just did Riddick)
   * Install
   * Change installation location if needed
   * When prompted for the setup file, browse to the folder you extracted the iso into and select ""setup.exe""
   * Let it run, which will start the games installer
   * Perform the install
   * When it is finished, close the installer and do not start the game yet
* In Dolphin
   * Move the exe for the patch into the same directory as Riddick.exe - you can find this path from Lutris if needed
* Back in Lutris
   * Highlight the game and go to the bottom bar where there is a wine menu you can expand
   * Click ""run EXE inside wine prefix""
   * Select the patch and let it run
      * If it fails, you may have a different region iso/patch or have cracks installed that prevent it applying properly
   * After the patch succeeds, right click the game and click ""configure""
   * Go to ""game options""
   * Change the executable from whatever/folders/Riddick.exe to whatever/folders/System/Win64_AMD64/SbzEngine.exe
   * Run the game
* In game
   * Go to settings and change the resolution to 1280 x 800
      * The default resolution is very weird and cuts off the sides of the screen
   * Enable gamepad
   * Re-configure the controls, the default gamepad has left and right sticks swapped from most games

Wayland is considered the future and where all future work is.  In theory, it's an architectural rewrite that should lead to significantly better performance and maintainability.  In practice, it's sadly missing handling of certain use cases that the developers/architects have either completely ignored or dismissed as unimportant.  Anyone doing photo/video editing work needs to stick with X due to missing color management features.

At that point if you display an image that has a gradual change from a yellow with a vibrancy of 8 to a 9 and finally to 10, now it will all look like 10. It's basically crushing detail.

Actually you don't need to imagine anything. Look at, say, [this picture](https://images6.alphacoders.com/130/1302421.jpg) while playing around with the vibrancy. You will see finer details like the pendant on Dracula's chest in the background quickly disappear.",SteamDeck

The second problem I have, is it's pretty hard to see the corners of the screen. This isn't always a problem, but it can be an issue if you end up playing something that throws tiny text in a corner.

The deck is probably one of the easiest things to run emulators in to be honest since it relies on a fantastic UI. 

I recommend the 64GB with an SD card if emulating is your primary goal. If you’re doing classic, ps1 and earlier, a smaller SD card will do just fine. If you want to do PS2, GameCube, ect, you’ll need a larger as card as the games can easily go over a GB. 

As for where to get Roms.. a Google search is your best friend. Don’t believe we’re allowed to link where to get them. But I can tell you, you do NOT need to buy an SD card preloaded. I highly recommend against it actually. 

TLDR; It’s super easy to set up the SteamDeck to be an emulator and will run most PS2 and GameCube games with ease and very little if any set up. My brother in law, who has never done emulation, was able to set up up with no questions. Super intuitive.",SteamDeck

You have an Anbernic.  Uses Emuation Station - so does EmuDeck.  In fact, the Anbernic came with all the bios files you need and the roms will copy almost everything right over.

Retrodeck is made by the same devs behind AmberElec and 351elec so it's going to have the same central mindset.

Anyway, It seems fine after putting it back together. I'll give it several hours of heavy use to give it another thought. I'll be opening it again when guli kit releases new Rev thumb sticks and also thought crap I should have checked for fan dust. So maybe when I hit my year mark I'll do that just because. Probably swap out the backplate at some point too and ultimately I'm hopeful that valve will just do main board upgrades.

jhvlv7b,"I'm sure it was a better idea to open it and remove debris than just leave it in to cause more damage. Not to mention it would drive me crazy. I wouldn't worry too much about the missing clip if it still feels sturdy. Not sure how much it reduces the integrity by opening, and the integrity is already compromised by the broken clip. I doubt it affects it too much, mine still feels fine. You probably don't want to open it super often or you'll probably weaken the clips more, but opening it a couple times to do repairs or improvements shouldn't be a huge problem as long as you're careful.",SteamDeck
jhvwmvu,"I really don’t think they meant to, it was just a fuzzy quote which they backed up with links. The sentiment is still correct, Valve officially doesn’t want you to open up the deck, but also they realize people will anyway, so they’ve made parts available.",SteamDeck

jhthqwt,"There are several options for an NVME upgrade, so I ask that you please don't overpay for an SSD.    

You can get the [Micron 2TB Drive](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR99P.shtml&order_id=323669245&sitem=B09WR99#Availability)  straight from a US distributor for $158. The same price as the [1TB Inland TN446](https://www.microcenter.com/product/663766/inland-tn446-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck). 
The closest *available* option to this is the 2TB SN740 from AliExpress for $160+ but it's a risk and you won't have a warranty if you're within the US. The Micron 2TB has also been listed on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/micron-2tb-2400-series/p/0D9-0022-000N1?Item=0D9-0022-000N1) for $160 but is out of stock and they have cancelled many orders from those that were able to place them when it came in stock earlier this week...

Alternatively, if that's out of your price range you can buy the [1TB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01112_B09WR98P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!#Availability) for $89.  Comparatively, the [1TB Sabrent Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) sells for $160 on Amazon. And if you're fortunate enough to live near a Microcenter, they also sell their [1TB Inland TN346](https://www.microcenter.com/product/649991/inland-tn436-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck) for around $130, now on sale for $109 to match the brand new [1TB Corsair MP600](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Storage/M-2-SSDs/MP600-MINI-PCIe-4-0-%28Gen-4%29-x4-NVMe-M-2-2230-SSD/p/CSSD-F1000GBMP600MN) that is also selling for $109.


A lot of people find the convenience of going to Microcenter to purchase and exchange/swap the SSD *if* it ever fails much more valuable than the extra storage space and that's fine, but I would personally rather have double the storage and a new backplate for the same price or less than either of the 1TB Inland Drives.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, and someone recently posted that they're entering their 4th week of waiting for a 1TB Micron from ShopBLT, but they don't mind waiting for such a deep discount.   

The Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740, Corsair MP600 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300. 

Here's [the specs and review](https://www.techpowerup.com/ssd-specs/micron-2400-2-tb.d810)  for it as well.


Regarding Micro SDs, there are 2 main cards that this subreddit will recommend.    

[Samsung 512GB Evo Select ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1HMJ9Z) as this doesn't have a 1TB option    
Or    
[SanDisk 512GB Extreme](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X7C2GBC/) this DOES have a 1TB option, so buy what's in your budget.

I will never want to play a triple A modern game on a tiny 7 inch screen instead of on a proper setup with max settings and a beautiful 1440p monitor. 

There’s a very small percentage of people who are willing to pay $700 to play those games in handheld form when current gen consoles are half that price.",SteamDeck
jhyiajh,more steam sales for valve either way.,SteamDeck

Prodeus is more quakey/doom run and gun, fast action may be slightly difficult for touch controls if you’re not the best, but I bet easy would be fine

Cultic has a nice story, more fun Easter eggs like duke nukem, more relaxed play if you prefer sneaking around. Can make as hard or easy as you want I think.

jhsoyk0,"Ah... I'm so sorry. There's a small chance this is just a software bug, which can be fixed by first hitting the reset GPU driver button combo and then a factory reset. This is specially more common if you've used alternative Proton versions before. 

But in all likelihood, you have the dreaded GPU crash bug. Don't bother listening to the explanation given in the main thread about the issue (it's outdated and misleading) but unfortunately it's a hardware fault and only a RMA can fix it. This issue seems to keep disappearing and reappearing in batches of Steam Decks, I wonder exactly why they can't pinpoint the root cause during manufacturing.",SteamDeck
jhsqwvu,the issue in general seems to be one that snuck into stable from the 3.5 alpha. certain updates of the 3.5 alpha have had this issue while others worked perfectly fine. decky also seems to cause it.,SteamDeck

1. Press the power button multiple times.

2. Charge on the dock but no powee Led light.

I personally don't think there's anything difficult about checking if the battery is connected (access to battery is relatively easy) but if you don't feel confident to do it you'll have to go through Steam support again. Hopefully everything gets fixed for you this time.

In case you find confidence to check tho, you can follow this guide up to step 8 where they disconnect the battery cable so you just check if it's connected properly at that point: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Battery+Replacement/149070
