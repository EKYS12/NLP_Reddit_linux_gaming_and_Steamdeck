I was having trouble getting an N64 emulator (rosalies mupen64) to work with the buttons, bumpers or joysticks. It only recognized keyboard inputs.

I wish companies weren't so lazy about supporting/updating ""old"" projects in favor of the new stuff. If done well, this kind of work directly energizes the fanbase and makes us more than happy to throw money at anything else you're working on afterward.

Please, for the love of God, do more of this. Dev teams, take some time between projects to look at how you can modernize/improve your old work. Publishers, give the devs that time they need. It's worth it, I swear.",SteamDeck

How often do decks go and push some kinda update to enhance a jank ass old ps3 or wii-u game? Probably never. In their defense I don't actually know but I don't see why they would considering those consoles are past their market life time.

It really cannot be overstated: as long as the game *runs well*, you can come up with a control scheme that uses only mouse and keyboard movements to play *any game*.

ji3ldxp,"well, that depends on the game/ user's experience, but I find rimworld/ CK3/ Stellaris perfectly playable on the steam deck using the track pads, and it's great to be able to play them on the go/ on my daily commute. I would PREFER a mouse and keyboard for sure but I don't really see how you could get controller support (like, an xbox controller) to work with that.

Turning the left trackpad into radial menu/ hotkey helps a ton because you can instantly access all the most important tabs immediately instead of hovering around with your mouse. Honestly, this kinda works BETTER than a whole ass keyboard because you can name all of the hotkeys even with cute little PNGs.... whereas i don't think anyone can remember ALL the hotkeys on the keyboard all the time.",SteamDeck
ji2qnfw,"You can easily fix that via Steam Input by using the ""Repeat"" function. So holding the joystick to one direction will translate into constantly tapping in that direction, with a specified time of your choice.

When a developer chooses to ignore accessibility features for gamers with disabilities, or for games where using a controller isn't really viable, I pass on it.

I have that remake installed on my desktop which runs fine under lutris/wine. Most old games work fine under wine, hell many work better under wine than they do on Windows.

Matter of fact, gamemode makes old games on desktop much better. I tried to play age of empires 2 on my 4k display and it was impossible to see shit at native Res.

The FedEx store was connected to this big business building its fkin huge so we went there and talked to the lobby security hoping maybe it got dumped there but no, we gave them our information and went home talked to steam again and told them we might ask for a refund if we don't find it tomorrow at the building.

Probably a few hrs b4 we went to look again, I got a call from a woman who works at the building telling me they found our package, she said it was at the 6th floor and NO ONE goes there but this one electrician and he happened to find it and brought it to lobby.

I ofc thanked her profusely and we picked it up...I have 0 idea how fkin FedEx decided to put a package meant to be sent to their store get put on the 6th floor instead of like the lobby if they were fkin lost.

I could be wrong, but I personally would contact them to see if this falls under their jurisdiction. I would start with the shipping carrier and if they give no information or help I'd go to the FTC. Here's a brief summary from their site that I feel like relates to this theft:

&#x200B;

""The basic statute enforced by the FTC, Section 5(a) of the [FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act),  **empowers the agency to investigate and prevent unfair methods of  competition, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting  commerce**. This creates the Agency’s two primary missions: protecting  competition and protecting consumers. **The statute gives the FTC  authority to seek relief for consumers, including injunctions and  restitution, and in some instances to seek civil penalties from  wrongdoers.** The FTC has the ability to implement trade regulation rules  defining with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive  and the Commission can publish reports and make legislative  recommendations to Congress about issues affecting the economy. The  Commission enforces various antitrust laws under Section 5(a) of the FTC  Act as well as the [Clayton Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/clayton-act). The FTC [monitors all its orders](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/media-resources/enforcing-orders.pdf) to ensure compliance.""

Either way, reporting this, to me, is a good idea (barring discrimination or something). It establishes a history of theft in your area, which they could then circle back to if they catch this person doing something else. They can also use the report to prioritize their future efforts. And you can use the police report if for some reason insurance or something becomes involved.",SteamDeck

ji2yy0d,">The juice wouldnt be worth the squeeze. ""Simple"" to spoof in software, on the steam deck, would require reverse engineering and modifying, aka cracking, the part of SteamOS that reads the serial, or the part that reports the serial to Steam. OK, thats possible, maybe even along the easier side. Then you have to apply that modification to the read only OS. Sure, that can be disabled with a few simple commands easily found in guides.  
>  
>Now things get less simple, since you have to do this again anytime SteamOS updates itself, or when the deck is reimaged which is about step 3 if it ever meets a tech, like for a warranty claim or repair.  Even without reimaging, a simple file check will make it obvious where and how the system has been modded.

>Get past all that and sure, you could make your deck report a spoofed serial# to Steam, who have all deck serials on record and the accounts that purchased them. So any such deception would be glaringly obvious. How they choose to respond to that is their call, and would depend on whether the reported serial matched the account logging in with it, was reported stolen, or did not match any sold deck. So exactly what does this gain you?

>What consumers would want does not change how the tech works. As for Valve having ""this capability"", if you are talking about disabling a deck like TheAsko mentioned, I never implied they could, would, or should.

The Deck's bootloader/BIOS has no similar restrictions.  It'll boot anything, as evidenced by how many people use Clonezilla as part of SSD upgrades.

The only thing Valve can do is blacklist the serial number from Steam itself, which does severely limit the usefulness/value of the device for 99%+ of people.  Or they may do something sneakier like letting you log in, and providing the cops with your IP address so they can get a warrant from your ISP.

Also for phones, you can blacklist the IMEI which results in:

1)  The towers rejecting the device

2)  The towers reporing that the device is within range

3)  E-911 is usually handled by the radio firmware, and so the device is probably getting a GPS lock and providing that to the carrier AND the cops.",SteamDeck

For mass-produced devices where the entire design and assembly process is done under the oversight of a single company (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, Sony), it's a small cost for security, so they do it. Apple has their consumer-unfriendly reasons for it, while Sony and Microsoft do it to make hacking and piracy more difficult.

Also, here’s a video confirming the performance I’m experiencing. I think it’s a very cpu bound game. My cpu runs significantly faster than this video as I’m on a 13600k at 5.7ghz, which is probably why I don’t have the same amount of frame drops into the high 50s. I’d still consider 68 fps average with occasional 56-58 fps drops very playable.

I am not sure, I have so many games installed that probably nobody has heard of thanks to [itch.io](https://itch.io) charity bundles and steam sales or epic and gog free games, amazon prime giveaways etc, lol..  I never thought that it would be possible to have more legitimate games than I can ever dream of playing :).

One rogueish game that plays great on deck and is maybe a bit obscure but fun is [Delver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/249630/Delver/), It can be a bit mean sometimes but that is part of the fun in rogue games ?.. For a more traditional rogue-like/lite game [Dungeons of Dredmor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/98800/Dungeons_of_Dredmor/) is a lot of fun, and one of the games where you will actually get close to the maximum battery life of \~7hours on the steam deck, lol.

The most recent game that I bought in steam sales was [The Bard's Tale Trilogy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/843260/The_Bards_Tale_Trilogy/) :).. bought specifically for deck and I am enjoying it, probably not for everyone but I love old school dungeon crawlers since they were new school when I was a kid hehe.  Maybe some newer versions of that style that I play on deck and few people have heard of would be things like [Fight Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/792120/FIGHT_KNIGHT/) and [StarCrawlers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/318970/StarCrawlers/)

[Styx: Master of Shadows](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242640/Styx_Master_of_Shadows/) is a fun and maybe obscure 3d stealth platformer that plays well on the deck, and I also own [Styx: Shards of Darkness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/355790/Styx_Shards_of_Darkness/) in preperation for if / when I finally complete the first one hehe.

Pretty much all of these games can be nabbed cheaply during steam sales I guess, I think that almost every game that I own on steam is purely because I have a giant wishlist that notifys me every time anything that I am interested in getting is on sale hehe, constant emails from steam every day or 2 letting me know :)",SteamDeck

ji2ao22,"Slay the Spire is a classic. If you're looking for another rogue deckbuilder, you should check out Across the Obelisk. It's similar to Slay the Spire but adds a few different twists and features. It also has multiplayer/co-op.

Great music too, and the game provides those tactical battle moments where you suddenly realize the perfect strategy and it all clicks into place and you walk away without taking a scratch. Those feel very good. It's in league with Into The Breach and FTL and Darkest Dungeon in that regard. Where those games are A+ this one is an A... Mostly due to the learning curve.",SteamDeck

ji360h2,Brilliantly put....,SteamDeck
ji2r0ie,"I play it almost exclusively in handheld mode. I docked it maybe two times just because my battery was low, which btw this game drains the battery fast at medium settings. I might test it on low and see if it does significantly better.

As for it not being verified, I wouldn't follow Steam's verified system. Instead check out ProtonDB. It has a much more accurate look on what games work on the SD or Linux in general. With that said, it has a rating of GOLD which means it runs well but with some minor issues. 

As I said before, battery life is an issue. Beyond that I did have it freeze on me once out of 10hrs or so of play. Might of been because I had it suspended a few times before rebooting the game. Also some text is off screen on some menus but it's usually just like the first letter of a word. 

In terms of not using MKB, the track pad works just fine. It's turn based so you don't have to be quick to use the track pad. I picked one of the higher rated Steam Deck controller settings for the game and just took off with it.

The game itself runs rlly well in handheld mode. 30FPS+ for the most part and the gameplay is rlly good. Highly recommend it!",SteamDeck

ji3kw7p,"Well seeing as it's not actually SLI anymore but NVLink, you're technically incorrect. But that's a technicality and I'll let it slide.

Most modern games are built on a game engine that utilizes Vulkan or DX12. Both of which have multi-gpu support built into them at better levels than ever before. It's up to the developers on if they are going to implement the multi-gpu support into their game or not. On games that doesn't support it, the 2nd gpu does nothing but idle. If it does, then it utilizes both of them. And the great thing about NVLink opposed to SLI is that SLI wasn't fast enough to pool VRAM so it was just mirrored (so if you had 2 GPU's that each had 8GB of VRAM, you still only had 8GB total). NVLink is fast enough that the VRAM is now pooled. So my dual 3090 setup means on titles that support multi-GPU I have 48GB of VRAM.

&#x200B;

But I'll state this as well. I got on EVGA's waitlist for the FTW3 version, and after 2 months I decided to just buy one I could find. Ended up paying $400 over MSRP for it. When I wasn't using my PC it was mining ETH. I ended up getting enough ETH that when my turn finally came around for EVGA's waitlist I was able to pay for it entirely with the ETH profit I made. I then used both cards to mine when I wasn't using the PC and was able to recoup my cost of the original 3090 plus pay for all the watercooling components (I've got a full custom watercooling setup for both 3090's with active backplates, and cpu waterblock on a triple + quad radiator setup.",SteamDeck

ji3ecv6,"Yup. You can use the little triangle to switch between whichever one you wanna use. Should look like this on the Deck:

ji3fkr1,The game needs to be installed on your PC since it will be streaming from your PC.,SteamDeck
ji3i471,"It's a lot more complicated than SRP where you just log in to steam, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too complex. Lemme provide a quick tutorial since I'm writing a book on the Deck and have my research material open:

Basically, first you download and install Sunshine on your host machine. [https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine)

Then you configure it in your web browser ([https://localhost:47990/](https://localhost:47990/), you can replace localhost with your specific IP if you're connecting away from home, but let's assume you're doing the configuration on your host machine).

Your browser might whine about an insecure connection, you can ignore this because it's just warbling at how it doesn't recognize the security certificate, the actual file is running on your own machine.

It'll ask you to set a username and password.

Then you change any settings you want, add any program exes you want (Sunshine should automatically add the remote desktop function itself, and honestly I find this the best way to use streaming with this program anyway lol), save your settings, and apply them to restart Sunshine.

At that point you move over to your Deck, crack open desktop mode and the discover store, and download Moonlight. Run Moonlight and ideally you'll see your host machine appear in the list.

If you don't, you can add it manually by plugging the host machine's specific IP into moonlight, found on your wifi properties in windows.

Then when you go to connect to the other computer, moonlight will give you a four number PIN that you plug into the PIN section of sunshine's configuration page. Moonlight will tell you to put that into geforce experience - you can ignore this, it's a relic of when GFE wasn't deprecated by nvidia, just plug the PIN into sunshine.

At which point you go back to moonlight and run remote desktop. Shazam, you should be done. Well, once you add moonlight as a non-steam game so you can play in gaming mode, anyway.

Only downside: Steaminput sees moonlight as its own program for purposes of controller mapping, it doesn't ""see"" that you're streaming, say, Doom Eternal or whatever, and won't use Doom Eternal's controller configs.

There's also a decky plugin for better moonlight integration with the Deck that should fix this steaminput annoyance, but I haven't been able to get it to work right yet.",SteamDeck
ji3m2q2,"Yes, but if its also already installed on the deck can I still do the stream from PC to lighten the load off my deck?

Edit: figured it out. Thanks",SteamDeck
ji3qu2a,"Thank you, I was able to download moonlight and enable remote play in GeForce experience and my pc popped up as an option on moonlight on the deck, it already had minecraft in there and when I select minecraft it just brings me to the desktop, im able to launch it and then I have to press ""start select l1 and r1"" together to use game pad mode, it's working now I'm thinking downloading sunshine might alleviate some of that, but thank you very much for your help this is huge lol",SteamDeck

Another thing is you came out swinging claiming it's ""legit"", when you haven't even done proper testing.

Install is a bit weird, you have to use desktop mode, add non steam game from desktop mode. But actually doing the install you want to do from gaming mode. Then back to desktop mode to add the bnet launcher as a non steam game.  
Delete the installer. Everything else including installing wow you can do in steam mode.

Was turned off by how quickly I was tasked with killing rats, and the battle system felt a little off to me, like they wanted to make a real time action battle system but felt like they needed to pay homage to the turn based system.

The extra interactions with the game world from the dart board in the bar, to the redesigned motorcycle section, to the cross dressing Cloud dancing section which had me grinning throughout.

The rest I found to be insufferably padded out. I did not care for the ghost things, as I felt as though they were a long-winded, pretentious way for the game to say ""things are going to play out differently than in the original and you need to be more open minded!"" It felt like they were spending too much energy defending their new story from potential purists/snobs/detractors instead of just letting their new story be, take it or leave it.

I went into the game with an open mind, and desperately tried to like it, so the stuff with the whispers didn't land well with me and only slowed the game down.

Is that supposed to be something positive???? Cause why the heck should it work docked on your TV, your TV should already have the correct color settings for all your gaming, it doesn't need to show what your slider changed, that's for the washed out Steam Deck screen only.
And if the TV shows it, it would look completely different to what you see on the Steam Deck screen cause like I said, the TV already has the correct vibrancy setting.

So this is pretty pointless.",SteamDeck
jhzftr2,"This is so good.

I love Vibrantdeck so much that I always think that should be something that the Steam Deck have by default, so the 100% of the people could enjoy it.

What is better, is colour calibration. Unfortunately Valve did not include KDE's colour management panel, BUT, you actually can select a specific combination of settings in ""night mode"" which is used in game mode and that is a way to colour-calibrate the screen and you will get richer colours as well.

I actually mix the Vibrance with HDR shaders from ReShade in a lot of games, and some LUT shaders too to make things just right for me.

You also have to realize that on a screen the size of the steam deck, details are harder to notice/appreciate anyways. So the loss of some of that, for the benefit of richer colours is preferred by many.",SteamDeck

jhzh9nu,The greatest thing is that Valve unlike other companies sticks with one product and really refines it before launching a new one unlike other companies. And that kind of determination and support is what really makes it special. I'm always about every new update that releases. Like I can't wait for the up to 60% smaller shader caches that will be implemented soon and hope that the new pipeline changes in Vulkan that enables asynchronous shader compilation (aka making them before you need them and you have some performance left for it). That might reduce them even more or even start to make them almost obsolete.. In a perfect world at least.

Creating a whole new feature might introduce tons of new bugs and problems. They are refining what is there before adding new things or building better features on top of already existing ones first. Valve is also very aware about and cautious when it comes to feature creep. I doubt this will be implemented before they even fix the problem of not being able to change the language of desktop mode.

But I'd certainly like to have the ability to share clips with friends.
But that would probably also need integrated sharing features to external platforms on the Deck itself or the addition of an FTP server that you can access via the Steam App on mobile to do so.

Saturation affects color intensity and enhances every color in an image. Vibrance is a little more specific. It saturates the parts of the image that aren't that colorful. This allows every color to stand out without making the composition look too busy..

Actually, even in the desktop pc market this happens, Nvidia has been doing it for so long that it isnt even funny

On what comes to consoles, yeah, its not normal to see a console last less than a year before the next one comes out, the only examples of consoles abandoned this fast are both from nintendo(virtual boy and wiiu)

but that isnt the only market the deck fits, also, while sony and microsoft are pretty good with support and updates, nintendo for example, just doesnt give a shit, 7 years, 3 different variations of their console in 500 colors each... And they still dont have themes, cloud saves are a mess, no dedicated server for any game at all and they took half the life of the console to add basic folders... Most of those being features their previous console had... 

So yeah, the deck support is amazing and valve should be recognized for it, just as sony should be recognized for the ps5 support, constant updates with improvements to graphics, performance and features, just amazing

Wtf, when I said something that could make you think that? I was just asking about your opinion about Vibrantdeck in case you tired it, just to know what you think. 

For what I read in this sub practically everyone that used Vibrantdeck prefer it above the default screen colours, some people line to set the value to 125, other prefer 140 and other prefer 170, but practically everyone agree that with Vibrantdeck the steam deck screen looks better. For that reason I said that it would be really cool if Valve increase the saturation of the steam deck by default, and later the user that want could reduce it if they preferred it the other way.

The complaint came out when the Controller was first introduced and Valve continued making it for **4 years** after that.

Both the Steam Controller **and** Steam Link were created to push Steam Machines, and all 3 were discontinued because of horrible sales of Steam Machines.

Yes, all 3 also helped them plan their next steps (eventually leading to the Deck), but the people saying ""this was the plan all along"" have no evidence to back that theory. Valve's plan was to get people using Steam as much as possible, which meant making easier entries into the ecosystem.

They have absolutely succeeded seeing that there’s so much attention being paid to competitors like Ally, G Cloud and Edge, as well as prompting action from the console manufacturers. 

Valve is (and may never be) well equipped enough to compete like-for-like with hardware OEMs and console manufacturers, but their hardware reflects what they believe to be new horizons for gaming. 

Between living room PCs, remote play, unorthodox controllers and VR, this is the first time we are actually reaching that horizon, yet people are actively going against that just because they like the Steam Deck. There’s just no need for that type of response. It’s fine to prefer the device itself over others, but anyone who likes SD conceptually should be welcoming competition because that’s the entire point of SD’s existence. To inspire a new market. 

(And hey, if you’re still insistent on talking down the Ally, just know that Zen 4 on both desktop and mobile has had poor idle power consumption, despite being very efficient under load. That’s my one concern for the Ally.)",SteamDeck

The incumbent OEMs will start jumping in and I wouldn't be surprised if we had something like 4-5 competing products soon. I also predict that both Microsoft and Sony will get in the handheld space with Xbox and Playstation offerings in the next 2-3 years. Both companies have massive exclusive back catalogs they could be reaping profits on by selling to handheld gamers.

I think Valve's long-term play is to make SteamOS the Windows/Android of handheld gaming devices. Let the OEMs deal with manufacturing nonsense and collect your sweet $$$ as Steam commissions.",SteamDeck

jhyntg5,"The top thing with the rog ally, is now that we have a big name player in the market, other big names will want a piece, and amd themselves started on apus tailored towards making that an easier reality rather than needing to specifically partner with a manufacturer each time. This also means a new generation steam deck with a higher end processor will happen more likely as production on these new chips at scale will make the cost of them more reasonable for valve to do so, as well as continue to rely on steam as the core money maker, keeping the consumer cost for a more powerful steamdeck lower than other devices again.

If Asus had licensed the steam decks controller configuration, it would be a no question better handheld, simply because of the better screen and the egpu connectivity. As it is now, there are trade offs on each side. More power, but limited to traditional controller controls only. Steam deck is less powerful, but has a more flexible control scheme.

Competition is good. I look forward to seeing what HP does under their gaming label Omen, or what Dell Alienware releases, Lenovo Legion? Each company has a unique design language, and it will lead to different handhelds. I can see Dell Alienware actually bringing the handheld concept they had shown off in the past to market with its switch like controllers.",SteamDeck

Before the steam deck, the Nintendo switch was my favorite system of all time. I want to own my games. I want to be entertained by them when I want, not at a certain permissible time. The nintendo switch provided that for me. I only played my ps4 pro for vr games. 

But I absolutely love the Steam Deck because of the controls. I'm heavily into RTS's. With the steam deck and its track pads, that's no problem. 

I can play typing of the dead with my steam deck. 

The precision of aiming with the gyro and trackpad while setting myself up for a quick switch from a sniper back to close quarters armament with a touch of a button. 

I can play games and set them up in ways that I could only do with a mouse and keyboard before, and then I would have to switch to a controller to play my fighting games. The Steam Deck gives me a ton of accessibility. It makes my experience seemless. From what I've seen about the Ally, it can not. 

For what I want out of a portable system, that makes the ally inferior to me. It halves my games and increases my load if I want to take the Ally other places.  Deal breaker for me.

The touchpads just add so much functionality for me; I've been able to put hundreds of hours into keyboard and mouse driven strategy games, as well as set them to use a radial menu in many other games that also have heaps of controls and hot keys.

You are right, having competition is good. And so what if a better device comes out. It doesnt suddenly invalidate your current device or make it worse in any way.

Edit: And I just saw that the highest end model will apparently be $699 US, so just a bit more than the highest end steam deck.

Also the website says multiple skus in the foot note but only one set of specs, to me based one the Z1 & Z1 extreme that amd showed off,  it'll be like this Z1 will be minor improvement over SD for an equal price (not really worth it for most) and if there is an extreme variant it'll be outside of a reasonable price range for most (this is the aya & GPD cut).

I don't care really care about the power of the SD, there are other factors that are far more important to me that I don't see the ROG having, namely the Steam Input configuration. Having the two touch pads, the back paddles, being able to map action layers, toggle between them, create radial menus, button toggles, rapid-fire, macros for key combos or specify clicks to specific areas of a screen... The tools that Steam gives you to customize your controls to translate any PC game to a controller is the main reason I love it. Hell, I would actually go for a weaker SD that's a little lighter, but keeps the steam input configuration tools. Oh - and the fact that you can share the templates you've made, and there are many years worth of templates already available to jump off most games with.

I don't care how strong the ROG is... PC games aren't really built for handhelds, and need something like the steam input. The steam deck would not have taken off without the many years they put into the steam input tool prior.

Everyone is fine with Windows, until it shits the bed. So everyone “reviewing it” is just gonna download the AAA games, go “oooo, ahhhhh, StEm DeCK KiLlEr” for clickbait and send it back to X manufacturer. 

Meanwhile, battery life is dog shit cuz windows backgrounds suck up power, the AAA games get more demanding so people get more disappointed, you might download something funny and brick the OS. 

That’s why Valve **never** advertised it like crazy. It’s a purely niche thing that’s in the works and if you stray beyond what they advertise with no wherewithal you’re going to be disappointed.",SteamDeck

jhx6ctd,"Battery life man... Unless Asus devs really got some bleeding edge tech game on their sleeves, they cant make a better battery life to performance ratio with a reasonable weight for a handheld. If they can deliver atleast the same 3hrs with SD or even 2hrs with all that ""double the performance"" bells and whistles going on, I'm gonna sell my SD and buy their product.",SteamDeck

jhxlhvb,"First of all it has no trackpads. That's a huge downside. Second it does use windows 11 another big downside. But I admit that's second one is just me.

But I doubt that it will match the controller convinence steam has. The SD is smoothly controlled and I can even play mouse heavy games with ease. I don't see how that will go down without trackpads.

I am not really interested in asus take, mostly because I would have to endure windows again. But if they are successful good for them, I think the market is big enough for more players. And competition is good for the consumer. But I think they still have to proof that they are better, pure stats is really only important for a small minority.",SteamDeck

If I wanted news about it I’d be in a generalized handheld or gaming sub, not one that with rules that all posts must relate to the deck.",SteamDeck
jhwh0pe,"Competition is a good thing. No doubt. I suspect there are some caveats to the Ally though. Namely price; nobody can subsidise the hardware with software sales on PC except Valve. So you're gonna pay for the top end hardware in the Ally. 

Second, the TDP/battery balance means realistically whilst you'll get a 1080p output on the ally, performance won't really be much, if any better, unless you're happy to live with a sub one hour battery.

I think the smart play here is to enjoy your steam deck, and wait for another generation of the Z1 to come along. The upcoming chips are super impressive, but only when they're pulling 30w. Which just isn't practical for a handheld.",SteamDeck

Also my SD is still wonderful, a new device doesn’t change that.",SteamDeck
jhx3her,"I don't understand why Steam Deck fans are making such a big deal about price. Yes I get it , Steam Deck offers an excellent value for the money but it's a cheaper product with lower performance. Not everyone is looking for that and competitors need to make products too to push this space forward, otherwise we'd be stuck at the same performance level (which Valve already mentioned they might do for Steam Deck 2 and that would be bad). When the Steam Deck launched with RDNA 2 graphics, no handheld PC AT ANY PRICE could compete with the Steam Deck in game performance in all popular games. That's $1000+ handhelds that much lower game performance but it's different now, and there's going to be lots of adults like myself that don't mind spending the money for a more powerful competing product. There's also an issue of compatibility, no amount of value for a handheld will make someone buy a it if it can't play the game they buy it for.

I use my Aya Neo 2 like a laptop while docked. It can play most games much more comfortably than the Steam Deck and I use it like a PC because the non gaming performance is extremely good (not just for a handheld, against laptops too) and I don't have to worry about compatibility either.",SteamDeck
jhx5g9s,Biggest issues I have right off the bat with the Rog Ally is no trackpads and the asymmetrically placed joysticks. Add onto that no SteamOS and you’ve got yourself no dealio. I also find it hard to believe ASUS can compete price-wise since they have no marketplace of their own and therefore can’t sell the consoles at a loss like Valve can.,SteamDeck
jhx63ht,"Personally I don't really care if SD or Ally is better. Deck came first and it covers everything I need and more so as far as I'm concerned, I'm covered gaming-wise for the next 3 to 4 years.

I have an SD, I don't need anything else for a very long time. I have 350 games in my backlog and the vast majority of them will probably work with the SD. I'm here to occasionally see something cool people are doing with their SD, or peep a game that works really well for it, or get tips about using it, or just keeping up with new releases and beta channel stuff.  


The SD is not my primary gaming machine, it's basically my road-trip/traveling console. That means a couple times a year I'll load something on it to kill hours in transit. Massive backlog, lightly used handheld console, probably a good 10 years before I need to think about replacing it (provided it doesn't fail first). My experience is not an uncommon one.",SteamDeck

The ally, looking at the price of the rog phones will have a significant price hike compared to the deck and be targeted at a high end user market. It won’t be competition for the deck as it will have a different target audience similar to the ayaneo which again I don’t look at as competition as the target market is completely different. It basically all comes down to price but unless it’s below £699 I wouldn’t see it swaying people already looking at a deck unless they’re minted",SteamDeck

jhwuwct,"There was one thread about it the other day that nearly made me think this was more of a cult than a group of people who enjoy the same thing coming together. So many comments just absolutely shunning those who think the Ally might be worth looking at. Just because Valve are being the ‘good guy’ right now doesn’t mean they should be a monopoly. So many companies become complacent when they’re top dog for too long. Just look at Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA. Even the next SD generation isn’t supposed to have a performance uplift according to rumours, just a better screen and battery. We keep treating this like a console when it just isn’t, it’s a PC handled portably. If there’s competition like the Ally, it may force Valve to actually give us more performance alongside the better screen and battery. Marginal upgrades are toxic, especially when they’re targeted at the already existing user base. I won’t stand for when Apple does it, I won’t stand for when Intel does it, and I won’t stand when Valve does it. If Valve’s release target is once every 2 years, then based off of other hardware OEMs, they have plenty of time to do both. 

I love the steam deck and what’s it has done for the market. I’m sure this is a hot take but it’s the reality we face. We need to look at what’s coming next and we do 100% need to consider other factors than itself, especially if they do end up coming into competition with it. (Important to note we’re still not sure since we don’t know price. But ASUS have claimed they will price it competition with the SD.)",SteamDeck
jhx7c9q,"> Asus ROG Ally will most likely be better in a lot of ways and that's ok 

Yes, I fully agree. SD is the best right now, has been for almost a year for me, longer for the first preorders. ARA will be on top for a while. Then I presume the SD2 will release.

Out here paying 200+ for mice and keyboards alone. 2k+ for a laptop. Sure, the Ally might outperform the Deck, but at what cost to your wallet knowing the trend of Asus ROG prices? I could arguably see them ranging from 800 to over 1k, especially if they do multiple models like SD did.

I still prefer the SD for the 4 customizable backpedal with trackpad. The smaller resolution is annoying when using Windows on it though. Even if you can get games with anti-cheat working on your SD unofficially, it is primarily because the developer/publisher is looking the other way and there's no guarantee they would not ban your account suddenly. You have to understand that and is willing to take the risk since there is no safety net.

If you rarely ever see yourself needing the 4 customized backpedal input nor mix input control (mouse + dpad), and play using vanilla controls with the occasional use to switch to mouse mode using the backpedal, the ARA is the superior options if you have the money. This is especially the case if you only plan on playing on Windows only, since there are games that can only run on Windows due to anti-cheats.

jhx4yd5,I just wouldn’t want to not have the touch pads and the extra two buttons on the back.,SteamDeck
jhx57az,"I bought the most expensive Deck at launch so I'm obviously aware that as time goes on, technology will offer better devices.

The Ally is also catered exactly to someone like me who is only interested in top of the line tech. 

What sold me is my trust in Valve to deliver a quality hardware product with great software to support it, and a phenomenal library.

To be honest, I trust Asus to also deliver a great product. And the Xbox game pass library is very enticing. I might just be interested in getting both and that's great. Handheld PC market is in a fantastic place",SteamDeck
jhx5rk7,"From my perspective - while having multiple Windows handhelds including Steam Deck

- price doesn't really matter for those who want them
- Steam OS allows true wake from sleep just like on the Switch. Windows 11 struggles with this
- Steam Deck integrates Steam Input masterfully. Vast options for control
- Gyro in Windows sucks. It works but not as smoothly as on the Steam Deck.
- trainers / cheat engine / plitch / we mod / mods / fluffy manager / etc will work easily on a Windows machine
- play all games from different launchers easily
- battery will not be worse or better in the Ally vs the Deck. I expect it to last at least 2hrs while gaming. I have the Win Max 2 that has a 1600p screen and I can play Assassin's Creed Valhalla on it for over 2hrs with no problem. The Win Max 2 has 6800U which is a less efficient chip compared to the Ally's Z1 Extreme, I expect the Ally to be better in terms of battery.
- looking at the motherboard, it seems a 2242 SSD can be ""fitted"" in",SteamDeck
jhx5sbs,"I am hyped about the ally. I wont be getting it because i have only had the steam deck for a little while, and only got it for a retro emulation device that cam do some modern gaming. 

And it does what i need with great results. 

I wont be upgrading for another cycle or two, unless i break something. 

But i am hoping this is the start of a emerging market of affordable and capable devices.",SteamDeck
jhx5ta6,"If there’s one thing I learned from using Asus ROG parts in my high end PC build, it’s that their hardware is awesome, but there support is some of the WORST I have experienced in any industry, period.

jhx5yfn,"I do not regret getting a Deck a few weeks ago, I still personally would rather buy from Steam themselves because it feels like it guarantees the least hassle-free Steam experience for me. But I also understand I’m an outlier in the community — I literally just use the Deck as a handheld PC, and do nothing outside of just run Steam games on it.",SteamDeck
jhx7x6g,"In some way I’d rather it be better spec wise and competitively priced as competition is good. The steam deck will look like the bargain in comparison and will grow the base.

I’d personally with my money rather not have some thing that is a spec beast in a handheld as that isn’t the way I’d want to play primarily. It takes away the sparkle of what the deck is with steamOS and emulation. Just doesn’t seem cool to be like “yeah but I can play that AAA game on the bus at max specs for an hour” to me…",SteamDeck
jhx7z6w,I'd get this if they produced a lot more eGPUs and made them significantly cheaper.,SteamDeck
jhx8b75,"I don't really worry much about the ROG ally because I don't see myself spending too much in a device like this. I think 450£ max is a good limit for a handheld. Anything higher than that probably cover a different market. Also, the community behind the SD is important and for some people is the reason to choose one or another. Not to mention the lack of trackpads... It leaves out the 60% of games I normally play on the deck.",SteamDeck
jhx8cbp,Seeing price reports of 659 or something like that,SteamDeck
jhx8g3s,"That LTT vid about the Ally dropped literally like two days after I put in my order, so I was a tad annoyed, especially about the higher refreshrate.

Then again we still don’t know the release date or how much this will cost, so we shall see. What I am really wondering about as well is controlling the desktop with the Ally, it doesn’t seem to have any mouse-esque type of abilities?

jhx8rje,"The Steam Deck is a neat little device. The integration with Valve services and most importantly, the lower price will still be important factors for the Steam Deck sales and Asus can't really compete with that. The Steam Deck is not the first handheld PC device but being affordable is what makes it so popular.

But overall, more competition means that the Steam Deck 2 (or whatever it will be called) will have to significantly improve the recipe, and that's quite good news.

If the Ally is better performance-wise after all and you are ready to spend more money for it, well just buy it.

But personally, I had a lot of issues with Asus devices being poorly designed (electronic-wise) so I will not buy it. Also, the Steam Deck is already enough for me...",SteamDeck

But I have a deck, and I love it. I won't be upgrading to the Ally any time soon because I'm satisfied with my SD. Unless someone buys me an Ally, I'm completely content with sticking to my deck. 

Perhaps the next gen of handheld PC's will get me to upgrade. But we'll see. 

TLDR: You're right and the Ally will be better. Which there is nothing wrong with that.",SteamDeck

jhxa34r,"Does a console that costs twice as much and is produced year and a half after the original can be called ‘better’? Of course. Will it provide better experience? We shall see. 
- The fps would probably see 20-30% improvement with everything else the same. 

- Battery life may be the same or worse (Steam Deck is super efficient at lower wattage). 

- Absence of trackpads may be a problem for games that require mouse.

- 1080P display may be slightly sharper at 1080 resolution, but don’t expect to play games in 1080p and expect the same FPS as Steam Deck that plays games in 800p. Maybe the most simplistic arcade games would be playable at that resolution, but any graphics demanding games would need to be scaled back to 720p to be playable. 

- ASUS support have been famously poor with their gaming laptops, but we shall see how they are going to handle gaming consoles that are a different product line. Just don’t set your expectations very high.

- Where we will see the biggest improvement is in games played while plugged in. New AMD chipset can provide a really good 1080p experience on a big screen when it can flex it’s muscles at maximum wattage. So if you play a lot of the games at home on a big screen, upgrade from Steam Deck would be probably your best option.",SteamDeck
jhxa556,"Biggest miss for me is at least the touchpad. I find that the Steam-button + touchpad for a quick mouse action is essential if you want to run titles that are not optimized to a t for console gaming.

jhxbb2u,"Having actual competition in the market by bigger brands is a good thing - it legitimizes the segment and will lead to more focus on interfaces that take advantage of the strengths of the form factor.  At a minimum, more devices like this will push Microsoft to focus on more handheld-friendly UIs (assuming that most of the Deck competitors choose to ship with Windows instead of using something like SteamOS).

Regardless of what the market looks like a few years from now, Valve definitely laid the foundation for what these types of devices should look and act like.  Nobody would be making sub-$1k handheld gaming PCs if Valve hadn't taken the leap first.",SteamDeck
jhxbd4l,"This might be stupid on my part. I didn't NEED the Steam Deck, but I wanted it to exist. So my Steam Deck purchase was for a vote with my wallet vs. a purchased need. Good portable gaming and a bonus is that it is on Linux.  I do use it from time to time, but I am super happy to see other competitors arise.  IMHO, my biggest problem is not being able to play game-pass games on the device without an internet connection or having to dual boot.",SteamDeck
jhxbm0t,"It's down right tempting and will make a true disruption to both the steam deck and entry level gaming laptops.  I just think the people who already play tethered to a power adapter will reap the real benefit.

ASUS is treating it like a gaming laptop, so the portability vs mobility eternal argument continues.",SteamDeck

Said that, Ally is different category altogether - it aims at handhelds like GPD Win3 rather than SD imo, thus not really competing directly.",SteamDeck
jhxe7tq,"I don't really see it as competition. Yea, it'll be better performance wise but it will also cost a ton more, making it a very premium option and that's fine for those that want more power than the SD can put out but most people are happy with the SD performance and probably don't want to shell out 1k+ on a handheld.

It will also likely be missing many QOL features that the SD deck has though, like trackpads, high control customisation etc.",SteamDeck
jhxe8vb,Another good handheld would be good for the market. I'm hoping someone can manage to create a piece with similar aspects that can actually compete in the 400$ price range. This would be amazing.,SteamDeck
jhxeckd,Out of my price range though and totally happy with my Deck. Only use it for work.,SteamDeck
jhxeswl,"Will nobody mention that the best part of StemDeck is the presence of 2 trackpads and all the configurability that steam provides for the controller?

I'm not a linux user and dealing with SteamOS is a pain in the ass sometimes so I won't defend it.

I tried putting windows on my SteamDeck(256gb btw) and I was really surprised by the fact that trackpads and all related configurations still worked well for steam library games. After tinkering for a while I moved back to SteamOs because I wanted to apply controller configurations to all my games (GW2, DA:Inquisition, etc).

Assuming that money is not a problen, I think Asus ROG Ally will be a better option for people that only wants to play games with native xbox controller compatibility, but is really far from being the ""steam deck killer"" that the media announce.",SteamDeck
jhxeuve,"It's a good thing for the ally to be better.  Not only does competition create innovation,  but also steam still benefits from it either way because it's the biggest storefront.  

Steamdeck paved the way for these handheld pc consoles, and I look forward to see what else valve releases but also what other devices come along from competitors",SteamDeck
jhxf0al,"Finally a sane take. This shouldn’t be console wars. We’re all playing the same games and there aren’t exclusives. The further handheld hardware is pushed, and the more reason for companies to be competitive on power, price, etc., the more we as consumers win.",SteamDeck
jhxf2wp,"I see this as a good thong for the market, need competition to spur on progress.

Plus I like to think this will open up the steam deck to actually have native and straightforward support for other pc marketplace because I gotta admit I'm not great with this manual proton system and control incompatibility with some games",SteamDeck
jhxf34g,One of the best things about the SD is the pause on demand. I can shut it off and pick it up 3 days later and pick up exactly where I left.,SteamDeck
jhxf38b,"Yeah, exactly. You think the Deck is good? Just wait until NVidia partners with whomever to make a competitor to the Ally, and Valve comes back with a souped-up OLED Deck, and then Microsoft gets into it with a whole new generation of chips and then...and then...

This is *exactly* what we want.",SteamDeck
jhxfchi,"No doubt the ally will have better performance and some decent features.  

However steam deck has its own features that are better than the ally and also performs exactly the same with current software as the day I got it.

Asus need to do much better if they want my money.",SteamDeck
jhxfgxm,"The Ally looks great from a spec perspective. I do thing the Deck wins in:

* Trackpads
* Community (tbd for the Ally)
* SteamOS (Windows is more of a resource hog but obviously has its own advantages)",SteamDeck
jhxfobg,"It’s just the stupid console war mentality. Sadly the handheld community won’t be immune to it, but that’s just how things are.",SteamDeck
jhxfspk,"The Steam Deck is doing exactly what it was supposed to, develop a new platform and encourage other manufacturers to enter that arena. Especially since Valve/Steam is more a software service, if others develop hardware it runs on it's still a win for them.

Kinda like (I imagine) Tesla in its early days. Yes they may have been the first to develop electric cars, but they've proven demand and now others are getting in on it.

This is one of the good sides of capitalism.",SteamDeck
jhxfwin,"The pros of Ally

* Competition
* More PCs in kids hands. Mobile gaming platforms and streaming services (Netflix, Amazon, Google) are threats to a healthier gaming. Android and IOS store conditions kids to accept predatory practices, developers use psychology to prey on kids. The kids then give their money to these bad actors and grow their business. They then migrate their greedy tentacles to PC. Nothing against gaming on mobile or streaming, just that companies that poison gaming get growth and money to expand that way.
* You can install SteamOS on it
* Pressures Nintendo to open up their hardware i.e not have alot of restrictions in what you can do with the hardware.

The cons of Ally

* Asus seems to have partnered with Microsoft, I assume Microsoft is subsidizing the low price of Ally in order to protect Windows dominance and promote Xbox/Game Pass. As long as Linux market share is low it will act as a detergent for developers from supporting it. Ally sales will boost Windows market share, staling or slowing down Linux market share. This is bad because if Linux reaches better market share quicker, developers will be quicker to enable anticheat for Proton which would make their multiplayer games run on SteamOS.

I am a proponent of Linux but I'd take Windows (PC) being adopted more over closed handhelds like Switch and mobile gaming with it's toxic and predatory game design. Not saying Switch is toxic like mobile platforms, I just like open platforms that let's you have as much freedom as reasonably possible.",SteamDeck
jhxgi56,"I’m glad there’s competition but there are too many things about the Ally that eliminate it as a purchase for me personally. I know most people will overlook these things but I won’t.

The ugly design, offset thumbsticks, Armory Crate interface (has anyone used Armory Crate on PC? It’s not a good piece of software), having to use Windows 11, etc.

It’s just not something I would buy, even if the Steam Deck didn’t exist.",SteamDeck
jhxgiac,Except for controller layout. I don't like the Switch layout because you have to coke up on the right to use that joystick and it's terrible for my hand. It's probably nowhere near as bad as the Switch but I still much prefert how the Deck handles the layout.,SteamDeck
jhxgtji,"Honestly, if it pushes valve to improve the deck and encourages miss competition in this field, it's nothing but a win. I'd love to have a ton of options when the time comes to upgrade my current deck.",SteamDeck
jhxgz0b,Yes but it's significantly more expensive,SteamDeck
jhxh0l9,It looks cool but it's hard for me to part with money so aslong as my steam deck can play the fighting games I buy so I can dock sd in living room to play with friends or take deck with me to dock at someone else's setup I'll be using it till the wheels fall off lol,SteamDeck
jhxh4xw,"Competition is absolutely a good thing, but I'm always gonna go for the closest to a Dualshock/Dualsense controller layout so I'd still prefer the Deck for that alone",SteamDeck
jhxh80g,"competition is a good thing, product isn't for me and that's okay. I'm happy with my purchase and I'm not gonna take away someone else's joy because of it",SteamDeck
jhxh92d,"Yeah it's really exciting but personally all I see it as is a way for valve to have some competition in the space even if it's better overall or in many ways its probably a pipe dream to think it would dethrone the steam deck.
Mostly because of the name and recognizeability that steam has people will likely gravitate to the SD unless they are enthusiasts or is the ally is fairly priced. 

Plus imo the ally is kinda ugly as hell",SteamDeck
jhxhaa5,"Competition in this market is good for consumers, just imagine if Steam v Asus gets big enough, it might force Nintendo to actually give the switch a good upgrade. Sony might bring back the PSP, the diversity of new handheld consoles will be amazing! The era of handheld gaming is surely returning!",SteamDeck
jhxhajo,"To my mind it’s nothing like a serious contender without the trackpads. As soon as I saw that my interest level went to zero. I mean I could probably bumble through on mouse games on joysticks but why would I want to when the Deck has these? I use them so often.

Secondly SteamOS is just so good and so configurable. Devs are really pushing to go Deck compatible. Will that be the case with the Rog? 

Not for me I think but as you say, competition is great.",SteamDeck
jhxhh76,"While competition good, one big point for me is the track pads. Why don't other developers see the benefit of trackpads? 

Either way, this is a win for Valve. More sales for them, and if they make a new gaming market of affordable gaming PCs, rock on!",SteamDeck
jhxi438,"Performance is not everything…
A Rog Ally will never be mine…",SteamDeck
jhxih9j,"Really though this is what valve wants. The SD is a way to showcase steamOS on portable devices and they make a little money and get good PR out of it. It has also been out a while. Technology is still changing at a very rapid pace, without iterations it will eventually lag behind.",SteamDeck
jhxilt0,"I think ROG Ally will cannibalize all the Aya NEO GPD and similar because it is better engineered and with low price, but the Steam Deck will be still viable because of the additional input and Steam OS",SteamDeck
jhxiqrk,Well said. More handhelds in the market is a good thing. I hope we start seeing more and more companies throw their hat in the ring. I’d love to see a dedicated Xbox handheld starting at $299 or something to really compete with Valve and the Deck.,SteamDeck
jhxjdkw,"The Ally is cool, I'll probably get one and love it.  However, the Steam Deck has been and will continue to be a fantastic adventure and will always hold a special place in my heart.  I expect the Ally to be more of what I'm already used to, a Windows PC in my hands.  And that's great.  But the Steam Deck taught me a considerable amount about Linux, about emulation, and about hardware and software customization. It got me excited to learn and reap the benefits of tinkering and tweaking.

I also brutally broke my arm in July 2021 and I pre-ordered my Steam Deck the day I got out of the hospital.  It was something I looked forward to for the following 8 months and 2 surgeries.  It arrived when I was still struggling with recovery, and it helped me immensely through a very dark time.  So, we bonded on a level that I don't expect will occur again 🙂",SteamDeck
jhxjlm7,Exactly I think people do not really understand that the real unmatched strenght of the SD is not it's performance but it's cost convenience. Many gamers just dont have (or dont want to spend) more than 500/600 dollars on a handheld no matter how powerful it is. Thats a big part of the reason why (in my opinion) the SD is so popular.,SteamDeck
jhxjn4p,I’m not interested in any handhelds that don’t run SteamOS perfectly at this point. And I’d also need all the same updates from Valve in a timely manner. Part of the Decks appeal for me is that it improves the UX of PC gaming dramatically. I don’t want to go back to a janky windows setup. There aren’t any games I want to play that can’t run on SteamOS. I’m limited only by hardware power. Maybe in some far flung future the windows handheld experience will be good enough but I’m not anticipating that happening in the next couple of years.,SteamDeck
jhxkl8g,The ONLY thing I've seen worse on the ally is the sheer number of inputs. It's across the board better except SD nailed the inputs.,SteamDeck
jhxkrkj,"The one way it's definitely not better is that it has the same controller layout as the switch with the right analogue stick directly under the face buttons which ergonomically for me (and others prob) is not comfortable. It's the main reason I don't play switch handheld, although I've just found hori do joycons with offset analogue sticks which for me is a gamechanger.

Steam decks layout is perfect for me, I don't care the B button falls off the side, it's infinitely more comfortable",SteamDeck
jhxksj9,Steamdeck 2 will be better too,SteamDeck
jhxktpu,"few things, in terms of screen and soc, its already miles ahead but thats not what 'portable' gaming is about for most of us. asus is a big hardware first corporation, valve isnt. this means when valve brings in people, its people who are there to contribute to a good, well thought out product (look at the vr headset), where as asus' people need a product that meets the specs, they may not care 'as' much about the user experience as valve. that also means no touchpads, fewer back buttons, less support for software etc. valve is a software first company, the deck is evolving to user needs, and the hardware was the same (affordable, ergonomic, caters to everyone), where as asus is aiming for fancy stuff even if it means many of the people cant buy (or use) it. its this difference in agenda that makes deck better imo,  like i'd be more than happy if ally had a better processor and a more 'color accurate' screen and touchpads and more back button and wouldnt care about a fast screen or all the rgb or dual fans etc etc but thats not what asus is going, its intentionally aiming for the niche and thats why deck is better, its aimed at everyone and its EXTREMELY WELL THOUGHT THROUGH wrt ergonomics and what a player would need to run old (and new) games on a portable device. like agenda during the reiterative processes matters when one is reiterating to to make preselected features fit and other is reiterating to see if the features even make sense and what can make the overall experience better (ie what would i do differently vs how i'd do whatever i'm already doing, differently)",SteamDeck
jhxkwgd,It's gonna have to be priced right imo. It's got solid specs but Asus likely can't afford to price like Steam Deck which hurts it imo. Unfortunately I am a baller on a budget so bang for the buck matters a lot to me.,SteamDeck
jhxkxqd,I am glad the ROG Ally exists due to the competition it will bring but it just seems overkill for handheld gaming.,SteamDeck
jhxl781,"Wrong, GPD Win 4 is obviously far better.",SteamDeck
jhxlh55,"The Asus ROG Ally has nice specs and will be able to natively run other game launchers and other windows apps which is nice. But I feel like windows brings other baggage with it. Steam Decks OS is the secret sauce, and the user experience will definitely still be better there. I’m sure Valve will come out with an upgraded Deck at some point, but for now you still can’t beat the value. Also… people complain about the Steam Decks battery…. How long will the Ally’s battery last while it sucks up more power to fuel it’s stronger APU? The extra performance does come at a cost (in more ways than one).",SteamDeck
jhxlxda,"Oh I love what I've been reading about the ROG Ally my only problems though is them having proprietary connectors and an attachment dock that's $2,000 I understand that it has a new generation video card in it but Jesus Christ.

jhxlzdw,A device that costs twice as much will have improvements? Who would have thought?,SteamDeck

Not that it really matters in the end as I paid for one here in Australia 😏",SteamDeck
jhxm5qt,No it won't be. It doesn't even have track pads that alone makes it not as good.,SteamDeck

jhxn4da,"I kinda want one if the rumor of $699 is true. It’s also apparently lighter and about the same as the Switch in terms of weight, but I wanna see battery numbers, this thing is running a full 1080p 120 HZ Display and even with FreeSync of there isn’t a way for me to control refresh rate I may not get it, cause I’d feel like taking a charger everywhere",SteamDeck
jhxn60k,"The more competitive these other devices are, the better Steam Deck 2 will be. Asus can’t support their device like Valve can theirs. It looks like a good option and I’m glad it exists.",SteamDeck
jhxnn2t,It doesn't have track pads and only has 2 back buttons. I'm too used to this now to go backwards even if the hardware is more powerful.,SteamDeck
jhxnn4x,"In terms of power, sure. Steam Deck is still going to have way more support which means it provides a better experience in that way. We also didn't spend $1000 for the thing.",SteamDeck
jhxnxa6,"So it’s going to be quite a bit more powerful, but pushing a 1080p screen I wonder how much of that extra power will go just to upping the resolution. I guess it’s always possible to drop the resolution though and really harness all that power. I don’t know if I would really notice too much of a drop in quality on a 7” screen and the extra power would be awesome.

jhxodsc,"There have been and will be more powerful and better spec'd devices than the steam deck.

jhxozew,"It's gonna be a lot more expensive.

The amount of flexibility the Deck has overall just can't be beat, and it will always be better at certain things.

We're just in the handheld PC's version of the console wars of old. But once things get even more powerful it'll come down to your choice in peripherals and software.",SteamDeck
jhxq1pl,"More the merrier I say. 

I like my SD, I use it everyday, but what I play on it... I don't need a stronger device. I have a gaming PC for that. 

In terms of bulk and size difference, I think the SD is fine. 

As long as you're not treating it like a gameboy sp or something. 

But even with this Asus... Would you really treat it any differently than a SD? I mean... It's smaller, but I feel like the use cases are identical.

I dunno. Chances are Asus won't be as competitive as the SD. Valve gets you in for 300 to 600 dollars.then makes 15 percent on games.

I know I look for games that would be good on the go, games I wouldn't play on my PC. 

But to the enthusiastic handheld gamer-- it might be worth it. 

I'm the guy that, if I bought a console, it would be last gens console. Maybe I'm not the market for the high end console/handheld. Then again, inhabe a 1080ti and all my games run fine. So. I dunno",SteamDeck
jhxq6no,"I don’t really agree.

Sure, the specs will be better and it will run windows without having to install it for those games that need it. For many games with controller mappings out of the box, you’ll get a nicer experience. But steamdeck is this crazy project to replace a gaming pc and have a whole host of games made for mouse and keyboard be a pleasant mobile experience.

So I would say that steamdeck is one kind of product, and the Ally is a different kind of product. They have some overlap, but the steamdeck is going to be way more versatile, hackable, and community supported. It’s apples and oranges, just like there’s no point in telling people that the steamdeck has better specs than a switch. Of course it does, but it’s not for the same audience.",SteamDeck
jhxq7hw,I think we are really seeing the beginning of an exciting time! I really love the concept of handheld pc gaming and I can’t wait to see what else we will be getting.,SteamDeck
jhxqh6c,"Will the ROG Ally have better specs and/or slimmer bezel etc? Yes. 

Will I care? No. 

Why? Because I bought the SteamDeck because of 2 + 1 things:

- I wanted a new PC for playing GuildWars 2 and for it being a mediabox on Linux without paying the Microsoft tax
- I was willing to pay a bit of extra so I could support Valve for all they are doing for linux gaming
- And it came with the added bonus of an already gaming optimized Linux install with any easy access to a store front out of the box

For me, the ROG Ally is no different then any high end, expensive gaming PC with Windows, I don't want it. 

I get that it could canibalize the niche that the Deck had carved for itself, and it saddens me that it might lead to Valve to dial back proton support 2-3 years from now if their endevour with the Deck fails, but I have been doing my desktop and exotic emulation gaming on Linux pcs since 2007, and will not change if the Valve Deck brand fails.",SteamDeck
jhxqngy,"The Asus ROG Ally will probably outperform the steamdeck in many ways. But that doesn't mean that it's better than the steamdeck in all ways. 

The biggest reason I would buy the ROG Ally would be the performance and the portable size of it. It looks sleek and good, can play more demanding games, and is quiet. Overall it seems like a very nice system. It runs windows as well making some older games easier to run. I have some games that can only play on windows and my windows partition on my steam deck borked.

The reason I will not buy it is entirely due to it not having touch sensors on the sticks, buttons on the back, and most importantly it does not have trackpads. The trackpads allows me to play a lot of more games comfortably, and it makes already comfortable games with a game pad more easy to control. You can use them as sliders, flick control, mouse, joystick, gyro enabler, buttons, and more. You can even combine these behaviours for even more natural control schemes leading to way better immersion among other benefits. In my honest opinion I can't move away from the steam deck only due to the trackpads. Heck, I play all my games on the pc with my steam deck as a controller because it feels so comfortable.

But moving away from its inferior controls, it's great competition, and that is welcomed any day. I'm overall excited and looking forward to see how this machine will be used and what tools people will build for it, despite me not going to buy it.

If they make a trackpad version with haptic feedback though I'll be really considering buying it or waiting.",SteamDeck
jhxqo4h,Acceptance. Y'all really went through the stages of grief,SteamDeck
jhxqtw5,"For my part, I just feel a little disheartened that the competition in this case is (what seems to be) an excellent hardware platform running an infamously anti-competitive software platform. I wish they had given the choice of SteamOS or Windows, and let users pick. But that might be on Valve and not releasing SteamOS publicly too.",SteamDeck
jhxr47o,"I still have no idea how they're going to sell this thing at a strong enough loss to be competitive with the Steam Deck. 

I use the Deck to play older games like Chrono Cross, Pixel Remasters, and anything up to ps2/gamecube graphics. 

I don't see this device having much more of a cost benefit to me based on my use-case. Most big AAA games I play on my PS5 or the stupidly expensive monitor on my desk.",SteamDeck
jhxrfue,The only reason the sd is better is because quality was sacrificed for price. By making what they made they can  provide a price that people can afford. The Asus has had a history of overpriced hardware. I can see the same being true for this device.,SteamDeck

The point is - this thing has real appeal to me so I'm not blind to it being a better option for me. Looking forward to more news about it.",SteamDeck
jhxtjfp,"I'm not worried. I love my SD, and I love those tactile touch pads on the sides.",SteamDeck

That’s the reason the steam deck is so popular, it didn’t really do anything new (from a hardware perspective) but what it did do is make it really affordable. If I’m wrong and asus prices it competitively then by all means. It’s probably not gonna change valves course because valve does what valve does.",SteamDeck
jhxtt5r,"I have my SD but am not completely infatuated like many here. I still primarily use my PC but love the ability to play in bed or on the go.

jhxvqg8,"The reason I like the deck is that it's hassle free.   
I mostly play indie games and some older titles on it, the most I've had to do was install ProtonUp to run some ""unsupported"" games.

I do not really like Linux and while SteamOS is actually pretty nice, it's still not as practical as Windows, so I'd rather not have to bother setting up stuff I'm not comfortable with.",SteamDeck
jhxw5me,Let's discuss this after Rog release. Now this is pointless conversation,SteamDeck
jhxwdgt,"I think people forget one of the strongest assets of the Steam Deck is it’s community. The folks that share their troubleshooting solutions, the people making plug-ins, and the openness of the developers. That alone justifies the purchase for me, regardless of wether the ASUS ROG ends up being a competitive handheld (and maybe even a preferable alternative to some use-cases)

If folks want to stay within the Steam ecosystem that is perfectly okay. No need to get all defensive about it, but it is the internet after all.",SteamDeck
jhxwe68,I'm just waiting for the steam deck 2 to come and kick everyone's ass again,SteamDeck
jhxwt6f,"My main concern is the Ally shipping with Windows, not with the device itself.  The Steam Deck is the Trojan Horse of Linux gaming.  It's a mass market device with a nice UI that gets a lot of console and PC gamers onto Linux that would not be using Linux otherwise.  I know Valve is selling them practically at cost, so if another device takes the spotlight Valve will still be fine.  However, the Steam Deck is the single biggest thing driving up the Linux numbers and if we want Linux to succeed as a gaming OS (and with the rate Microsoft is shittifying Windows 11 I think we absolutely need it to) then we need the Deck or other machines shipping SteamOS.

I kinda want to buy an Ally for OpenRGB development purposes and to run SteamOS on it.  The hardware looks great.  The software looks terrible.",SteamDeck
jhxxcee,"Doesn't the Ally run Windows? 

I can't speak for anyone else, but the pair of Decks I bought weren't to have the most powerful gaming devices; I have a pair of high-end gaming PCs for that. Purchasing the Decks was about putting my money where my mouth is regarding supporting gaming on Linux (or, really, just getting the industry moving away from Windows). 

In top of that, I constantly see people talking about ""Steam Deck killers"" which don't have what I consider to be the most identifying features of the SD, being the touch pads, additional back buttons, and ability to seamlessly map controls to everything from physical buttons to virtual menus. 

Without these things, all of these handhelds fail to even enter the arena with Valve and the SD in a meaningful way. Obviously performance per dollar can put pressure on Valve, and sure, some people won't care it runs Windows or has limited control options, but ultimately, this constant and drastic ""missing the point"" relegated these devices to Switch killers much more than long-term competition for Valve. 

Obviously success on any scale can allow for future revisions that more closely align with Valve's target audience, but even then, many people seem to overlook the colossal moat that Valve has in the form of first-party integration with the largest games distribution that's ever likely to exist. 

Relax. There will always be better performing handhelds; that doesn't invalidate your purchase any more than other people having faster cars than you. The Deck hits a market, and it does so so successfully that none of the ""killers"" even attempt to encroach on the featureset. 

Competition is healthy and ultimately good for consumers. Valve will be watching closely as to how more performant competitions affect their bottom line and will adapt accordingly. My guess, though, is that any of these competitors will remain rounding errors to Valve until we cross the threshold of AIO desktop replacements where controls and featuresets are offset by customizability of external peripherals and software.",SteamDeck
jhxxdtb,"People will still get many of their games on the ally via steam. Valve still wins either way.

I think the steam deck has some incredible software behind it that puts it above other handhelds, even ones with more power.",SteamDeck
jhxxlae,"It will have some crossover, but like the Switch have its own audience for the most part based on price point. Anything over £500 will price a lot of people out without some other exclusive reason to own the device. 

What the Steamdeck has is the name Valve behind it and the word steam in the title. The big draw is taking your Steam Library on the move and while other, newer devices will have the same capability without the number one point being front and centre it will struggler without another standout key feature. 

Don't forget - there has been a been a big handheld on the market for years with the Switch and it's not really in competition with the SD",SteamDeck
jhxy8vs,"The price is really where it competes. Nobody is going to buy the ally if it's 2× the PS5. If I wanted to spend 800+ on something to play games on, I would have much higher standards that the steam deck wouldn't be able to meet.",SteamDeck
jhxyn2a,Evolving and competition is a win for gamers in general... We all win... The Steam Deck is literally the first handheld that has captivated me and coaxed me into purchasing since the original Gameboy... This system gets everything right on so many different facets...

I certainly welcome this as the more actors in the handheld market appears the better the products will be. Because of trying to constantly improve upon what the competition is currently offering. 

For instance, do we need RGB? Well, it doesn't make it less cooler or be faster and or have better battery performance. But I love the detail and it's something I value. Same with the touchpads, I won't miss them, but like before, I'm sure someone does value the SD touchpads.

jhy7h7u,"I love steam os and how it functions and the deck itself. However, I also knew it was entry level for handheld pcs. For the price compared to the specs, it is well worth having for several years. Just pushing it to see what the SD is capable of running is fun, let alone playing the games. 

I do, however, know that eventually, I will have to get a new handheld. Unless the ROG Ally is comparable in price, I'm likely going to wait a few more years. Especially since AMD is just now coming out with an APU that's specifically designed for handheld pcs. 

Since Asus is primarily a hardware manufacturer, there's likely no benefit for them to lower the price as much as Valve did for the steam deck. Valve could at least make massive game sales due to the influx of deck users who otherwise wouldn't have bought games on steam. 

Unless GOG or one of the other game marketplaces make their own handheld, the other handhelds that likely come out will be far more expensive than the deck. So, I will wait for something that is truly powerful, yet manages to keep a 3 hour battery life, even if it is $1000, I will make sure it's worth that price. 

The GPD win 4 is on the right track, but I'll likely wait for their win 5 iteration. The win 4 so far has shown lacking battery life.",SteamDeck

If the ROG can beat the Steam Deck as a handheld, pricing and games compatibility - yes, it will be a major player, still leading an uphill battle because of being late on the market of handheld PCs. It may end up selling more than the Steam Deck in the long run, but either way the winner revenue-wise will be Valve. Asus makes money through hardware sales. Valve's strategy is much more nuanced - they are actively working towards creating a new market niche where they can sell software. It's like American football vs actual football (soccer). Yes, American football players (in that analogy Asus ROG) may have bigger muscles, and they may have a following in a specific niche, but Soccer is making big money worldwide.",SteamDeck

As much as I love Valve (I signed up for Steam in 2003), I'm not married to them, and as great as the Steam Deck is, the distribution network is... not great. ESPECIALLY outside of the US, where I am (non-EU Europe), getting one was super hard, or super expensive, or both.

So with Asus distribution network, they have a good chance of growing the market and give Valve a run for their money.

Valve doesn't sell Steam Decks, they sell games. They give you a game store and an entry-level device. That's it. It is up to others to push the limit.

The ROG is going to be better than Steamdeck you say? Great. Gabe will sell some AAA games for it.

Every another Steam-based console will spill gold on Valve.

Valve doesn't need to compete with top hardware manufacturers and they won't do it. Every gamer should clearly understand the simple fact: over years, there will be more and more steamdeck-ish stuff, and all of it will overcome the original SD at every parameter. Very soon it will be too boring to start another topic on Reddit once another new console gets released.

You say, something delivers more FPS than the SD?

Yup cool.

All in all I would be happy if there was some sort of community SteamOS port for the thing.

So the prices of the 6800u handheld range from 800-1300 I guess they could get away with anywhere between 1300 - 1500 I don't think I'll be giving up my steam deck anytime soon until we can get close to 2060 levels of performance on handheld,SteamDeck
jhz8zwx,"I mean yeah, there's a lot of ways the Ally could be better. Except for price. Steam is taking a loss on these units, but they'll make it back with software bought. Asus doesn't have that luxury. I'd be shocked if it's under 1200.",SteamDeck
jhz92in,"I think the Ally is great! It's been the first one of these Post-Steam-Deck-PC-Handhelds that I actually believe in and I think could rope in more of the casual audience! I still think the Steam Deck, with the trackpads, and Steam Input and such has the hardcore audience that likes to tinker around. Ally seems more tailored to ""high-end gaming"" vs the Steam Deck's all-around approach. I think the Ally will drain battery too fast for lower-end games, but it'll also be good for those who want to play AAA games or for those who are more comfortable with Windows. From what I've seen so far, that's my take. I hope the price doesn't disappoint.",SteamDeck
jhz932j,"Is normal that better devices are released. New tech is now available since the launch of the SD. The concept has been proven by the SD, so of course others will want to join the party. 

We can’t realistically expect the SD to stay on top forever. It’s basically a PC… and this has always been the problem with PC gaming vs console gaming. PCs are constantly being updated, it’s a much more dynamic ecosystem. 

Heck, when the SD 2 gets released, which could happen anytime, the SD won’t be the top dog anymore.

There’s absolutely no reason to expect the SD to be the best and greatest…

Even with the Deck, I am still finding myself wishing for a couple more buttons on the back just to really fine tune my control scheme.

ji076pn,I highly doubt the ROG Ally will even come close to a competitive price with the steam deck considering ROG probably won’t be selling at a loss like Valve.

SteamDeck running the same game native at med high settings =40 frames pulling less than half the power. You can’t have your cake and eat it too with the ROG. More resolution means it needs more graphic processing power to do the same work. They have straight up said you can’t utilize the 140hz refresh rate with the graphics card that is in the Ally.

No trackpads, back buttons, no SD card and smaller frame. It’s the kinda device that could gain by losing some features. I love my trackpads for certain games, but I’d happily buy an SD light for just something nicer to hold and look at.

However wait till the ASUs reviews. Yes it’s running windows but SD is a console experience I’d say.

The problem is, Asus is a hardware manufacturer while Valve owns a game distribution platform. If both are required to make hardware revenue out of software, Valve would take the lead. Just like how consoles can be sold cheap and also recoup the loss through game sales. With no platform, Asus would need to try a lot harder to compete with Valve. This includes going down the route of artificially limiting the stock to keep loss low, and open the flood gate once the hardware became obsolete enough.

ji1n0fh,"One thing I don’t actually like about the ROG is the FullHD screen. I’d rather have a lower res with better performance / more shelf life.

Its a handheld, performance still isn’t going to be anything close to modern PCs so I’d rather skip on resolution than sacrifice the frames.",SteamDeck
ji1qvty,"Yes but can it load 100 mods onto skyrim? I doubt it, as its not a PC.",SteamDeck
ji1sd31,I didn’t know that Asus was making a thing? I’ll have to look into it,SteamDeck
ji1u3wv,"I may be in the minority, but I'll take the touchpads over the Rog' improvements ANY day of the week.  If I have to go back to 1974 style controller aiming I'll probably just not buy another handheld. With that said my hopes are that Valve doesn't take this lying down and makes the Steam Deck 2 nice and beefy, competition is good.",SteamDeck
ji1uofi,"Steam has a warranty system I can actually trust, for one. I broke my screen on the ROG 1 phone and to get it replaced was $300. It took over 8 months and they didn't even fully repair the device, the screen was still wonky, and now the RGB and NFC functions do not work. 

We also don't know how user-serviceable it is, but knowing ASUS it will be very minimal (I'm guessing joystick replacement only, if even). So... $400 for a 64gb and slightly ""lower spec"" or an extra $300 for the upgrade. I don't think the SD is out of the competition, I think the 512gb one would probably be the most hurt by the Ally, since it's comparing only a $100 price difference. Depends on if there are tiered models or not though.

Overall I feel that they're pretty different devices all around. Seems silly but... The Steam Deck has trackpads which greatly expand its capabilities as a regular computer. The Steam Deck really is a computer first and foremost outside of gaming it really shows that it wants to do anything you want it to. The Ally not having trackpads won't be a dealbreaker for gamers but it will certainly make using the device more difficult (plus, more options are never bad.) Basically, I'm thinking the ROG Ally is really more of a competitor to the Switch experience having PC hardware, whereas the Steam Deck is just trying to be a handheld PC that just so happens to compete with the Switch. All 3 are portable handhelds, but each are trying to do something different. The Switch is trying to play games. The ROG Ally is playing games. And the Steam Deck is a portable PC that can play games.",SteamDeck
ji1wb62,"Hi guys!! a lot of reading here!! but no one has talked about the big elephant in the room, battery/autonomy.

Any device could be more powerful than SD, using AMD though like Ally, but vantage points will be Batter y and price, and the first is crucial to a daily basis play.",SteamDeck
ji1ykqo,"Maybe some of specs are better. But ROG Ally  doesn't have touch panels.   
And it will cost way more expensive:  
Valve can afford to sell SD with zero profit. They will earn money by selling games at Steam.  
ASUS must take some profit from the device. Beacouse it is their the only profit. 

But in general, I think it is good news that the market of handheld consoles will not be monopolised by Valve. As more options we will have as better quality and price/specs options we will receive.",SteamDeck
ji21vro,"The ROG Ally is the first console to come from an experienced hardware manufacturer. Sadly it looks like the most generic, made in China, white labelled handheld I've seen yet. It's ugly. I'm not a fanboy of the Steam Deck. I think it's well designed, but not very beautiful either. The Aya Neo Air series, though....",SteamDeck

ji221t9,"We’re at a point with technology where “better” isn’t as objective as it used to be. It may well be more powerful, but is that better? When the inputs are objectively worse by simply being less, is that more powerful device “better”? If the cost is higher, if the battery life is worse due to that power, if the OS is worse, if access to power users is less, if parts are less available, is the other unit really “better”?

What we do with a device, and what it lets us do, isn’t nothing. Even though it doesn’t fit on a spec sheet.",SteamDeck

jhx88si,"Another thing I didn't get to highlight is that with regards to game compatibility, the inability for the Steam Deck to play games that have multi-player due to anti-cheat software not playing nice with linux/proton is a big issue that hasn't been solved yet.  This is a major Sream Deck weakness at the moment. 

The ability of being able to play Fornite, Destiny 2, COD, GTA online,  or other popular online games on the go with no issues is extremely valuable in and of itself.  This feature can be the deciding factor for people deciding between the Ally and the Deck.  

The Steam Deck is a great 1st gen device that has given birth to a sort of new class of gaming tech.",SteamDeck

jhx22pt,This isn't necessarily true. The big reason Valve made a push themselves into making their own handheld hardware was to increase market share of Linux gaming. Valve put a lot of R&D money into Proton to ensure gaming on Linux was viable. More systems that come with Windows by default that compete against Valve's Steam Deck and other competitors that use Linux by default is really going against this pursuit that Valve started. Valve really dislikes the Microsoft Windows hegemony.,SteamDeck

jhytp5g,Yeah like you can try to sell me a super PC in the size of the switch but with no trackpads I'll skip out. Tons of games I play on the deck would not be possible if I didn't have the track pads. Imo not having them really soft locks the games you'll be able to play,SteamDeck
jhy5h0r,"Yeah. I don't use them much but they're essential for some games. Same with the back buttons, though like 90% of the time I just rebind L3 and R3 to them so having 2 instead of 4 might be okay. Dual action triggers though, that'd be nice.

jhyl39s,"This just sounds like cope. I’ve been using windows since I was a kid. Never had it “shit the bed”. Even so, a simple factory reset would fix any issues that pop up. I have two decks, one with steam OS and one with Windows. This idea that Linux gamers have that windows is just this power hungry OS that itself will eat battery is just paranoia. I play the same games on both. Games that get shit battery life (90-120 minutes) do so on both Steam OS and Windows. Games that get better battery get around the same on both OS’s. 


Performance is 99% the same, with windows getting the lead on non-steam games. In my experience running non steam games on Steam OS using heroic, Lutris, or even installing as a non steam app, leads to worse performance vs native steam titles sometimes.

I would reply that that insofar as game developers are developing specifically for handhelds anyway, they're not going to be targeting the top few percent of what is already a comparatively niche market.  The Steam Deck has an installed customer base that will, as a matter of practicality, greatly exceed that of the new gen handhelds.  

To put it in perspective, while this week a lot of us have been *talking* about the Ally, Valve will have *sold* another \~20,000 - 40,000 Steam Decks (assuming \~1-2M a year; pick other numbers if you prefer).  I frankly think it will be quite a while before Asus even stops the gap growing, let alone starts to catch up.

ji0l4vg,That's true but game developers won't really target either the steam deck or ally for performance.,SteamDeck
jhyfbef,"Well the whole point of it being the *Steam* Deck is that it's made to access Steam, which specifically exists to keep on supporting games long after they would normally be abandoned.  That's one of the big reasons for the Deck's success:  extremely easy access to vast library of older, indie and other less demanding games that will run well on lighter hardware.

So Valve will probably want to add another layer for the verification flags.  Anything which is verified or playable for the Mk1 Deck will *ipso facto* be verified or playable for the Mk2.  

So Valve could just add a nice shiny number to the flag icon, showing the lowest model number that it applies to.  If you see a ""Playable (**2**)"" then you know it needs at least a SteamDeck 2 to be playable.  IDK, something like that?

Anyway, I agree with your base point - a 3-4y or so refresh cycle sounds about right given the pace of development - that's about 2 CPU generations and maybe 1-2 GPU generations.  And it's probably going to fit well with the expected median lifespan of the Deck.",SteamDeck

I also don't get the problems some people seem to be having with SteamOS.

The Steam Deck is a single player beast. My son plays multiplayer with his but only docked. The kind of games that are blocked due to anti cheat are the games least suited to handheld in my opinion.

Obviously it depends what you are into but there are a lot of games that require a track pad. I bought an indie early access game earlier this week, Shadows of Doubt. It's great and it has controller support and the controller support works for 80% of what you do and for the other 20% it is *so* frustrating until you switch to a mixture of controller and trackpad.

That's a couple of clicks and can be done in game on the Deck. If I only owned an Ally I probably wouldn't have risked it or I would have risked it and wasted my money and time.

They built so many careers and studios.

&#x200B;

While getting massively rich.

&#x200B;

SteamDeck is likely that. A way to penetrate the market the Switch has, bring PCs into handheld, and create a whole audience they were missing... and I wouldn't be shocked if in a few years SteamDeck is like CS:GO--just one of many, even if a damn good and popular one. But it paved the way. That's just good for gamers, and like others said, Steam profits anyway as it will sell more games thanks to more ppl buying on Steam.",SteamDeck
jhyceiq,"I will say, that while you're correct, Valve's lootbox economy has always been FAR more consumer friendly than most alternatives. In almost all of their games (outside of TF2 and, I suppose, Artifact) the only things you can get through boxes are cosmetic. There's no gameplay advantages through them, and no pay-to-win mechanics. A lot of other games miss this part of it, and come across as much more greedy by pressuring players to buy boxes, rather than encouraging them because they want to support a product.

Case in point for me is Dota vs League of Legends. I have over a thousand hours in both, but LoL restricts so much gameplay content (champions and previously runes) behind pay or time walls. Dota is balanced around the fact that every hero is available to everyone, and your knowledge/ability is what limits your draft choices, not what characters you have unlocked. I usually spent money in LoL because I HAD to, to unlock a character I was interested in, rather than just wanting a cool cosmetic in Dota and feeling good about my purchase.

I think that Valve, while wanting to make money (of course they do), keeps in mind that goodwill and faith in them not screwing over the customer (not saying that doesn't happen from time to time) earns them a lot more in the long run than trying to nickle and dime customers for a short gain, EA style.",SteamDeck

Im only worried about availability of the product after launch. Valve made a good decision with the preorder like stuff, everybody could get their hands on the product. What is going to prevent scalping in the first place? Because interest is great in the product.

But all things considered, i'm not going to purchase it, i'm more then happy with my deck for the foreseeable future.",SteamDeck
ji1c8gt,"Two things. First, the fact that Steam OS provides options for all of that stuff while Big Picture does not, means that Big Picture mode quite literally isn't the same exact experience in terms of use or features compared to Steam OS, as there are differences between experiences, full stop. Secondly, if your argument for a handheld experience requires connecting a mouse to do stuff, *that* is a non argument as it's not addressing anything tied to a gaming handheld experience. What if you decide to connect your device externally to play docked, and you aren't using it with a mouse but just an external controller? At that point it falls apart with just Big Picture mode, where as SteamOS fares fine in that scenario on a handheld like the Deck (or other devices).

Big Picture does not do those things on Windows, and methods for doing similar stuff on Windows mostly are either done through third party apps or driver clients (based around a regular desktop experience), or from applications which provide the same functionality, while lacking in other areas (like apps designed purely for the controls for the handheld directly, yet aren't feasible for the external gamepad control context). Some stuff (like automatic scaling as how it's performed on SteamOS, complete with control over it on a per-app basis, regardless if the app is full screened or not) simply isn't provided like that. Seamless, controller-based multitasking is not a thing, unless you somehow consider forcing mouse emulation, and alt-tabbing *seamless* (it's not). This isn't even getting into Big Picture not working for certain games which offer other overlay clients which inject into apps similarly (such as EA games for example), which means at times potentially losing out on Steam Input and the menu when launching those games.",SteamDeck
jhxildm,"This is true, but having the option, when push comes to shove, to drop the resolution from Full HD to HD, matching a Switch or Steam Deck, is a plus.  I'm comfortable with 720p being the bare minimum resolution for playing AAA games on a handheld device if it means I can play most things, including Cyberpunk at a stable 40fps or even 60fps.",SteamDeck
ji3mzqf,Yea I absolutely love my deck so there’s nothing really to complain there. The only thing that seems suspect to me about the ally is no gyro. Such a cheap and simple addition that seemed to be ignored. May make or break my purchase,SteamDeck
jhxzvb2,"Steam sells you a license, which you've clearly misinterpreted as selling you the game itself. You don't own your Steam games, and if Steam shuts down you will need to pray that there is an amicable solution that allows you to continue to utilize your license.

Microsoft is renting you the license. I think this is a more honest portrayal of your ownership of the game - you don't own anything with GamePass, but everyone is aware of what's going on.

With game ""ownership"" there is this song and dance where the customer thinks they're buying a game, but the seller thinks they're selling a license.

My preferred approach is to rent games via GamePass until they become available on GOG, at which point I can download the actual game files to my computer so even if the terms of the license change, nobody can enforce that upon me.

I try not to ""buy"" from Steam unless there are no other viable alternatives, and when buying from Steam I am resigned to the fact that it's more like a long-term rental.",SteamDeck

I don't really condone PC game piracy anymore because Steam does a good job, but if Steam went away the option at least still exists (in contrast to cloud gaming like Stadia which is the worst of the worst, you own absolutely nothing not even files on your hard drive).  Thing is, I don't see Valve going away anytime soon and if we keep buying Steam games that will remain the case.",SteamDeck

I don't expect the game to run at full quality 60fps on the Deck, but the game struggles with moderate settings on my desktop PC which is far better spec'd.

Oddly changing the settings to Medium and High also seem to hit 20 fps, which makes no sense. So at its current state, people should absolutely avoid this on Steam Deck.

I've literally tried disabling everything as well with  FSR only on, and nothing raises the FPS above 20. Only things I haven't tried is different proton versions.",SteamDeck

Apparently there's an SMT update as well, should help with emulators.

My setup is nothing special, I have not touched immutable FS or installed anything that could interfere, I believe. I had decky but it was the first thing I uninstalled to test. 

The problem is that the gaming mode is too dark too, but can be remediated with brightness slider (gamma here is OK, it seems). 

Not sure, if the brightness slider values have changed, but I feel like once I achieve similar visibility as it was before, the leds are too bright (still doesn't *feel* right).  

In desktop mode the gamma is set to 1 (which is too dark), the brightness level carries over but doesn't help. I set gamma to 2.35 and it's ok, but doesn't fix the problem in gaming mode. If I go back to desktop mode, the gamma would be wrong again: it's set to 2.35 and it's too much (the colors are washed out), so if I set it back to 1 it looks right again. I go to GM and back to DM and the gamma set to 1 is too dark. 

If there is any other way I could help to troubleshoot it, send logs, open an issue, please let me know.

Even though I'd seen a bunch of videos before ordering I was still kinda shocked by how big it was when it arrived, lol. It's mostly comfortable when I'm playing at home (except occasionally when I hold it in a bad position and get cramps/stiff arms), but recently I took it on holiday and didn't want to use it at all in my cramped plane seat and just read a book instead.

I'm unlikely to get the Asus Rog Ally anyway just because I already have a Steam Deck now, but if I hadn't bought one the smaller size and weight would definitely be a big plus point in its favour.

* No Windows (yes, that is a feature to me)

ji0g89r,"I have tiny hands and it's way too big for me to play handheld, much prefer the switch. But I realise I'm the minority so it's nice people like it",SteamDeck
ji0ifoh,"I honestly dont find the ergonomics that great. It all comes down to the weight. Maybe if i got a grippy case or something it would be better, but as it is now i dont find the deck very comfortable because I feel like I have to fight to keep it in my hands unless its resting on my chest or lap",SteamDeck
ji0cjew,"Im probably the minority, but i hate the ergonomics. It's way too big imo. In a prefect world with no thermal limitations, it would be the size of a switch. One thing that's really attractive about some competitors is the form factor.",SteamDeck
jhyjul8,Yeah it is bulkier than say a Switch but it's more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time,SteamDeck
jhyljk1,"Amen brother.  The deck’s ergonomics don’t get mentioned much, but I sure keep getting impressed by them every time I play with it. So comfy.",SteamDeck
jhymf6p,"Not only does it have the best ergonomics I ever used for a handheld besides the psp, and ds, especially due to the non Xbox control layout, it has isolated grips(not many people seem to mention this), so no matter how hot the device gets, the grips will never even reach that far, sometimes they can even be cold since the only heat is outside sources or how hot the whole device gets",SteamDeck
jhzyhwu,"Statistically, probably not the only one.",SteamDeck
ji0cyms,"I like how big it is. Fits my hands well. Almost well enough to put two fingers on top of each side lol

Almost. I do like the back buttons.",SteamDeck
ji0e2i2,"Ngl, I’ve noticed mine slips to a weird angle pretty often. I was going to get a case for it, but I just bought an Xbox controller instead. An added benefit when I’m replaying Ace Combat and repeatedly fail the Same. Fucking. Mission.",SteamDeck
ji0eiq9,It is the perfect device for my hamhands.,SteamDeck
ji0nskw,I think it feels nice in my hands but it’s awkward to have my hands so far apart. I’ve never played switch but I did play the psp many years ago and I enjoyed it. Maybe it’s because I’m so aggressive with my controllers but it feels like I’m going to break the steam deck screen when playing.,SteamDeck
ji0t3o2,"Can’t say I’m a fan of the ergonomics myself. I feel like the the bottom half of the grips should flair out more so that my wrists stay at a neutral angle. 


The sides being completely flat and the overall weight of the device puts some strain on my wrists after an hour or so. 


Beyond that, it’s very comfortable in the hands.",SteamDeck
ji0u8ci,Personally I hated the positioning of the back pad buttons. They are in a very uncomfortable place if you use your pointer and middle finger for L and LT at the same time. The Ally looks like it have better positioning for those buttons,SteamDeck
ji0ufeo,"I have large hands and i agree with you, i cant get over how great it feels",SteamDeck
ji0w88b,"I agree, the ergonomics are surprisingly good and a great feature. I can't do the flat slab style handhelds that Nintendo is known for, makes my hands and wrists cramp up after 30-45 minutes. When I had a Switch I had to buy a large grip thing for it to stop my hands from cramping, which makes it basically the same size as the Steam Deck.",SteamDeck
ji1318a,"Yeah, it's really great and it kinda worries me about the ROG Ally, that looked significantly less ergonomic, but we'll see when it hits the market off course.
I'd still maybe like a little smaller next version of steam deck, but surely keep the trackpads, so I'm not sure how much Valve can make it smaller",SteamDeck
ji13d6k,*especially* after playing on switch for so long. Joy cons are the worst,SteamDeck
ji14go6,"It was one of the few worries I had about it before buying. Turns out, at least for my hands, it's a lot better than the Switch.",SteamDeck
ji14z59,As a person with rather small hands I always feel like I have to reach for the sticks haha,SteamDeck
ji1b0rw,"Yes. Yes you are…

Joking aside, for such a big device, it’s really comfortable to hold and play with. Still not as good as the WiiU controller but close. 
The d-pad could be slightly better for example. But yeah.. surprisingly good ergonomics",SteamDeck
ji1dgov,"I could never really effectively play on controllers. 
I am at 40 hours in Dead space with the deck, second playthrough and it just feels good.",SteamDeck
ji1h50t,"I got baby hands...it hurts...a lot.

So much im looking forward for the gpd win 4, rpg ally or just an odin.",SteamDeck
ji1kolk,Oh absolutely! It feels great in my hands. I have a Switch and that thing kills my hands after playing it for an hour or two. Swapping over to the Deck makes a huge difference.,SteamDeck
ji1mksy,"had a funny experience yesterday. decoded to use an xbox controller to play sekiro on the tv. felt tiny and weird because i'm so used the the steam deck joysticks and dimensions and seemingly bigger(taller?) joysticks. 

i still think the xbox controller is very good, just supprised how quickly it felt foreign!",SteamDeck
ji1p1vp,"I just got my deck yesterday and I was surprised by how comfortable and light it felt given how big it is. I'm sure it would feel heavier if I had played for hours and hours, but I do think it's because of the ergonomics of it that it just feels perfect.",SteamDeck
ji1qnbs,Definitely the most confortable handheld I've ever tried.,SteamDeck
ji1rpdz,Valve must have a secret doctrine of ergonomics. The steam controller was also great but the steam deck has otherworldly ergonomics. I wish they would develop a new controller based on it,SteamDeck
ji1tpjw,"I agree. At first I thought it was a little too hefty, but after playing it for a while then going to the Switch, the Switch felt too light and too square. It feels just right for a handheld gaming machine",SteamDeck
ji1yh2t,"I really want to get a steam deck one day but I always expected to find it uncomfortable like the switch.


Hearing it's great for big hands is reassuring. I really didn't expect so many people online and irl to say how comfortable it feels. Just looking at it gives me the impression it would be unpleasant to old.


I can't wait to play on a deck at some point, even if it's very far away.",SteamDeck
ji229uf,"I'm on the opposite side. I can barely use it undocked because it's too big and too heavy. I'm a designer with chronicle pain in hands and wrists, so holding the deck isn't the best.

I do like its shape, it holds well, but the weight is too much for a play through :/

Edit: I am a small person, but my hands aren't that small for my size. I am a bass player also, my palm opening is wider than 20cm, but I lack the strength to hold the damn videogame.",SteamDeck
ji22b12,It's definitely good for a grown man hands,SteamDeck
ji25aug,"Everyone who sees the Deck in person thinks it's huge, and every time I tell them to FEEL it in their hands first. They always change their minds.

idk what kind of black magic Valve used on the ergonomics, but it FEELS like a system half its actual size when you're holding it. It's incredible.",SteamDeck
ji2b6pt,"The ergonomics of the Deck are great!   


The only thing I personally have a hard time with are the L1 and R1 buttons - I really have to pivot away from the intended holding position to reach those - not sure if this is just me",SteamDeck
ji2ben5,It's so hard using a switch after because it just feels cheap and flimsy.  My hands feel perfectly content with the deck.,SteamDeck
ji2xgnu,"Omg Yes 
The grips really make it so much more comfortable especially considering it’s weight. 
I always thought that it was kinda weird holding the flat surfaced Nintendo (3)DS and the Switch",SteamDeck
jhyph32,"I prefer the Deck over my Xbox controller by now, my hands feel almost smushed together when using the latter.
Though I have to say it's more slippery. I think the grips where your palms go could have used some type of texturing.",SteamDeck
jhyqkj8,Switching over from the aya neo. Absolutely it's game changing. Any handheld that's got subpar ergonomics will fail in comparison,SteamDeck
jhyscf1,"I jokingly told a friend that the Steamdeck is the first system that had playing on the toilet in mind when they created it.   


Ergonomically it's great as it is, but sit on the toilet, put your elbows on your knees, and hold the steamdeck in both hands. Somebody did a toilet play test with this machine. I almost guarantee it. lol",SteamDeck
jhyu3eu,"I love it. I have a switch, and, it's alright, I guess. But the Steam Deck? Fits much better, the heat from the fans is never felt, buttons are all accessible, it's really an amazing sweet spot size wise.",SteamDeck
jhyvkf5,"It is the perfect size! 

and if you want more, you could always go for covers to make it larger XD 

syntech's silicone cover made the deck even bigger",SteamDeck
jhywp0m,I was initially hesitant about the ergonomics of the SD but now feel it fits like a glove.,SteamDeck
jhyzu0y,"It's my favorite. If I have a choice of playing a game on my Switch vs Deck, it's always Deck just because of how much more comfortable it is in my hands.",SteamDeck
jhz0hkr,"Yeah, it's the only device other than an Xbox one controller I can hold for 6h without any fatigue.",SteamDeck
jhz12o2,"Same. At least for me, the size and weight has never been an issue because it still feels fantastic to hold.",SteamDeck
jhzofqn,"I honestly bought mine because of the screen size and I was REALLY glad and surprised about the ergonomics, specially the grips. 
I bought a Retroid Pocket 3+ for emulation and the screen is too small, and my hands hurt after 10min of gaming.

The Steam Deck is perfect for me. Even the weight is perfectly fine.

Edit: the only thing that IMO could be different is the dpad, I use it a lot on emulation and it's kinda stiffer than classic consoles, or Dual Shocks. But its pretty good.",SteamDeck
jhypifw,I can Mod Games on a Handheld thats the best feature,SteamDeck
ji0ph3k,"Every single review of the Steam Deck, including the negative ones, have from the beginning mentioned just how comfortable the device is to use.",SteamDeck
ji0gvvy,I absolutely hate the Xbox controller off side analogue sticks layout on anything so being playstation gamer 95 percent of the time  makes me love the steam deck even more,SteamDeck
ji0jtcl,"Probably. it does a lot right, ergonomics being one of them, but I wouldnt rate it as the best thing it does. the best thing it does is be an x86 gaming handheld at an affordable price.",SteamDeck
ji0rv6y,"As someone on the larger side of average myself, I really like the size of it, but I also definitely understand it being too big for some.",SteamDeck
ji0y5uh,"I like it but i think it could be better. Idk if I have weird hands or not but how am I to hold it exactly? Middle finger on rear trigger, index on bumpers? That seems most logical if I actually need to use the bumpers otherwise it’s not comfortable using my index for trigger and bumper.",SteamDeck
ji13d4t,"Every Reddit OP: ""Am I the only one...""

No. No you're not. There is 8 billion people out there.",SteamDeck
ji15ggl,It's okay but I prefer the Switch with the Hori split pad grips (which make it almost as wide as the Deck but with a much more normal controller style layout and the grips on the rear flaring out like an Xbox 360 pad). Everything being way up top to make room for the touchpads I don't really like to use isn't ideal for me.,SteamDeck
ji19epi,"A few months into having it I’m still not used to the button placement, I keep reaching for the touchpads every time I need to use the dpad or face buttons. I think because I regularly switch between using my Xbox and Deck I’m not getting the Decks layout in my head out of habit. Just something I gotta live with really, it’s not a dealbreaker but it is frustrating from time to time.",SteamDeck
ji1peqf,I personally feel the steam deck would benefit from a case that has kinda kiwi grip style holders for your hands to slot into. It's just so heavy and I've dropped it on my face in bed before. Not fun.,SteamDeck
ji1q2os,"Don't be silly.

The best thing about the deck is trackpads.

Every ""competitor"" that's releasing without them is not even a competitor in my eyes.",SteamDeck
ji28ifh,"It is surprisingly comfortable for how big it is. Literally the only complaints that I have about it are that I wish the screen was bigger, because that bezel is ginormous, and I wish it was easier to push L1 and R1. And I guess it's a tiny complaint I wish the bumper and Trigger labels were not upside down because that really is stressing me out for absolutely no reason",SteamDeck
ji2hzex,It grew on me. At first I thought the design was a bit big and goofy looking but now I appreciate the choices Valve made. Although options are always better so a more compact design for smaller hands would be welcome alongside the full size deck.,SteamDeck
ji3k7hz,"'am I the only one who thinks'

*Proceeds to state very popular opinion*",SteamDeck
jhz4bev,I don't even have large hands and the deck is still by far the most comfortable handheld I've ever held.,SteamDeck
jhzesvn,"Not a ""perfect fit"" for me, but the best by far I've ever used. I can't comfortably hold it and use the back buttons without an awkard motion",SteamDeck
ji0pwae,"Honestly, when I first got my switch, I had to get some type of case protector with pronounced grips as I feel I have to claw hold it, which crimps my hands out after a while. With the steam deck it feels a heck of a lot more comfortable to hold.",SteamDeck
ji1zjbk,How do you guys use the back plate buttons? I have large hands and actually seem to disagree with you guys. I think the ergonomics are very tiring after long hours and my longer fingers make hitting those extra buttons very awkward.,SteamDeck
ji0ymp3,I have smaller hands too and weirdly I found buying a silicone cover for the Deck helped me hold it better even though it made it marginally wider. Also thumbstick covers for the thumbstickers have been a godsend; my thumbs don't slide off them any more lol.,SteamDeck
ji13s9v,"I'm not small (5'8"") but I find it a little too bulky and heavy than would be ideal. I find a Switch with a ""pro"" controller attachment (I have the Hori Split Pad Pro) pretty optimal ergonomically. I still like the Deck a lot, but I find myself limiting how long I play sometimes. 

I do find it portable enough though. I don't walk around with it, but I think I wouldn't mind using it on a plane or train.",SteamDeck
ji1mbzi,"I'm 6' with medium hands and maybe it's because I'm picky with my controllers but I find the joysticks too far away to use with anything serious, like rocket league or a FPS game like apex (doesn't run well enough anyway, but still). I think they actually screwed up quite a bit with the size decisions. Maybe a large portion of their target demographic has larger hands, but I think that's a bit fucked up.

Also OP should invest in some better joycons or any of the many grips that make the switch beareable. I guess I'm in the center where NEITHER of the devices are ergonomic, without help. Unfortunately when you make a thing too big, there is not way to make it smaller, unlike switch where a 10 dollar grip could fix the issue.",SteamDeck
jhzcizn,"> small hands

This seems to be it, Switch is too small for me while Deck is the perfect size.",SteamDeck
ji2l9mb,"I have smallish hands but the SD isn’t that hard to hold for me. That said, though it does make the setup a bit more complex, for transportation time killing, Nreal Air glasses and a Bluetooth controller you find comfortable would really help I think. Then you can put the console down and just hold a controller, and your posture won’t be hunched over either. 

Of course this almost doubles the total volume of the thing in your bag, so it’s definitely not without compromise.",SteamDeck
jhzcfyg,"That's what I've noticed with the size difference of the Switch and Deck, Switch fits my GF's small hands perfectly, and my Deck fits my big hands perfectly.",SteamDeck
jhynh4m,"Spot on with these points.

I picked up my Nintendo Switch recently, and it felt like a toy. Not filling my hands, and having to have a claw with all that gap space in my grip did not feel good.

The button layout on Steam Deck are all reachable from the resting position of your grip; including trackpads *(exception to the steam overlay buttons)*.

I personally don’t like taking my trigger fingers off the L2/R2 to reach R1/R2 because of the grip position though… but guess what? Because of steam input I can configure them to L4/L5 instead back grips so I don’t have to.",SteamDeck
jhzcbto,"> 4 rear paddles (and yes, I use all four of them)

It's crazy to me that people don't! Same with the trackpads. That right there is 6 more buttons and 2 mouse inputs, I havn't found a single game that makes the Deck lack with inputs, but I absolutely had that issue tons of times on controllers.

> off set analogs.

Absolutely hate this, every single handheld has this too and I've never understood how asymmetry could help ergonomics, our right and left hands are the same hands, why should they have to sit differently?",SteamDeck
jhz4fsd,I have small hands. The deck is still more comfortable then all the other handhelds you mentioned. I *loved* my Vita but my hands would definitely cramp holding that thing.,SteamDeck
jhyjcdm,"Glad you brought this up because I keep hearing this about using a handheld on a desk, especially in reviews for the Ally. But for me if I’m at my desk I’m on my PC. I got the deck for literally everywhere else and to allow me to get away from my desk. IMO the biggest use case for handhelds is the couch, your bed, or traveling, not on a desk.",SteamDeck
jhzur81,"I did try the hori both pro and compact, some grip thing, and a skull and co case. The skull case felt the most comfortable but unfortunately nothing came even close to the stock deck for me.",SteamDeck
ji25gow,i ended up getting stick-on handle grips from Playvital instead of a full case - added just enough of a textured surface to make my grip more secure,SteamDeck
jhzcgyg,By far the best controller I've ever used.,SteamDeck

ji0avbm,There are 3rd party replacements for the back buttons that stick out more. I'm getting about getting some and trying them out.,SteamDeck
ji1jec8,"Do you have your index and middle fingers on the bumpers and triggers, with your ring and pinky on the back buttons?

If so that grip never worked for me either. I gave up on the bumpers and use my index fingers on the triggers. My middle and ring are on the back buttons. I just remap L1/R1 to back buttons and it's comfortable to hold and use.",SteamDeck
ji2r1sf,Till this day I haven't gotten a case with grips for my switch. I might get one to play to because the hand fatigue is insane with the joycons,SteamDeck
ji2rdeo,I personally use them very little unless I'm playing a shooter. Try getting the jsaux backplate replacement! It comes with extra back triggers in different sizes and heights,SteamDeck
ji2wxz5,"I map L4 and R4 to L1 and R1 and use with middle fingers so I don't have to reach up with my index. Then map L5 and R5 to whichever A,B,X,Y I need to use without moving my right thumb off the controller. 

In Halo for instance, I can use gernades, melee, jump, and equipment while turning simultaneously.",SteamDeck
ji1bom6,"It's a grip thing, definitely. Also makes my hands less sweaty because of the silicon and the ridges where your palms rest. More airflow/ventilation if that makes sense.",SteamDeck
ji2y662,"I didn't think of that, maybe I'll consider a silicone cover, but I don't really like how they look and they tend to gather dust/dirt easily. Also I've already bought a skin that I've been procrastinating putting on, lol. I was considering buying thumb grips though, did you get ones made for the Switch or for PS/Xbox controllers?",SteamDeck
ji2yqom,">Unfortunately when you make a thing too big, there is not way to make it smaller, unlike switch where a 10 dollar grip could fix the issue.

Yeah exactly. I even saw that someone on here made a mod to make the Steam Deck even bigger, lol.",SteamDeck
jhyqao3,"I'm at a friend's place and her little sister has a switch (never had one in my hands before) god it feels miniscule in my big ass hands, I have my eyes in the ROG but I fear it might feel too small for large handed people like me. (The back triggers are really helpful too)",SteamDeck
ji08xbw,"I've been playing on my Steam Deck ever since I got it four months ago, and picking up my Switch to update my games gave me such whiplash because it was just so... light!

It's definitely easier to carry around and chuck into bags, but I much prefer the library of the Deck. Plus, I can't imagine comfortably playing shooters for a long time on the Switch. Deck is built for that.",SteamDeck
jhzdbr4,Bless you.,SteamDeck
ji0hrg2,Same,SteamDeck
ji2gagp,"Yea I only keep index fingers on the shoulder buttons, typically. I guess my fingers are long enough that to press the back buttons, my middle and ring fingers have to squeeze and arch a bit, so I have to briefly readjust how I support the device overall. If that describes it.  

But that is a pretty neat idea, forgoing the shoulder buttons altogether. Ill try that grip out.",SteamDeck
ji2soyu,Yeah the joy con controllers was not pleasant and I switched out for the pro controller when playing on a TV,SteamDeck
jhyrpoi,"Also an interesting aspect, is that when a device is too light, it actually takes more effort to *”hold up”* at a viewing distance/angle. The weight of the steam deck provides a good counterbalance so that it doesn’t feel weird. Maybe that’s placebo idk.",SteamDeck

ji3bbau,"Idk I have a switch lite and it’s so much easier to hold up than my steam deck. The deck is so heavy that I have to rest it on something if I’m playing it. Ergonomically I think the deck beats the switch for button placement, but it is so heavy!",SteamDeck

jhxsvj5,"I think we are seeing 3 things happen.

1.	We are starting to move on from last gen.  Which means a huge jump in cpu power and vram requirements.  We have been spoiled by the last gen consoles holding back cpu use.  Pretty much anything newer than a 6th gen Intel didn’t have much of a problem.  Now that consoles leaped in cpu power, we won’t see low cpu requirements anymore.


To explain the cpu side more, the increase likely comes from a few things.  Wildly more draw calls because geometric density increases.  Streaming in assets uses a lot of cpu.  And also introduces a lot of other new issues.  And RT adds a heavy cpu toll due to the bvh structure.

Funny enough UE5 should fix a lot of the cpu issues as it introduces direct storage support, new world partition streaming, nanite, and better multi threaded support. 

2.	People are pushing UE harder and don’t know how to optimize it well.  UE is super powerful and can do great things, but it really requires a large and talented team to optimize it well.  There are only a handful of studios that have shown competence in this so far.  A great example of this is looking at borderlands 3 from launch to now and then tiny Tina which when pretty solid technically if a little underwhelming.  It took them like 5 years to figure out ue4.  After the game came out…

3.	Devs have less time to polish and games are rushed out way earlier than they should be.  WAY EARLIER

I think time will fix #2 a bit as more of the industry moves to UE but it could likely get worse for a while as everyone tries to wrangle ue5…",SteamDeck

There is also just an awkward reality in which a crappy RTX 2000 series, followed by a crypto boom destroyed 3000 series, and a crazy expensive 4000 means a lot of PC gamers that might have done a new build in the last 5 years or so haven't, so the random ""gaming"" PC is probably a tad older and less powerful vs a nice new box then is historically normal.",SteamDeck

There is a general lack of knowledge when it comes to optimization in game development. And a big chunk of this comes from universities (and similar programs) not putting any emphasis on it.

We have a university in my city that has a game dev program, but unfortunately it seems they do little more than teaching students how to throw assets into a Unity/Unreal engine.",SteamDeck

Upper management, executives, and shareholders set these dates and deadlines, based on their financials for the year. When games weren’t generating as much money as a whole, there were less hands in the kitchen. 

Now that these games are the highest selling entertainment products, corners get cut to meet deadlines.

I dont get the logic, why not take a bit longer, what was the dire rush?

I would point out that spec wise we have been lagging for about two years, mostly down to cpu/gpu shortages/components due to covid. It would appear the tech lag has caught up with us at last. I am actually surprised that people are reacting this way. I mean we all knew it would catch up hardware wise eventually.

Making a decision to release a port this way sounds like very bad management decisions. I mean who actually owns these rigs, why design a game that cant run on say 50% of specced machines?",SteamDeck

I don't notice the difference between 30fps and 60fps usually on these games. I just get used to it and play.

I actually love bad games, they're my favourite. I finished Ride to Hell: Retribution, put in 130 hours on BF2042, and loved playing through Duck Dynasty streaming to mates. it's sort of amusing when I ask friends to play some games cause quite a few games I like playing through are just bad, but I guess I find their badness more interesting than many above-average but bland games.

jhws4yg,"So i've been playing BOTW on my steam deck for about two weeks now, just finished off ruta and going on to the second divine beast with about 2 dozen shrines completed.  I installed with emudeck.  For anyone wondering why yuzu over cemu, I own an original switch and can dump my own roms.  Never had a WII U and have no interest in picking one up at this point.  


YUZU runs great.  The beginning was a little rough with the shader compilation but after a few minutes it was barely noticeable.  Occasionally when I encounter something new I get a frame drop for a few seconds while shader compile but 95% of the time it's not a problem.  Even with turning down the TDP, etc I still get a locked 30 FPS. 

For a while I used steam input to map the gyro to the right stick.  It worked well but I couldn't control some of the shrines.  Emudeck has the GyroDSU option that works great (be sure to reboot).

Biggest issue is that after a ""long sleep"" the Steam deck wakes up and applies the default Mouse/Keyboard bindings until I open and close the steam menu. Additional issues came when I tried to install the second wind mod.  After working through the windows install instructions on linux yuzu would just segfault.  Turns out yuzu was running into a max open file limit.  After fixing that it booted, but yuzu crashed when I got near enemies.  Oh well.",SteamDeck

And then, even if it is rough, i at least know i'll get the intended experience. With yuzu it might offer a stable 30fps, but it might also introduce new inaccuracies that mess up some things!

I already have all the games for free, and I had them for free before I ever got a Deck. In terms of being predatory, Valve sells powerful mobile hardware at a loss, developed Proton and SteamOS which they distribute for free, is a far superior environment for purchasing games, and does really basic shit like let their device have a web browser.

Yuzu already performs well on a PC and I’ve been able to run BoTW at 4k since 2020 if I remember correctly. And the last time I checked I was able to get to 60fps with some tinkering (cant remember if it was the 60fps mod, or switching from Vulkan to opengl or vice versa).

Switch hardware is 7 year old at this point and most modern games are going to run BETTER on yuzu islf you have the hardware to support it. Xenonlade 3 for example runs at 60fps on a PC with Yuzu vs 30 something fps on a switch.

Now these are facts, so I’d like to hear some counter arguments with facts if possible. Just saying “official hardware is gonna do it better” is not gonna cut it. Especially, since the official hardware is 7 years old.

Now, go ahead and tell me who is “tech illiterate“ again.

I haven't had anything like that. I still have some memories of using Windows 98, so I have some familiarity. The OS seems fine to me for the most part, though I never used the 64 GB chip that came with my Steam Deck at all for comparison. I swapped it out with the SYONCON before turning it on.

I haven't benchmarked it or anything, but still no speed issues. I don't think I've transferred anything directly to it from another drive. Pretty much everything on the SSD was downloaded from online. I have 1000Mb/s internet which is around 125MB/s, so that's about the highest I could download anyway. Wifi is closer to 600Mb/s on my network which is 75MB/s, so your referenced 80MB/s would be faster than any download transfer speed I'd be able to maintain anyway.

No issues with slowdowns in games at all or slow loading times.

Without benchmarking, I'm not sure what to say. Maybe yours is a lemon? I can't tell you anything for sure without having benchmarked mine. There are people who have benchmarked and posted screenshots in their Amazon reviews which is what assured me to get it in the first place.

I never had to use the clock speed limit and wattage thing in the quick menu for other games but I had to manually limit the decks hardware just so Spiderman didn't crash by using up every possible inch of the deck to run on low graphics at 20fps. And yet, most articles I saw said that it was one of the best games for deck? I'm telling you now, it wasn't. I have NEVER had that much difficulty trying to play and keep a game stable. The performance was even worse when upscaling to 1920/1080 in docked mode, so you had to play 1280/720 on a big TV screen... It was a balancing act between the game looking good but running slow, or running fast but looking like ass.

Yet, miles morales was much better. It looked amazing, ran at a good 45+fps, and I didn't need to tweak any settings.

ji3becj,"If Decky Recorder is giving you fits, try this. Never record anything in MP4 format. It's unreliable, it sucks and I wish I never used it. Caused a lot of aggravation. Use Matroska (mkv) instead. Far more reliable. [Ruiner on Steam Deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijh9Jzr5ZSQ) (on sale for $4 right now on Steam). Recorded using Decky Recorder/mkv format. 

I've had too many problems with OBS on Windows. Never liked it as a result and avoid it whenever possible. Screen Recorder 4 by Cyberlink works much better for me on Windows if I'm not using the Windows 11 screen capture. But the best alternative when it's all said and done is a capture card. The Steam Deck can be connected to a capture card with USB C to HDMI adapter and then connect the capture card to a PC using a USB 3 port. The screen on the Steam Deck will go black but that's a good thing. It means the A/V signal is being pushed to the PC. If you open up OBS, Screen Recorder 4 or any software that will accept that feed then the Steam Deck's video output will show up on the PC screen.

The Steam Deck is still active even though the screen is off so you could still use the controls on the Deck but you'd have to watch the computer screen. Technically you could record this way but there is an increase in latency. Ideally you'd want to have the connected PC to record your footage via the capture card, but go HDMI out of the capture card into a separate monitor so there's no increase in latency when you're playing games while looking at the monitor.

Personally, I didn't want to have to rig up that arrangement due to space concerns so I went direct into a Surface Studio and used the 28 inch screen. It works but to be honest, Decky Recorder using mkv format is far more convenient.",SteamDeck

jhw5u1n,"I know jack shit about computers, but with the tutorial the page has, just followed it and was really easy to install emudeck and the roms and bios. Of course for some things I had to look further, like modding, but there are resources to learn how to do it",SteamDeck

jhw61jv,"This is not an excuse but as an FYI...

Parse (verb) and parser (noun - something that parses) are such common terms in programming that we (programmers) tend to forget that it might not be so common for most people.

When a compiler reads source code, it parses the source code. When you load an XML file you do via an XML parser. Same with YAML or JSON or INI files etc. 

When you as a human read a sentence, and make sense of subject, objects, verbs, nouns and pronouns, relate which pronouns relates to  which, see where there are subordinate clauses etc, the mental process that you're doing is called parsing.

A parser typically turns a linear stream of ""tokens"" (eg sequence of words and punctuation as defined by the rules of that language about what makes a ""token"") into a tree of symbols structured according to the rules of the language.

A simple parser may take ""1+ 2 \* -3"" and typically first a stage of parsing (or a ""lexer"") will break that into the tokens `1` and `+` and `2` and `\*` and `-3` and then the parse will build that into a tree where the structure shows that the multiplication is done before the addition.

So any operation that ""*reads some sort of mostly flat config, makes sense of it all, resolves references etc and determines the correct structure*"" tends to be called, in techie terms, parsing...",SteamDeck
jhw2fod,"that step is just for adding the emulators and roms to your steam library. whatever emulators you have installed and roms you have downloaded in their correct folder will show up in this list. parsing, if I recall correctly, is just the computer identifying which parts are related to each other. so in emudecks case, it would be relating each rom to its correct emulator so that when you launch it from steam, it runs in the emulator that it's meant for. I'm not sure what wasn't working for you, but ensure that the emulators you want to use are installed and that your roms and bios (if needed) are in the correct location. then load up roms manager, go to preview, make sure the window is full screened so that you can see everything and if it all looks good then click ""save"" and everything should be in your steam library under ""collections"", all organized in folders",SteamDeck
jhw3wmi,"Yeah using the term ""parser"" so heavily in that workflow is kind of shortsighted, hopefully they rephrase it at some point. A few lines of explanation would make clear that the first step is to select categories of games and emulators to find, and then it will produce a list of candidates to add to your library. The word parser isn't needed (even if that's what's going on in the back end).",SteamDeck

I've got those six years old Bose SoundLink on ear and they work pretty nice.

Microphone is decent, they fold, have a carrying case, can be wired. Battery lasts still few hours.

If you find some used, for a dozen bucks you should get fresh earpads (the fake leather shreds in a couple years of daily use - the original pads are like 40 bucks, but knockoffs are fine.

It's better to focus on the positives and be grateful for what you do have. I think that's the best way to get out of a funk. I'm lucky to have amazing parents and be born in the United States; I mean, what more can I ask for? I am incredibly blessed, and focusing on the blessings and grace you've been given and helping others that are less fortunate is the best medicine for tragedy. 

I had the opportunity to go on a humanitarian trip to help out the Hatianos in the bateyes in the Dominican Republic. Say what you will about the efficiency of humanitarian work (it's not, lol), but being there and seeing people in much worse shape than I have ever been, but still smiling and being grateful despite their condition really changed how I look at suffering.

ji1xs8e,"You got that right!

In this case, your best scenario would be having an nvme enclosure to slap the SteamDeck internal storage after removing it, a machine with Linux (windows *will not* read it since it's not formatted in a format that can understand) or a thumbstick to fire up a Linux distribution live.

You could also seek the help of another deck owner.

Consider this: when trying to carve such small files,  either they will come up immediately, or you might want to try a deeper scan.

A deeper scan will carve out any kind of data it might find, but filenames will be *absolute random garbage*.

You will need to sift trough that (you might end up piling up few thousands of files) trying to identify them with fingerprinting or by size (another whole different problem to solve).

If a quick scan immediately gives back what you lost you're golden, if you start to carve for any chunk of erased data, you might end up having to work *many hours hoping* that stuff is still there.

I ordered the sn720 already and will make the swap when it arrives, but usually it takes 2-3 weeks for that.

And the reality, is that the worst possible kind of load that the SD can push, is high reads to load games, which usually don't take long. Or when installing games high writes. However considering a 1Gbps ISPs, you'll still only need 100MB writes for about 30 min (if you consider a 250GB game which is the worst case scenario today), which is still way lower than the usual 2000GB writes that most nvme ssds offer and would hardly make it hot since it's 1/20 of its max sequential write speeds.",SteamDeck

Privileges can only be enforced within a system as a means of policing itself. A separate system that has write access to the root partition of the first (such as the installation ISO has over the on-device drive) doesn't need to respect anything.

Edit:

Wait, you're talking about Core options. For that, you have to go into ""Manage Core options"" under ""Options"" in Quick Menu and save it with ""Save Game option"".

It's a bit confusing at first. Retroarch has basically 3 different places where you can save specific things, that would be Shaders, Core options and the rest, as global, core, directory or game option.

Have a look at this:

ji2h62z,"Yep, exactly. Good job! Out of curiosity:

Why aren't you using ParaLLEl in general for N64? It's much better in terms of accuracy.",SteamDeck
ji2i88t,"So every time I use it, everything gets more pixelated and overall worse looking and it introduces a lot of graphical glitches and framerate performance issues for ""intensive"" parts of the game (by N64 standards lol). Maybe it's just a default settings issue? GLiden64 doesn't have any of that.",SteamDeck
ji2lc46,"May I ask to which game you are referring?

I already played some of the most demanding games for N64 like Perfect Dark, Conker's Bad Fur Day etc. They are indeed running fine. The point about ParaLLel is accuracy. So games run, more or less, 1:1 like they would on a real N64 regarding graphics and performance. So, slowdowns as much like perhaps some blurryness are a part of the experience because it's happening on real N64 hardware too. Though, graphical glitches should not be present. For instance, Perfect Dark runs with 10-20 frames, depending on the scene, on real N64. When it comes to Emulation, specifically N64, I like to have an original experience as much as possible. At least that is my view. :)

In general, the trick to get ParaLLel running good (on Steam Deck) is, to turn off SMT via PowerTools. You can further play with the tdp and/or mhz limits. I wrote down a small guide regarding this stuff some time ago. There it is:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wj7yvm/comment/ijhda0w/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wj7yvm/comment/ijhda0w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Feel free to play around with ParaLLel. But in general, because of its nature, GLiden64 is not as demanding as ParaLLel, so you get a better performance overall, if a system is not capable of running with ParaLLel. Luckily, Steam Deck is. On the other hand, GLiden64 is lacking accuracy. See those screenshots for example:

ji2lx85,"The Super Mario 64 images you sent are a good example of what I was experiencing. A lot more pixilated, but you're saying that's more ""true"" to the original game? I could see the value in that. I'll mess around with the settings more to try and get it working better",SteamDeck
ji2ohpt,"Yeah, it's the more accurate experience, so to say. But it's fine if people don't like that. We have choice and that's good.

But, to combat that low resolution, pixelated look, ParaLLel offers some nice upscaling in the Core options menu. So, in practice, you can render a game in a higher resolution than N64 was capable of and still have this accurate look. I do only recommend setting it to 2x, though. Not more, or your Steam Deck will suffer, haha. And in some demanding games, like Perfect Dark, I experienced some issues in form of glitches and bad performance in special situations, like using the spy eye.

Here is an article about the upscaling function:

One issue even if we could get LAN to work is that relatively few games support it.

I was able to eventually get two Steam Decks onto the same adhoc LAN network but couldn't get them to connect on Stardew Valley.

1) Start a mobile hot-spot on your phone

2) Connect the steam deck that will be hosting the session

3) In your phone hot-spot settings find the connected steam deck and click on it. This should show you the IP address on an android. If you're on iPhone, just dig around, shouldn't be hard to find.

4) Connect the second steam deck to the same hotspot

5) On the host deck, start the game > Host > Start new farm or an existing one. Once the game's started it will say you're now hosting a multiplayer session

6) Go to the game settings and check that you're accepting IP connections. I think you also need to be friends on steam for ""friends-only"" co op but not sure about that one.

7) On the other deck, start the game > co op > join LAN game

&#x200B;

>It’s a little more discreet overall, and it does that without sacrificing any power.

He says this, but just a few lines above, also says this about the switch flick that makes it quieter:

>Even better is that I was able to quickly toggle on a silent setting with a quick menu tap, cutting virtually any excess noise (though it caused Forza Horizon 4’s frame rate to plummet from 60 to 30 instantly, as you might expect).

So you **are** sacrificing power to run it quiet. What about when it is running at full power? Well, you can look in my dubious claims section for that.

&#x200B;

Then he writes about customization as a strong point, as if the Steam Deck didn't have the same features if not more.

>The level of customization here is another area that has me high on the system at first glance. \[...\]   
>  
>Pressing a dedicated button on the device brings up a fast pop-out menu that lets users manage their performance settings and more with some quick taps. Midgame, I could easily pop it open and adjust my frame rate cap, resolution, refresh rate, and other settings with some fast taps. 

All features that the Steam Deck has. Next.

>Every button on the Ally can be remapped to controller, mouse, keyboard, and numpad functions

And he keeps talking about that. He even goes into ""complex keyboard commands"", rehashing in words **everything the Steam Input System can already do** as if ROG Ally's offering is new.

&#x200B;

>Valve’s 60Hz 1200 x 800 screen

Again, lie. It's 1280 x 800. If you specify 1920x1080 for the ROG Ally, at least get the resolution correct for the Deck.

&#x200B;

>I was on track for the battery to run out within an hour. \[...\] a lot of high-end games tap out around there on Steam Deck

Again, lies. Correct me if I am wrong, but I have never seen a healthy battery on a steam deck, at 100%, last under 1h50. At least.

&#x200B;

And he also makes some dubious claims.

&#x200B;

>While it was hard to fully hear the difference in a bustling showroom, the Ally seems to be a quieter system overall.

I don't know about you, but testing noise level in a showroom is bound to bring you crappy results in comparing noise level.

&#x200B;

>a happy middle ground between a Steam Deck and a Nintendo Switch. It’s more comfortable than either as well

Which is all well and good and an opinion, no problem with that. But take this quote, from the same reviewer, about his Steam Deck One Year later article:

>If I have the option between playing on my Switch OLED or Steam Deck, I’ll always go with the former. \[...\] What I lose in power and customization, I gain back in comfort and reliability.

Which makes you **really** question his opinion on comfort. It is no secret that the Switch is one of the most uncomfortable handheld device. It definitely is not a strong point of it.

You practically need replacement grips. So I question his opinion on that. Brings doubt over the validity of his review.

The author explains that their frame rate is cut in half using the ""silent mode"", then in the next paragraph, says it doesn't sacrifice any power to be quieter... Is this satire?

My take is this... Asus knows they cant compete with the SD on price because of how much more expensive the Ally is, if this wasnt the case, they would have opened with ""for only $100 or $200 you get 2 times the performance of the SD and all these extra features""

Asus is trying to showcase their feature strengths first and build up hype so people can see the extra value so when they finally announce the (high) price of the Ally people feel that it offers more value --> this tactic is marketing BS 101

my guess $799 is the minimum price they will charge for it, my bet is $899; the problem is that at that price it is ""entry level gaming laptop"" range.

Zero chance. Valve is all in on the deck, it's just another product for whoever makes a ""competitor"". That means, at best, a lotta updates for a little while, maybe 6-12 months. Then it'll get a handful of updates after that before being abandoned, and eventually Microsoft will push a Windows update that destroys it in some way.

The deck will live probably over a decade after valve finally stops supporting it (because steam deck 4 is out and they just don't want to keep updating something that can't run Call of Modern Black Warfare Ops 9, or Forza Horizon 21, much less GTA 7).

The Ally? It'll be abandoned in a year when they make the Ally 2 if not the entire idea being that it's abandoned entirely.

""What catches my eye the most is its control customization potential. Every button on the Ally can be remapped to controller, mouse, keyboard, and numpad functions — and those can be mixed and matched together. Each button can be mapped with a secondary command too, allowing me to turn my right trigger into a shift key if I press it while holding down a back button. ""

All the other handhelds can have any flavor of Linux installed including ones like ChimeraOS. Don't see laptop owners talking down hard on NUCs for being a worse deal. Desktop gamers mildly talk about price to performance disparity between laptop and desktop. People still buy NUCs rather than docking a laptop or buying a microATX/miniITX computer. I'm subbed to the Xbox, Playstion, PC Gaming, Linux centric subs, Android/mobile gaming, emulation, subs and this one is by far the most victim complex and circlejerky one.

I don't even have any of these non-Deck window devices but I still contribute to the ChimeraOS patreon because I'd like to see the whole handheld PC market segment expand with good Linux support. Valve comes out and says they hope that the Steam Deck popularizes the form factor for other PC vendors and people in here acting like there's some war going on. It's the same ecosystem. Ayaneo is working on their own Linux distro and their Next II is supposed to have touchpads but the placement looks less comfortable. GPD Win you get a whole keyboard in various form factors.

jht2qz7,"Tit for tat tbh...

No doubt it'll sell and well too, but what it is isn't standing up consistently to where gaming is going any more than the Deck does and will imo.

For both, battery life is a huge concern. Doubting that Asus have either come up with a new battery tech or even leveraged a current experimental one, this'll be a thing (get your powerbanks charged, folks)  The specs that do the biz are somewhat better than the Deck (so back to the battery point) but are also at face asked to do more... 1080p which is nice but not absolutely necessary on such a screen size. I mean, I have a QHD res phone, the last was a HD res, both 6 inches or so and damned if I could tell a difference 99% of the time... (and thus for the Deck's 720-800p, at that size it's at least as good as a laptop screen at 1080p) and at 120Hz... even then good luck getting the most out of that. One of the current hot debates in gaming rn is re 8Gb and 1440p... well, it hasn't always been enough consistently at 1080p either so a bit better than a Deck is still going to come with caveats. Of which I'm happy with what the Deck can do. Sure, maybe medium settings and 30 fps is trash but away from my desk (desktop) or bed or couch (laptop) what other options are there that don't come with certain and mostly similar conditions? Oh, also no touch pads... I'll admit not a thing I've used much on Deck but certainly will be useful over time as non 1st/3rd person and/or controller optimised games are a big part of my play (though I must admit I like the RGB rings on the sticks)

I actually took a little browse re this, as I haven't been bothered so far. At least one article pointed out that the Deck doesn't play well with XBGP, EGS aso... which isn't exactly true, so I don't know what's going on there. Sure, setting the Deck up to do more than ootb takes some research and knowledge but it's nothing one can't do with a few years of accumulated PC gaming know how already under their belt... or a couple of hours to google etc. So yeah, the Ally will be better ootb/for casuals and a bit more speccy overall but it's not a huge deal better nm the possible pricing/availability/scalping it's sure to have as cons.

jht8wih,"No doubts it's going to be a decent system. But I'd be very surprised if the Ally is anywhere close to price competitive with the Deck. It's a thoroughly enthusiast device from everything I've seen, while the Deck is more Valve's attempt to appeal to console gamers. Asus also lacks an ecoystem to subsidize the hardware. Not to mention that precompiled shaders are a highly underrated secret sauce for the Deck, which the Ally probably won't have. So expect lots of stutters with UE games. 

That said, more competition in this space is always welcome. While I probably spend the majority of my gaming time with the Deck nowadays, I still kind of see it as a supplementary system to my desktop. If I'm going to play Cyberpunk or (especially) FS2020, I'm going to have a much better time on there. But with how rapidly AMD's mobile APUs are advancing, I could see devices like the Ally becoming a full desktop replacement.",SteamDeck

Yes it will be a better performer but performance is hardly everything and the Deck is no slouch anyway. The high end performance level that grabbed everyone's attention sounds like it will only be on the top end unit which is unlikely to be priced in Steam Deck territory.

Then there are the many Deck features - both hardware and software - that are better on Deck or that don't exist at all on the Ally. Trackpads, more back buttons, gyro, Steam OS, Proton, Steam Input, Valve providing precompiled shaders caches, etc.

Then there's the amazing community from this subreddit to accessory manufacturers to the emulation scene to the official parts store and much more beyond.

Then there's Valve and their commitment to the Steam Deck for the long haul. They will be providing replacement parts and updating the original Deck's software long after the original Ally is discontinued.

I'm not dissing the ROG Ally. I believe it will sell great and I'm glad to see it (and so is Valve). But it's hardly ""Over"" for the Steam Deck which will continue to be well loved long after the original Ally's product lifecycle has come and gone.

So, assuming that's the case, they possibly got early access to the ROG Ally through a sponsorship/partner programme/press event.

It sounds very 'advertisement-disguised-as-opinion'.

At the end of the day, the Ally will perform better cause the hardware is newer by more than a generation, depending on which deck you have.

Depending on what Valve and their R&D department decide to do with the Steam Deck, it's already very modular and extremely DIY friendly, so they could absolutely release hardware upgrade kits to improve performance.

Steam OS is just as beneficial for the Steam Deck as its comparatively low price.

Too much of a coincidence. I wouldn't put it past amd holding out on offering that chip instead of the one they sold to valve to sell to Asus instead. 

We will have to see when they do that reveal next month. It only has Xbox handheld division speaking there, Asus division speaking and a amd handheld rep. 

Smells like this was privately in the works since valve revealed their steam deck as a possible counter to Linux taking up anymore space in the handheld market vs Microsoft. Ms doesn't want them to get any traction on it for sure. 

But one thing is certain: this device will be between 800 and up to twice as much as the top of the line steam deck offering. So not worth it. Don't care if they pack it in every Walmart and best buy for sale from coast to coast. 

The price point is what makes the SD appealing. Pricing shit at laptop prices puts it out of the hands of parents thinking of stuff for their kids or family members buying gifts. Turns it into a niche product instead. 

Plus you got windows on every one. That costs licensing fees. I'm sure Asus isn't eating the cost, and that free 3mo game pass is somewhere in that cost too. As well as the Asus brand tax they put on everything they sell since they have been selling electronics. Always a premium with their shit. 

So I'm not sweating it fr. It's going to do maybe paltry sales. And even less for the egpu addon. That thing is a joke too.. come on, 1800-2000 for one with a 4090 in it, get real. It's like 1200-1500 for the 3080 model.

jhui0ly,"It's not even a competitor at that predicted 
 price point.",SteamDeck
jhui2m3,"It's lighter than the SD, which is ironically a major concern. Everything else aside, there's no way the battery life is good.

The SD has a 5200mAh battery, assuming this is lithium-ion that's pushing 200g *just for the battery*. Considering they've managed to shave off 60g compared to the SD (bringing it down to 608g), there's no way they've chosen to cram a bigger battery into it, so I'll be reasonably optimistic and say it's also 5200mAh. I'm also basing this on the fact asus themselves claim ""comparable"" battery life when both are running at 15W.

They now have to run a more powerful APU (not sure how much by but it supposedly boosts to 30W), running games at a higher frame-rate (up to 4x) and resolution (around 2x pixels), into a brighter screen (x1.25). With the SD the APU doesn't go past 15W and you can reasonably assume another 15W for everything else (hence absolute worst-case results of just under 90 minutes, 40Wh/30W=1.333=80min). From just the APU alone, you could have 50% more power draw from it boosting, which pushes playtime under an hour.

Remember how SD got slated for poor battery life despite 2h being perfectly usable in a lot of cases and being able to push it over 8h in indies? If the non-APU draw on this is worse than the SD you could hit *half an hour* of battery life, and squeezing every last minute out of the battery goes against what this device is supposed to be. After all, if you wanted long battery life, why not get an SD and external battery pack?

I'm guessing the price is going to be $850 as well. It's ""under $1000"", but surely they would state it's close to $500 if that were the case in order to build hype. This isn't competing with SD at all, it's trying to eat the market other companies built up for high-end handhelds.

Finally, here's the telling thing about all of this: There's a decent amount of info about this floating around like the processor type and how much memory it has. Price and battery? Nothing, all speculative. I don't remember if price was known before-hand, but I'm almost positive full specs were available for the SD before pre-orders were open.",SteamDeck
jhui4jx,"The Ally just shows me what Valve can source now, too. The VRR screen is the real selling point here. Doubling the TDP to get less than double the performance is a bad trade, which is why Valve didn't target it and shouldn't target it. Imagine having less than hour battery life and thinking that's great.

But that VRR screen is something I hope the Steam Deck's successor gets next year along with a Zen4-based chip with mostly the same TDP as the original. Let the idiots cook their systems with high TDP's. I'll take 15 or less please.",SteamDeck
jhuin5t,"I think this has an audience, but it’s not going to take users away from Steam Deck. They’re two entirely different products, other than being handhelds. SD is definitely for enthusiasts and ROGA is for someone that just wants to pickup a handheld and play GamePass. 

Personally this has limited appeal to me. However it runs GP native and there are some PC GP games I don’t have access to on my XSS. Yes the Deck can do that, but it’s more tedious. It doesn’t bother me, but some people aren’t interested. So in that way this makes sense. I bet that OLED looks fire.",SteamDeck

jhujixs,"If it's under 900, it's a hard-contender for the steam deck.

After tax for the 512gb SD it comes to ~$694.30 USD shipped.

If the ally is a $200 premium for 100% increase in power - let alone the physical upgrades with 120hz full HD+ monitor, better  brightness, and a battery that would keep it on-par with the steam deck's battery life with those higher specs? That's an easy sell, for anyone.

Is it a steam deck ""killer?"" No. Different handheld, different markets. But if the margins end up being that slim between the two devices, this could easily eclipse the SD.

Either way, if it does or doesn't, it's a good thing. Look at it this way: the fact that the ROG Ally exists means Valve accomplished exactly what it set out to do, which was create an industry standard. The SD is the only device in it's bracket with its featureset to be a full-fledged mobile *PC* gaming device. 

+ More devices = bigger ecosystem

- Bigger ecosystem = more choices

* More choices = best outcome for *consumers*

For me, the biggest drawback of the Asus ROG Ally is Windows 11. The system doesn’t seem to have the alignment between software and hardware that the deck does. Asus should invest in their optimization and UI because that is where the deck excels as a portable machine. I’ve also heard misgivings about the Ally’s ergonomics.

I want the new Ally, but it feels like a sidegrade.

-	Id love a smaller footprint but not at the expense of two back buttons.

-	Id love a more ergonomic layout for small hands but not at the expense of trackpads. 

-	Id love a USB4/TB port, but not locked to Asus shitty $2000 dock.

-	After customising buttons with macros, radial menus, sub layers, and everything that Valve has spent years building from their valve controller… I can’t see anyone catching up soon when Asus can’t even get armoury crate to work half the time.

One has an operating system that was designed for a handheld. The other is using an OS that was never designed for a handheld but a desktop pc. One is COMPLETELY open source (hardware and software), the other is not. One is controlled by a wise old wizard of a gamer (Gaben), who understand what all of us want in a handheld as the man is a gamer himself. The other is tied to cheap pc's that are great for your grandparents to surf the internets and can be purchased at any Walmart, but gaming is not the primary focus, and most likely never will be. One has incredible control with every base being covered so any game is very playable (even without a mouse and keyboard). the other has plain old joystick controls that will work on some games, and others is going to be severely limited. Lastly, one looks like it was designed by a gamer and is sexy as fuck, the other looks like something a teenage girl would love and is blindly ugly. The only plus is its more powerful, but heat, battery life and cost are the downsides here.  Asus should of paid more attention to what gamers want, instead of going for power. Yes faster frame rates are nice, but if I want faster framerates I'll fire my main pc. The funny thing is my pc has a 3070 and a I9 and I spend WAAAAY more time with my Deck.

Honestly though, all I think about is how great in 3-4 years (or whenever it'll be) the next iteration of the Steam Deck will be. For whatever reason, fanboy or not, I don't trust that particular handheld will live for that long. Or at the very least have support on the same level that the Steam Deck has.

Majority of these articles are just sponsored content paid by Asus to hype their gaming device. They are spending so much on marketing this thing that I'm fully expecting it to be a pump and dump flop. The main comparison is the hardware vs the steam deck, which isn't what gives the steam deck its advantage over competitors. 

The other thing is valve is working to optimize games, UIs and content to work around the steam deck and Linux, and plan to keep working on this SD for several years. Where other brands are just pushing this out at a high price and abandoning them for a newer model that comes out 9 months later. If I pay 400 for a steam deck I know I can keep upgrading it, modifying it and I know it will last, where I can't say the same thing about any competitors. 

That said the Steam Deck does have some major flaws and issues, and it can be a frustrating piece of hardware because of those glaring bugs and issues (specifically the online/offline connectivity issues which brick games until you can get on the internet again), and needing to restart my console once every 24hours because it will refuse to connect to the internet again after its been put into sleep mode, or will just randomly freeze up forcing me to restart.",SteamDeck

I swear I must be in some extremely small subset of people who realizes how amazing the touchpads mixed with the gyro is for aiming in FPS games for example.

I guess some factors can help them to hit a competitive price :

* They have much less work to do on software since they don't build a new Linux distro just for that. They just need to set up some drivers, maybe some custom launcher app (I haven't watched any videos of this device, but other handhelds running Windows generally have), and they are done.
* They are much more experienced in making hardware than Valve and the other handheld small companies that appeared around the Deck time, so they can don't need to waste time on learning/hiring.

What's more likely is $649 is for the base model, which will probably be marginally better than the steam deck owing to them not having trackpads, so they can put the costs onto something else.

jhst7i0,"I doubt the battery life will be that bad.  Probably comparable to the Steam Deck, but then you never can know for sure.🤔

As for the price, I totally wrote this thing off purely on probable price.  Asus starts off at an innate disadvantage here because they have to sell the hardware at a profit, like other handheld PC manufacturers.  They don't have a digital storefront to fall back on.

However, unlike other handheld PC manufacturers, they are a major hardware manufacturer and can manufacture these things at scale and sell these at regular retailers, both in physical stores and online stores and Asus has an actual presence in the West.

So while I don't believe the Ally will beat the Deck, I do think it will do much better than other non-Deck handheld PCs.

The battery stuff though…I’m skeptical people actually will want a super powerful handheld that’s only handheld for like 45 minutes at a time.

The problem I see with the ally isn't so much the device itself. I'm sure it will be great. But it's that I don't see a price where it both makes a profit for Asus _and_ sells well.

The Deck's success isn't about track pads or Steam OS or even Windows for that matter (though I think that can draw up to $100 US more without too much issue with superior hardware), it's about its price.

That said considering the ""PC the form factor of a Switch"" was a non-entity a year or so ago and now it's worthy of being a hot product category, I'm fine with competition. I just suspect that the price of this thing is going to sink any further discussion of it and that the value/experience portion of the equation that Valve has nailed is being undervalued. 

Like there's three points on the scale potentially:

\- Nintendo Switch: cheap, has Nintendo games, but doesn't run any of your existing stuff and needs you to buy or re-buy all their walled garden games

\- Steam Deck: mid-tier priced, runs your Steam library, has a fine tuned experience and is from a vendor willing to forego some amount of profit in exchange for further integration into their ecosystem (how many people on here say they've bought more Steam games once they had the Steam Deck?)

\- Devices from Asus, etc.: probably run better than Steam Deck, and being based on Windows increases out of the box compatibility with stuff like Destiny 2 but comes from a company without a great track record on interface experiences and who needs to make all their profit from the sale of the hardware since they don't see any % of game sales.

jhtt0jo,"Honestly, anyone asking for a higher resolution screen on the Steam Deck hasn't really put much thought into what they're asking for or why they think they want it. Absolute resolution is not as important as pixel density.

The Steam Deck's screen has slightly higher pixel density than a 20.5"" 4k monitor. That means as far as your eye is concerned, the Steam Deck screen is sharper and more detailed than basically any desktop monitor on the market. Unless you're complaining that 4k monitors are not high enough resolution for you when playing on desktop, the screen on the Steam Deck should be high enough resolution for you.

Meanwhile, bigger is not necessarily better. The higher resolution the screen, the more pixels the hardware has to push, which results in higher power draw and worse performance for significantly diminishing returns in terms of image quality. Sure, you could just run the game at a lower resolution, but if you're running at a resolution that the native resolution of your display does not divide evenly into, the image will end up looking softer and worse than on a lower-resolution display working at native resolution.

And here's hoping the games scale their UIs properly, because some games do not, which means at 1080p or higher the game UI ends up being unusably small. This is already a problem with some games at the Steam Deck's current resolution, and the problem would just be further exacerbated with a higher resolution one.

Now, will future Steam Decks have higher resolution screens? Probably. Other companies like Asus here are going to push it on their models as a way of differentiating their product from the Steam Deck, and most people are just going to think bigger equals better, so Valve will have to eventually match them just for optics. But in terms of ways they could improve the Steam Deck, a higher resolution is pretty low on the list in terms of having meaningful effect on the experience, IMO.",SteamDeck

I’ve most recently been playing Dirt Rally 2.0. Medium settings, 720p, at around 20W, I get 60 FPS locked.

I'd bet the larger battery more than makes up for the higher power consumption - if it's even higher.

Sure, actually rendering games at 1920x1080 uses more power than rendering that same game (on the same chip) at 1280x800. But upscaling techniques like FSR (2) should still make for a very nice image. Also, you get to use resolutions between 1280x800 and 1920x1080. You just have more flexibility.

jhup7un,I'm not one to throw away any device if it still works perfectly fine. But I will say I haven't touched my Switch once since getting my Deck. I just haven't had the need to. I rebought the games I liked on the switch on steam so I could have them on my deck.,SteamDeck

jht2lwc,Most people use Heroic launcher.,SteamDeck
jhtffvx,"There are many options, most notable ones that worked perfectly for me are Heroic and Lutris.   
With Lutris you should be able to launch most games even those that don't work with Heroic, from there it usually makes you download the Epic Launcher.   


But before any of that, you need to download ProtonUpQT and get the latest version of GE-Proton, this will fix any compatibility issues and also help download install/download additional resources your game might need to run.    
I could bore you writing the full tips/instructions but a quick google/youtube tutorial will help you get this set up in less than 5-10 mins.",SteamDeck

I've said this elsewhere on the internet but the Deck has the advantage of all of its control options and settings plus the Desktop Mode that lets it function as a handheld PC. All of these other devices just aim to PC game but oversimplified. The track pads especially make a lot of games a smooth experience on Deck, without those, the gyros, the hall effect sticks, the touch pad on the sticks, etc the Deck would not be as good as it is.

Hall effects analog inputs are a plus but not mandatory for me right now ( maybe in few years but it will not be limited to handheld). Trackpads a really good but not that important for me.

Many people use and benefit from that functionality and simply are never aware of it, because it just makes the experience more seamless and removes what might otherwise be a pain point or annoyance.

jhttegj,"They have been in the process of doing this since Windows 8.1.

Each item they move to the new settings is stripped of its ability to directly be interfaced with by the end user, and instead you have to rely on Window's settings to properly reflect what is going on.

The reason why they have been doing it piecemeal is because IT departments in various industries are actively opposed to this and often rely on being able to directly control the .dll modules, so they transferred everything that those departments didn't ***need***, and are slowly depreciating the rest.

Please note that this is not what I believe, this is what ***MICROSOFT*** has said. It is only a matter of time, the moats and the walls are about 60-80% complete in Windows 11, and 12 or 13 is likely when the transition will be done.",SteamDeck

Companies like ASUS are not innovators, they make middling hardware that tries to be price competitive, which they never can be with Valve. 

You need a company that truly understands the PC gaming market and has talented engineers to produce a viable competitor and off the top of my head I can think of a single company that fits that bill.

With GNU/Linux, you can just go and fix it if it bothers you that much.

SteamOS has Proton, which actually is on track to making old games, like Windows XP to Windows 7 era games, more playable than trying to run them on Windows 10 or 11. If you like games that don't take a lot of power, and are perfect for a handheld, that's great.


Here's a few things that are technically possible with Linux that haven't been implemented, but could be, and are forever impossible to do with Windows. They revolve around the [USB Gadgets](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/driver-api/usb/gadget.html) feature of the Linux kernel which is a way of giving the USB C port new capabilities:

- hook up your Steam Deck to a windows pc, mac, linux, or another steam deck, and have it pretend to be a usb Ethernet interface. Then, set up Internet Connection Sharing with it on Windows (or the analog on any other OS, including BeOS, AmigaOS, and anything else that supports Ethernet). Now your Steam Deck has the same internet connection as your computer, and you don't need a dock, usb Ethernet dongle, Ethernet cable, a free Ethernet port on your switch, etc. Useful for me since I don't have wifi where I am right now. Also useful because the USB 3 Gen 2 port is 10 Gbit/s, much faster than a typical 1 Gbit dongle, and 10 Gbit dongles and switches still cost a lot. You could also use it to install games directly from what's already on your PC's hard drive.

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it work as a Steam Controller

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it show up as a mass storage device, so you can copy over your files

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it act as an SD card reader, so you can transfer files to the SD card. Basically the same as what's above. But just the SD card.

- hook up two Steam Decks together, have one emulate an Ethernet dongle, and then do local multiplayer. Basically it's a modern Gameboy Link Cable. Use a USB hub on one central deck, and you can link up multiple Steam Decks. You could also eg use this to connect a Steam Deck to any other device, even an ROG Ally. So if you have multiple handhelds, you can play with your friends, just give them one and use the other one.

- pcie-over-usb. This could encapsulate pcie over the usb bus, possibly creating a way to use a thunderbolt-like enclosure that has a very simple cpu running linux, plus a gpu. You could get pcie x1 speeds. But see below for something better.

- hook up your Steam Deck to a pc, and have it act as an extra HDMI or Display Port display. You could even do controller + display over the same cable. This way you could basically have a full fledged gaming pc with no display or keyboard or mouse, and you'd tether your Deck to the pc and use the pc to render your games and display them on the Deck with zero lag. In fact, you could also transfer files through the same cable, so if you want to launch a game that isn't on the pc's ssd yet, the SD would quickly transfer it over via the usb cable. This would basically make any PC with a fast enough USB port an external gpu dock for the Steam Deck, except: it also has a faster cpu, and more ram, and the GPU gets full pcie x16 instead of x2 or x4 (whichever thunderbolt allows on a port, there are two kinds), and possibly better ssd, and maybe also better networking, cooling, and it would be quieter than the Deck. This is entirely feasible: the 1280x800 resolution on the Deck only requires 1.5 Gbit/sec (185 Megabytes/sec), whereas the USB port can handle many times more.

And the best thing is you wouldn't need any extra hardware for ANY OF THIS. And no hardware upgrades to the Deck. Just a cheap-ass usb c cable. That's literally the cheapest price of entry for any of the above functionality - it can't get cheaper than that. But of course, people would have to program them, and those programming tasks range from difficult but quick, to year+ projects (especially the last one)

In the general sense, yes. But unless that API is documented and intended to be utilized by 3rd party applications you're basically setting yourself up for a world of hurt. This is one way that OS changes break things - people using interfaces that are private that then change, causing a delay in rolling out security fixes.  


> more persistent than fiddling with group policies. 

I'm not sure how this is the case.

Anyway, this entire subthread is the same fearmongering that blew up in 2012 when Windows 8 dropped. UWP apps largely failed and Windows is no closer to being a walled garden. Hell even OS X isn't a walled garden, and people have been waiting for that for years.

ji15pr6,"Yep, this can happen occasionally when the file gets corrupted.

First, go to the [steam remote storage page](https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage) *(should be a section/item for “Steam Input Configs”, and the file name in there matching the AppID for your game)* and download the most recent controller config file. Just so it doesn’t overwrite it with the default one and if it does you’ll have a backup to re-place it.

Then select the app/game on your Steam Deck, and under the *”Developer”* contextual submenu, choose *”Clear Selected Controller Layout”*. This should clear out the controller settings file back to default, and fix the crashing. The game will of course create a new controller config file.

You’ll want to go into the path where it created that file, and replace it with the one you had backed up *(assuming you want those setting back)*.",SteamDeck

ji17lj5,"Thanks so much for the advice! 

It's really something I'm going to have to think about. I wouldn't mind doing it if there was a way I could set it up to my TV potentially but if I'd have to get a monitor I don't think I have the space in my apartment currently for that sort of setup.",SteamDeck

ji178ox,As in hooked to HDMI with a monitor and a keyboard + mouse setup. Essentially a desktop experience.,SteamDeck
ji18hga,"It would totally work on your TV, provided it has a HDMI connection :) The only thing is you'd need to buy a dock (with HDMI and USB connections) or a USB-hub, which is an extra cost. Were you thinking of buying a Steam Deck purely for Tabletop Sim, or will you play other games? If it's mainly for Tabletop, a laptop might be a more suitable option to tell the truth.",SteamDeck
ji192kl,"I was looking to play other games as well eventually as I see stuff I like on steam. But as of right now, this purchase is for TTS.

To tell you the truth, I don't have much experience gaming on a keyboard. Which is why I was much more excited for the steam deck. I currently have an Xbox and a switch so I'm much more used to gaming with controllers. 

I think buying a dock and connecting to the TV could totally work. I just looked at some on Amazon and they're not as expensive as I was expecting.",SteamDeck
ji1kji5,"I'd recommend the JSAUX docks if you want a third party one. And yeah the controller support on SteamOS is really good! It's very easy to play most games using the Deck's controls or by connecting another controller. If there's anything about a particular control scheme you don't like, there are a ton of remapping options.",SteamDeck
ji1xh1k,"Dock or Hub only matter for convenience. Functionally, there is no real difference. I bought some usb-c hubs with everything I needed for \~15 bucks and left them where I might use them, because I tend forget where I left such things :)Just make sure the hub can deliver enough power. 60W PD are pretty much minimum, 100W is what I bought.

Again, TTS with deck controls certainly works, so maybe you'll be happy with that after a while. I don't know of any game where I regularly use that many buttons, though, so I wanted to hint you in that direction.

In the end, I don't think you'll be sad about your decision. I have a laptop and found myself using the deck as a replacement for that but never the other way round. It's really versatile.",SteamDeck
ji3yaox,"Thank you for telling me that! I would of never known there was no difference between a dock and hub.

That's actually a good plan, I'll try to play one game with just the steam deck (I'll tell the group first beforehand) and if I hate it I'll order hub, mouse and keyboard on Amazon.",SteamDeck

Of course I then spent a few evenings doing tweaks like choosing the right artwork from the Steam ROM Manager (silly), figuring out which Zelda OoT I liked best (vital), getting gyro controls to work for OoT 3D (emudeck had the answer in one button and a reboot, which I only realised after much googling, so super easy and useful), and stuffing around with WUA and CHD compressed ROMs (which in hindsight was a bit pointless).",SteamDeck

Asus' Ally 120hz Freesync will be nice, battery life is unknown, 15w performance vs Deck is unknown, 1080p might neutralize APU power difference, Windows may suck on it, no trackpads, only 2 backbuttons, cooling system appears to be vastly superior.

ji3upzr,"according to benchmarks ROG Ally is being insanely overhyped just like the Aya Neo was, according to benchmarks its barely able to handle RDR2 720P 60FPS lowest settings with FSR. Steam Deck gets 40-50 fps at the same settings. at 1080P the most RDR2 will hit is around 40fps. hell even linus video talks about Horizon Zero Dawn having performance between 20fps-40fps and you can see RE4 having performance issues. people always fall for the hype",SteamDeck
ji3v2kg,"I'm not sure how the Ally is going to be, but having basically every game playable on the deck is pretty awesome and it might not have that. It's great for emulation too, not just steam games.",SteamDeck
ji3vmnn,"Even if I didn’t already own the Steam Deck, I’d still buy a Steam Deck over the Asus handheld.

£350 for the 64GB model (what I have) is unbelievably hard to beat on value compared to every other handheld PC",SteamDeck
ji3rubk,"The official pricing and availability announcement for the Ally is May 11th. 

Right now, everything being discussed is based on speculation, rumor, and leaks. The only official word from Asus, until the 11th, is ""It will be below $1,000"" and ""It will be available for purchase sooner than most people think"". 

The other thing we know is that it is using a custom APU from AMD. Initial benchmarks put its performance at 11% higher OpenCL score over the Ryzen 6800U (chip in the Ayaneo 2). The Ayaneo 2 performs about 20% better than the Steam Deck in most titles. This is operating at a TDP of 30w, with the Z1 Extreme operating at speeds up to 5ghz -- leaving many questions about battery life and cooling. 

The rumored/leaked pricing is $700, and the availability date is rumored to be as early as Q3 of this year. Other than that, there is nothing more to base a purchase on until May 11th. 

So the question you have to ask yourself is if there is a chance you are willing to pay between $700 and $1,000 for an Ally to achieve 20 to 30% more frames per second over a Steam Deck. Also, keeping in mind that with the power consumption and cooling concerns, that performance may only be feasible when docked. 

If the answer is yes, then wait until May 11th to get at least basic info, if not longer to start seeing real product reviews (and not just paid marketing pieces). If the answer is no, then I would still wait until May 11th to be absolutely sure, and if you're not blown away, *then* put in your order for a Steam Deck.",SteamDeck
ji3t3iv,Always remember support is way more important then minor increases.  I do not think its going to be 2x faster in real life usage and I am sure you will not have the steamOS experience or the best controls I have ever used.

I think the Ally will be more expensive, I've seen US$700 ""leaked"" for the top of the range one.",SteamDeck
ji3xi6w,"Ok, so to break this down (again):  The Rog Ally is clearly a device that focuses on super fancy aesthetic showmanship and ""Super big power!!!"" to try and market itself, instead of actually focusing on the stuff that would make it a good handheld.

It might be good, but generally this kind of marketing tends to imply that it's going to be lacking in a lot of other areas.  We don't know how good the control customization is going to be on the Ally, we know that it apparently only gets battery life comparable to the Deck when both are running at 15w(And the thing goes up to..30w I think? So, y'know, that's definitely not good).

We also know it has a 1080p screen which 'sounds' nice, but keep in mind that means that games on the Ally are going to require more power, which means battery life might be a concern.  Another thing is if they're trying to price competitively with the Steam Deck, that means that build quality is definitely going to be a concern, since they're clearly putting so much focus on the ""power"".

And of course there's also the lack of trackpads, I STILL haven't seen any confirmation of gyro, etc.  Keep in mind that you'd be paying more for a system that basically can only play games with controller support, and you better hope that controller support is good.  All this for a system that's only going to maybe do a little bit better in some games.

If you want an idea of just what the Ally is probably going to be, Bringus Studios did a video on the [ONEXPLAYER 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5OFC3wESc), which is probably going to be very similar to the Ally in a lot of ways in terms of performance(And I'mma be honest, it's probably going to perform better than the Ally.).",SteamDeck
ji403w0,"Nobody can actually answer this since the Ally has nothing but marketing hype to go off of. If it lived up to that hype it would be a very strong contender, with the Deck's main advantages coming in the touchpads/extra buttons and open platform allowing repairs and community tweaks better than the Ally's closed platform windows environment. On the other hand, the Ally would have very strong performance going for it.

That being said:

Two less back buttons and no touchpads (and thus no virtual menus) is a no for me, even if I wasn't deeply unimpressed with the actual benchmarks we have for the Ally thus far. I don't use the touchpads for every game, but for the games I do, they're vital.

And don't even get me talking about the lack of pause function. Trying to put games to sleep in Windows is a bad joke.

Even the horsepower argument doesn't hold up too well IMO. RDR2 at 70 FPS for the extreme Ally sounds insanely impressive until you look at the fine print and discover it's 720p upscaled to 1080p, all settings on low, at a *30w TDP - Literally twice as much as the Deck.* For something that claims to be like 3/4ths of a PS5 and like 2-3x the raw horsepower of a Deck, I expected much more. 

The cheap Ally? Same battery-destroying TDP and same poor settings, except you get like +5FPS better than a Deck running the same game. Is 5 FPS worth having a battery that lasts an hour or less? 

Unless AMD's released benchmarks are lying, the Ally is a lot less awesome than ASUS' paid marketing hype would have us believe. 

Honestly, the more I think about the Ally the more I doubt it actually has a niche. Its only real advantages are performance and anticheat/gamepass compatibility. But to get its performance you need to run off a 30w TDP according to AMD's benchmarks. This basically means you're chained to a wall outlet.

But if you're giving up the portable part of a handheld, why would you buy an Ally when you could buy a desktop that'll have vastly more performance? You can build a pretty nice desktop for $700 for the Ally's alleged asking price and it'll be about as portable in practice lol. 

  
So yeah, the more I learn of the Ally and peer through the hype, the less impressed I get.",SteamDeck

I’ve had a mostly good experience with the Steam Deck. There’s certain things about it that are really limiting though. There’s a lot of multiplayer games that will not work on Steam OS due to conflicts with the anti cheat used by the game. For the most part, I don’t really care to play MP on a handheld, but there’s some games I would like to sometimes play and chill/grind out challenges or whatever instead of playing them at my desk on PC. That just isn’t an option unless I install Windows. 


It does play older games really well, even some of the notoriously bad PC ports work well on the Deck. I recently replayed GTA IV, locked 40FPS throughout. A very pleasant experience. Great too for Fallout 3/NV/Oblivion/Skyrim. Even Fallout 76 runs pretty well on the Deck in my experience with it. 


That said, you have to really temper your expectations for newer big budget games. To the point that I wouldn’t recommend buying a Steam Deck if you’re wanting to primarily play the latest releases on it. 


As for the Asus handheld. I think the hardware looks good. I’m glad to see AMD pushing out newer mobile APUs designed with handhelds in mind. I think the device’s fate will be determined heavily on how Asus handles the software side of it. I’ve personally had a bad time on that front with Asus in the past. 


Long story short, I bought an Asus Zephyrus laptop for my girlfriend some years back. On paper, the specs were good. It had great reviews from YouTubers for being an affordable and competent gaming laptop. In reality, it was hot and loud, and to add to the pain, mostly required Asus’ armoury crate software to control the different profiles. 

The cherry on top was a bug that resulted in the CPU getting locked to 400mhz randomly. Not an issue related to temps at all. It just did it when it decided it wanted to ruin any enjoyment you were having in game by plummeting the FPS into the single digits. This issue was never fixed via software/bios updates either. 


So I’m quite skeptical personally of the Asus Ally.",SteamDeck

ji3zovt,"The title was not the best choice then but I’m sorry for misinterpreting you.

I’ve had fun with the Steam Deck. The SteamOS gaming mode interface is very much like a console experience so it’s pretty easy to get used to. It runs Linux so game compatibility is not as good as a dedicated Windows machine so if you’re looking to play stuff that requires anti-cheat software like competitive shooters, you’d be better off with a Windows machine. 

There are a lot of community projects that enhance the experience like Emudeck for emulation or Decky Loader for plugins. Overall, I’d say the software experience is kind of a gift and a curse in that it’s constantly getting more and better updates, but in the end, it’ll always require Proton, the translation layer that makes Windows games run on Linux, and therefore it’s always a moving target in terms of compatibility. In my experience, the only hiccup I’ve had with a game that was marked “playable” by Valve was due to a 3rd party launcher from Ubisoft.

And ergonomics and button layout is a personal preference thing. Some people find it comfy (myself included) and others find it cumbersome so YMMV.",SteamDeck

jhx14hk,"I do something similar professionally with scientific software on large linux clusters, and have some tips:

1. I would set -e at the start as well as -x.  This will cause it to exit on errors where a step fails - makes it easier to debug.  I'd also set -u as that will cause it to halt if an environment variable is unset.

2. I would set all the variables with the URLS/versions near the top so they are easy to find. You can also do a neat construct like this:

VARIABLENAME=${VARIABLENAME:-default_value) 

This sets the variable to a default value unless it's already set in the environment - this is really neat because at launch you could do something like:

origin_url=url_to_mirror ./NonSteamLaunchers.sh 

to override where it downloads from at run time.

3. If you continue with the route where you download specific, non-changing versions of the installers then I'd encode in sha512sum checks of the files to make sure they have downloaded properly - we run into issues all the time with software developers changing the location of download files and you end up trying to unpack an html error page :(

It will affect the launcher prefix, which can lead to a different launcher/game failing to run.

It would be better to have each launcher in its own respective prefix and having each of one brand's games dependent on that prefix. That way when EA eventually breaks and requires a different runner from Ubisoft, you don't break the currently working one or trigger a logout due to a runner change. All of EA's games will remain logged in as they share the one EA prefix, etc.

jhv0t0b,"This script shouldn't conflict with anything you have installed at the moment... as long as you have enough space, it will install the launchers with the latest protonGE and install without you touching anything. I made it specifically to do that and clean up files and everything. This also installs in a whole different proton prefix so it won't conflict with nothing you have. You still have to add .exe to steam manually. I'm currently working on that.",SteamDeck
ji0sz77,Try putting it in the desktop and then run it,SteamDeck
jhv22gg,"> But that's what a windows PC does no?

Yes, but Wine interactions are different than an actual Win PC. They have different fixes and hacks to get things running. Each game can require different ones, and some may conflict with others as you start layering them in.

> if Diablo needs a specific proton then run it with that. You can mix and match what launcher runs with what and what game runs with what.

Diablo is dependent on the battle.net prefix. When you run the game in that prefix and change the runner, you are changing the files within the prefix to reflect the changed version of Proton. This can overwrite another set of fixes applied for another game. 

It's a better practice to not mess with another game's prefix when it's working. This process of sharing prefixes goes the exact opposite direction from that.

Again, if space is a concern, just use btrfs. if you have files that are common across multiple prefixes (which is the case for a lot of prefixes), they won't take up extra space for each duplicate version. I save ~8GB on my Deck just in prefix deduplication alone.",SteamDeck
jhysjzm,"But...Heroic actually **replaces** some of the launchers entirely, and in that case you don't need to run a set of scripts by another person on the internet that, I don't mean this disrespectfully, doesn't seem to have an intense background in linux programming.

jhzyc72,"That's not ideal. If you did this to any EA games on Steam, you effectively broke the game by removing a major dependency.

Every compatdata folder is a different game's prefix. You shouldn't arbitrarily delete data from them.

jhzyk6n,"The reason I deleted the Ea content was because an update for the client broke everything. mass effect wasn’t recognized as installed but I could still see it in the file structure taking up 110gb. I wiped it all out hoping to start over

One thing I notice, is that the GPU and CPU usage seem a bit low. For a game to be struggling this much, while not maxing out the CPU or GPU usage… that seems like poor optimization and engine bugginess. They could try manually setting the CPU or GPU higher to see if it helps.",SteamDeck
ji18l9z,"I'm done buying these games. This would have been an easy sale to me, but looks like I will be patient and wait for the game to be fixed and on sale. If they never get it running on Steam Deck it'll be perhaps a long wait and a deep sale.",SteamDeck

ji1r9ua,i mean….. i think this sub was coping hard if they thought this game would run decently on deck. jedi fallen order still doesn’t go past 40fps consistently on its lowest setting and this game is significantly more resource intensive,SteamDeck

ji0wm8d,we can always undervolt and overklocked the steamdeck.....,SteamDeck
ji2tb62,The game certainly could be better optimised but from what I can see it's usually vram issue deck can have up to 8GB the game uses more. I Also seen 4090 gameplay that didn't properly use CPU that was at 40% and GPU at 33%...,SteamDeck
ji11rnk,"Yea; just a thought. It depends on which *(CPU or GPU intensive)* the game is though. In any case, I thinks it’s not hardware issues we’re seeing here.",SteamDeck
ji20m59,"Fallen Order doesn't go past 40 on low, but it also maintains 30 comfortably on high settings (with the exception of some of the slide/chute sections, which see framerates collapse across the board on every platform). 

It's the same story on a lot of games. 60 fps on Red Dead 2 is impossible, but you can get a stable 30 comfortably on a mix of high and ultra settings everywhere outside St Denis. The CPU on the deck can't push 60 fps in post-2015 or so era demanding games, but it can play most very comfortably and at good settings/native resolution.",SteamDeck
ji0zaan,You could refund it and keep the files on your deck. Valve doesn’t make you delete the game,SteamDeck
ji0wrh1,Agreed. I’d rather just wait for the patch and hope I can atleast get 40,SteamDeck

Most notable tips-

*Use latest Proton-GE (Apply compatibility layer in game mode) after adding the game's .exe as a non-steam game. (Don't use the launcher .exe as that just gives an infinite loading screen)

*Rename the EPIC folder (Example EPIC.bck) or the game will crash after the opening cutscene. Doing this will skip the beginning and ending cutscene but the rest of the game should be fine

ji005eu,"Yea i get what you mean. It doesn’t matter. The renderer will only ever do/use one at a time.

It’s like of you tell someone who has one hand free to hold your coffee. Then someone else comes along and tells them to hold their beer. If it’s going to do what person 2 tells it, it has to stop doing what person 1 told it to do.

So for instance, in Cyberpunk 2077, I can tell it not to use anything, but set the resolution to 1152x720, and set to use full screen. In the performance overlay, it will show **FSR: ON**. But if I go into Cyberpunk’s settings, and tell it to turn on FSR2.1, the system overlay will then show FSR: OFF; because it automatically stops doing it that way.

Same happens if you toggle the in-game FSR1 to on; I tried that in Horizon Zero Dawn as well.

So you never have to worry about the OS-level one. It will just do it’s thing **when needed** if it can *(game is set to full screen and using a lower than native res)*.

I make good use of it when connecting my Deck to my 1080p TV to maintain the same performance. I tell the app/game in Steam’s settings to run at 1280x720 *(but the external display is set to 1080p)*, and it upscales it using FSR so it looks good at 1080p, but the performance is same/similar to when I am using the Deck’s display *(which is 1280x800)*.",SteamDeck

Thanks for the tip. This is one thing I am a little confused about. I've seen screen shots where people have RetroArch as a standalone item in their library they can launch. I haven't figured out how to add this. RetroArch isn't one of the parsers in Steam Rom Manager. The individual emulator cores in RetoArch are.

So how do you add RetroArch to your library and access it to adjust the settings you are talking about?

A lot of it was because I already had several emulation devices. I have a Raspberry Pi in a Mini-NES case running Emulation Station and several hand-held devices. Part of it was that I just didn't want risk messing something up on Steam Deck.

Yes, you are right emulating psp on a touch screen exclusively would not be a good experience. But luckily I have physical buttons to push.

10 years ago I have played through Persona 3 Portable  2-3 times. Since then I've played Mana Khemia through 2 times. I played several other JRPGs, and several Pokemon games (yeah, not psp, ds).

Portable gaming for me means portability and playing anywhere, anytime, no special preparations required, during commuting, standing, sitting etc. My Switch, which I quite like, barely qualifies for some of that, for me the Deck which I also quite like, absolutely does not.

My phone however does, and always have.

ji0ky4x,What I think is the best way to play it is to get Nvidia GeForce now. Xbox cloud gaming runs terribly. You can only use the free version but if you only pay $10 you can play with the highest settings,SteamDeck

ji0gkf9,Totally viable way to play; I've been playing Fortnite this way for about a year at this point,SteamDeck
jhyx24e,Games like rimworld,SteamDeck
jhz17rm,"I love my steam deck, and part of the major reasons why is because of the insane power of controller configuration that's afforded by the trackpads. I never thought I would be able to play rimworld, factorio, CK3, CIV6, starbound, project zomboid, kenshi, any of these games any more in a handheld form factor, but just customizing the controls for 10-15 minutes makes all the difference in the world.

Even for FPS games, simply setting hotkeys with the left thumbpad as a touch radial menu is a complete game changer and I can't imagine going back to NOT using these....

For CK3/ Rimworld/ CIV, i have the left trackpad set to automatic hotkeys for all of the most used pages. Its' WAY easier than scrolling around with the right trackpad to click on things. It's even easier compraed to full mouse and keyboard because literally nobody can rememebr all of the hotkeys...

I've even made myself action sets where I can hold down L4 and completely change what kind of touch menu the left thumbpad is. Extremely useful for different map layers like in CK3

I would be a LOT more excited for the ROG ally if it had trackpads. Unfortunately I think you can only play xinput games on this thing, which is a damn shamed because while that's cool and all, there's way more games I wanna play beyond just controller games...

However, I'm still thrilled that the steam deck is showing manufacturers that there big market for PC handhelds (and gaming handhelds in general tbh beyond just the switch) and honestly, as gaming consumers we stand to ALL benefit from this. If more developers know that being able to be played comfortably on a handheld screen is a major selling point, then steam deck owners benefit as well (namely in optimization, UI scaling, etc).

I hope the ASUS ROG Ally sells extremely well even though I have no intention of getting one myself.

Also while I don't use them this way, they are accurate enough to use for FPS games but it takes practice and most people just don't.

But input choices are a personal thing... For example I don't use joysticks for FPS games unless I absolutely have to because I don't find them as usable as M+K.",SteamDeck
jhz0bd1,"I use them for aiming, diaganonal d pad movement and extra buttons for older PC games or keyboard heavy games",SteamDeck

jhyxqjl,"I'm still trying to find a good use for them other than the onboard keyboard. I've tried mouse based games like Pillars of Eternity, but it just feels janky. Both unresponsive and too responsive at the same time, if that makes sense.

I feel like I am avoiding games that would take advantage of them because I really don't want to go through the learning curve, and I'm happy to stick to games in my backlog that are optimized for consoles and controllers.

I know eventually I will have to bite the bullet and really try at some point, but not until I can get a good experience and motivation to push through the learning curve.",SteamDeck
jhz0prp,I think it's to prevent you from destroying your sticks in Mario Party minigames,SteamDeck
jhz9984,"As an example, I recently started playing Sacred 2 on the Deck.

I use the right trackpad for mouse movement.

The left trackpad does a lot of work though:

In the default action set, it is set to Directional Swipe, with each direction changing to an action set that has the left trackpad use a different radial menu until it is no longer touched, at which point it reverts to the default action set:

* Left swipe's menu switches between the 5 weapons.
* Right swipe's menu binds to the 5 combat arts (skills/spells).
* Upward swipe's menu binds to 6 assignable potions plus a health potion.
* Downward swipe's menu accesses UI stuff (character, inventory, combat arts, world map, log book).

Definitely something that takes some getting used to, though.",SteamDeck
jhzcb04,"Everything. Basically I always map the left trackpad to a 4-button cross with custom assignments; and add a button chord if I want more. Often I will even map up/down to mouse scroll, and left/right to some other functions. Right trackpad is always mapped to Mouse most times with press being left-click.

It’s effortless to just use the trackpads when needed for precision clicks or the UI in certain games. Much faster is many cases.

In other games, I will create a virtual menu for the trackpads with various functions. Like when I am using the Yuzu emulator, I created a Virtual menu with all the commands. In Elder Scrolls online I have a Virtual Menu on each trackpad, while still also being able to use the right trackpad as a Mouse/Click when I hold L5.

It is also a game changer in Real Time Strategy games as you can assign the trackpad to correlate to the minimap section *(of the screen)* specifically when your finger is on it.

Steam Input’s configuration essentially makes those two trackpads into Chads. I cannot even begin to consider using a handheld without those *(and the 4 back grip buttons)* anymore. It’s like a handicap being without them.",SteamDeck

jhywz79,I use them as joysticks. They are great once you configure them and get used to them.,SteamDeck
jhz0a7k,"From what I have read on here, you need to change the controller set up in a lot of cases to make the Touch Pads work well. You can also use them to assign multiple inputs to them for certain games to allow you to use hotkeys easily etc. I know one person said they changed the setting on the touch pad to make it mapped to the entire screen, so where they touched on the touch pad related to a point on the screen, so they could quickly (and apparently quite accurately) move the mouse to anywhere on the screen. 

I haven't personally played around with the Touch Pads yet, but I do love my RTS, so when I get round to installing some on the Deck I will have a mess around and find out the best ways to utilise the touch pads because it sounds like it is necessary for those games.",SteamDeck

jhz8tzb,"Steam input, the left menu button opens up a window, and if you hover over the game it will allow you to change the controller layout, there's even community ones, though not all are for deck(but you will see if it is from a deck image) but they still work",SteamDeck
jhz9q6l,"haha i absolutely hate trying to use the touchpads as analog sticks.... That has never felt good to me.

As far as I know every single game SHOULD support this (even non steam games!), since you're just simulating a keyboard press or something. I imagine even gamepad games would support if you want the touchpad to simulate an ""A"" press on a gamepad or something but not sure why you'd wanna do that. If you have a game that is strictly either CONTROLLER only or KEYBOARD only maybe you can only map inputs to whatever's been set, but this is pretty rare, most games are smart about taking in inputs.

You basically go into the settings->controller configurations and navigate to the touchpads, and you can choose for them to behave as ""touch menu"" or ""touch radial menu"". A very basic example of how to set this up is you know how in many FPS the guns can be quick selected by 1-9, or in an MMO like world of warcraft you have a ton of skills that you can access to 1-9?

Just go to set a touch menu, and have an input set as ""1"", then ""2"", and so on and so forth. Now when you just set your left thumb on the touchpad, a menu will show up with all of your inputs, just thumb over to what you want, press down, and you have that input. You can even name each one and even set tiny cute little images for each thing (i love doing this for FPS games, cute little pictures of shotguns, pistols, rocket launchers, etc). This is WAY better than what most shooters on controller do, which is either just slowly tabbing through every gun, or basically a hard pause and select whatever you want, the left thumbpad affords near instantaneously/ seamless switching. You can even customize color, opacity, menus size, position, haptic feedback, etc.

Take this to the next level with something like Crusader Kings 3. Realm, Military, Council are F1 through F whatever, let's set a touch menu that lets you access them immediately, versus having to awkwardly pan up with the mouse clicker. But there's SO many other hotkeys in this game, right? Namely stuff like Map layers, based on de jure kingdoms, religions, cultures. You'd get a pretty damn crowded touchpad with all of these hotkeys! No worries, set an action layer. Basically what an action layer is is you press a button (for example, L4), and while holding this down, it changes the inputs of something to something completely different. Create a new action layer for the left thumbpad called ""Map Mode"", and hotkey the map modes you want. Now you can use the left thumpad for general gameplay to thumb through the standard pages, or hold the L4 to do the same but for map modes. Insanely easy, and honestly EASIER to use (since you can have written down + an image of what actual hotkeys you're selecting) than a keyboard since nobody can remember any of those anyway.

Don't even get me started to how you can pair the capacitive touch of the joysticks to allow multiple actions at once. Like for kenshi, you have to hold down control to pan the camera around in the 3d plane. kind of annoying, right? Just make the ""right thumbstick touch"" to ""Control"" and you can now use the right thumbstick as a 3d Camera....

You can even program inputs as ""swipes"" or ""double taps"" or ""long press"" or ""hold"" it's insane. Imagine swiping up on the left thumpad to simulate a ""mouse scroll up"" to let you dynamically and smoothly zoom in and out (add in a turbo press for some zing) in a 4X game....

All of this is not very well described by valve, and for good reason too. You can almost do anything with the amount of controller configuration at your fingertips, and if valve dumped a massive tutorial on new players it would be terrifying/ overwhelming. (The PC world guide above is a good start). I have no doubt the majority of people are happily just chugging along playing their standard xinput controller games but man, learning about the controller configuration and spending 10-15 minutes in some games just making the game play more smoothly is so worth it, has made me love the device like, 10 fold more than before.

Which is why I think the ROG Ally isn't gonna be a buy from me, simply since it's just basically a simple xbox controller. Which is fine for SOME games, but there is an entire galaxy of games that simply won't work on the device, and that's a damn shame.",SteamDeck

The menu shows up onscreen when you put your thumb on the touchpad, and you can see what option you're selecting. They're great for games with a ton of inputs.

I find a 3x3 grid works best, and I mostly use it to bind 1-9 for games with an action bar along the bottom to select tools/weapons.

jhw6hug,"I'll put it like this lol; both my Deck and my PS5 are connected via WiFi. Not just any wifi either, it's the $10/month-with-food-stamps WiFi and my router is located in my living room which is in the middle of the house, my PS5 is in my bedroom in the back of the house, and I'm able to connect and play from my deck while sitting in my car parked on the street in front of my house, connected to the same wifi network. As you might imagine, this is far from the ideal setup lmao but it is surprisingly ""stable"" so I know if I brought my PS5 into the living room and plugged in the Ethernet cable and upgraded my internet plan, my guy I would probably not even feel like I'm not playing the games directly on my deck. Chiaki is surprisingly stable. It's honestly more stable than my PSP Go/PS3 remote play (which I shamelessly still use to this day) and better yet, more stable than my Vita 2k/PS4 remote play setup I used to have. TLDR; she's a spicy meatball and very stable and unbelievably easy to set up",SteamDeck

jhwoebj,That's just your local connection it has nothing to do with your internet to use it remotely away from your network now that's the challenge and can easily be done but requires your external up address and some port forwarding,SteamDeck
jhvf59x,Ohh okay cool. Maybe I'll try chiaki4deck since I do get a good deal of artifacting so hopefully that'll fix it,SteamDeck
jhypoo1,Yeah and that's where they'll lose me. The PSP and the Vita was around 200-250 and they were their own systems with their own exclusive games so it was more justifiable. A device that does the same thing as a free app on my phone that they provide themselves is not worth 200. I was being generous with 150 but realistically I understand that you're probably right. I wonder if they'll pull a R* and remove remote play from the app stores in order to push units lol remember R* did that with the older GTA games to launch the definitive editions?,SteamDeck
jhx67p4,I’ve been using chiaki4deck and have been amazed at its performance.  It streams a lot smoother than doing a remote play from my PC to the deck,SteamDeck

Spiderman Miles Morales, Jedi Survivor, Morrowind (OpenMW), Everspace 2, Lego Star Wars, Red Dead Redemption 2 (I spend sooo much time online), Saints Row 4/Gat out of Hell, The Outer Worlds, Dark Souls Remastered

I have various levels of progress in the prior games but I have never beat them. I got all the way to the end of The Outer Worlds and haven't touched it because I'm finding the DLC hard and that was over a year ago... Possibly warrants a replay at this point

Morrowind... Man... I like this game but it is so hard to get into unless you dedicate all your time to it and continue coming back

Dark Souls Remastered... I'm stuck in the first city still in a constant loop. Multiplayer really saved these games for me because I was able to play with my brother who kicks ass at them but uhh... I'm not good at them. He won't play this one with me for some reason. Says the MP is too complicated to do or something

Games making beating the prior hard:

Ark Survival Evolved, Evil Dead The Game, Sea of Thieves, Poker Night 2, Sons of the Forest, No Man's Sky, Chivalry 2, Star Wars Battlefront 2, Kerbal Space Program

jhwltbx,"Well seems like that in 2.1 Emudeck's scope is migrating from being an emulation solution to be more like a ""emulation + other homebrew storefront"". 

EmuDecks focus seams to be broad and make it work on as many OS as possible. While ours is more narrow and only focusing on providing a deeper emulation experience inside the application itself when you use it. 

RetroDECK is focusing on the ease of having one application that you can just install and don't need to maintain any others.
Our scope is to provide a solution that once it's installed on your system you just need to update in inside the normal software update channels (Discover). 
We are also trying to bring more and expanded functionality inside the fully integrated RetroDECK framework that goes across all emulators.  

Just grab your games and play, no other configuration is needed as it's everything already bundled (except the actual roms and bios). But for the hardcore users we are planning more functions that no one else does for ease of tweaking and other secret things (wait for 0.7b!),",SteamDeck
jhwl8n0,"RetroDECK is an contained integrated application that gives you a single ES-DE interface where you can browse and play emulated games. 
Every emulator is bundled, tweaked and optimized for being used on the Steam Deck (and later other SteamOS devices and Linux Desktop). 

We are aiming to the simplicity for the user: put your roms and bioses and just play without having the need to configure anything. 

For the more experienced users however we are providing a tool named the RetroDECK Configurator that gives you access to all the single emulators, configurations and customization tools. 

In the next version (actually on the ""cooker"" preview channel) we will have a seamless experience with the hotkeys: forget which emulator you're using, it will have the same hotkeys and expanded functions can be accessed from a radial menu during the game-play. 

RetroDECK is a full bundle that doesn't alter the other software that you got on the Steam Deck. When you update your steam deck all will be contained inside RetroDECK.

NOTE: We are still in BETA.",SteamDeck

The answer is because battery percent on lithium batteries is not an indicator of that actual charge. Zero percent still has lots of charge in the battery. And 100% is the max safe working voltage, but not the max that you can put into the battery. Going above or below those voltages can damage the battery, so the computer doesn't allow it happens.

Just remember, if you're on PC you can use the standalone versions or Steam, but when buying additional content it HAS TO BE on the same version. So you can't use Steam expansions with the standalone and vice versa. Don't know why, that's just how it is.

For making gil, you're not going to for quite a while (gotta finish the campaign and get into expansions) but crafting is generally where it's at. Thankfully you don't have too many expenses as you're levelling though, but some of the gear on the AH will be enticing for how it looks. Just sell any decent gear drops on the AH that you don't need as people looking for quick purchases while levelling alts will often buy things rather than take the time to earn them, and you'll sometimes have something useful for a glamour.

Until you're way further in the game, don't worry about it too much as you're going to be changing gear frequently and it won't help to be burning your Gil on stuff you'll soon get rid of.

Also 4k has been a cancer for storage space, about 0.5% of gamers have a 4k supported TV or PC yet ALL gamers have to download 50-80 GB of game data for those unnecessary 4k assets. 

I’d rather play an indie game that’s actually fun than another “generic AAA game 3: deluxe edition 90gb”


Triple A gaming is DEAD. Corporate america killed it. There hasn’t been any good games since ps3 era and the abundance of remasters proves this. There are still international and japanese developers making decent games like Nier, mario etc and these games are usually under 30gb in size due to the devs actually treating the games as art as opposed to another product. 


Publishes became too rich and have too much control now for AAA games. You can today find indie games that look better and play better, and are infinitely more fun and orignal than the same rehased bullshit you see with all these big developers.

I’ll never get jedi order unless it’s on the seven seas. That’s my rule for all AAA games going forward. If it’s not free, i’m not getting it. I’ll happily buy stardew valley for the 3rd time tho, and any other indie games i like. I bought steelrising for $40 and it’s one of my most played games on deck, i’m fine if nobody plays it it’s asouls like game anyway and i don’t like games that everyone is playing anyway because they’re usually shite like cyberpunk or gotham knights",SteamDeck

I have noticed a difference in input. 
Things like I playing csgo with a keyboard and mouse, in desktop it worked as a pc, in game mode somehow the mouse was acting as a joystick.",SteamDeck
jhx6kon,"The two big differences are:

* They  use two different compositors. Game Mode uses gamescope (wayland) and Desktop Mode uses X11. That may account for your graphical glitches since gamescope is from Valve and X11 is the base Linux compositor.
* There is an overall mouse control overlay in Desktop Mode. I believe there are actually 2 layers to this. One is the more functional that works while you have Steam running. If you close Steam, then you'll get the basic one that only has touchpad movement and left/right click via the triggers.

That last one is one to watch out for since you could accidentally override your desktop controls by messing with controls within a game and you'll either have to plugin keyboard/mouse or reboot to get out of it.",SteamDeck
jhx6mpl,"They use different display servers. Desktop mode uses x, which is older and has wider support. Game mode uses Wayland which is newer, has better performance (usually), slightly worse support for somethings, and has built in vsync. Some of the deck's features like capping frame rate use tools that only work in Wayland.

And since it's running native, I find it uses very little wattage, runs silky smooth, and looks better. It also seems that Luxtorpeda even sets up controller support, but I could be wrong there, but from my testing I didn't have to fiddle with much of anything. Just set the compatibility layer to Luxtorpeda, run the game, it downloads and installs the ports and starts the game up flawlessly. (Big props to the Luxtorpeda team).

jhtx1pv,"Without giving to much personal info away online, I'm definitely no spring chicken myself. I felt like I probably wasn't doing it right for the longest time with flick-stick, but it just takes time to adjust, and I understand if you don't think it's worth it. 

Personally, I think the jump in accuracy from normal right stick look to right stick look with gyro assist is a bigger jump and way easier to adjust to. Flick-stick will improve response time and accuracy even a bit more than gyro alone, but at the cost of a sharp learning curve. Flick-stick also requires settings that have to be tuned on a per game basis.",SteamDeck

jhubklk,"Steam Deck is the same as PC user base. So if your friends also have PCs, it’s not cross platform *(ie. it’s the same platform)*. So pretty much any shooter that they have on PC *(if they are on PC)* you can play.  The issue of difference will be if any of those games have anti-cheat restrictions that only work on Windows.

Division 2 is a great squad-based *(and solo)* looter/shooter game. Star Wars Battlefront 2/1 also works great. I believe the Halo Master Chief collection also works on SteamOS now also. Overwatch can also be run on SteamOS.

If the game you pick needs Windows because of anti-cheat software, you can always setup Windows on a MicroSD and boot into that for those select games.

Now as far as actual cross platform games, like cross-platform between consoles *(like XBOX/PlayStation)* and PC; the I am not positive, but someone else may be able to answer.",SteamDeck

jhvslex,I’ve never played any of the campaigns are those included? And which one is the best most popular to play online! Thanks,SteamDeck
jhuxq3w,Please!,SteamDeck
jhvynn5,"Depending on what version you buy, the $40 ($20 on sale usually) version includes all 6 games (including the 2 remasters for CE and 2; CEA and 2A), but you can also buy them piece-meal for $5 each (also here if you buy CE or 2 you also get CEA or 2A, respectively)

The most popular multiplayer versions are 3, 2, Reach and CE (1), in that order. The only one that isn’t very popular for online play is 4 (and ODST, but that’s basically a DLC for 3 and never had MP to begin with)

All 6 run very well on PC seeing as they’re all more than a decade old. The remasters (CE Anniversary and 2 Anniversary) are a bit more taxing, but the CE remaster isn’t good anyway (they ruined the art style) so shouldn’t be played. The only good version that’s hard to run is the remaster of 2, which isn’t ideal for the Steam Deck. 

Keep in mind for multiplayer that there is a 2A filter, which isn’t in the same engine as the 2A campaign. 2A’s multiplayer runs in 4’s engine, and plays very differentely to the original 2 multiplayer. For this reason, it’s not very popular in multiplayer.",SteamDeck

thats odd. maybe your router has some kind of ""allow list"".  
 if so, most likely based on mac-adresses enabled as a kind of security feature so no unknown devices can log in. 

depending on the GUI of the router they could name that anything... whitelist, allow-list, allowed-devices ... something of that sort.

maybe browse through the settings or google the model together with ""mac adress"" *(You probably know, but it's the unique adress of a wifi device looking like a bunch of numbers and letters like: fe80::3039:769c...)* 

the ""disabled"" bit could also point to a setting on the deck. but this then should be the same for other wifi's as well. there'd be different approaches to this, depending on the ""root cause"".",SteamDeck

jhvg2mx,"Higher refresh rates will always give a lower response time…but if you’re not matching that refresh rate evenly, you will get uneven frame pacing. More even frame pacing (40fps at 40hz) would feel less responsive than 40fps at 60Hz but visually, 40fps at 40hz will look smoother.",SteamDeck
jhvim2g,"It's not placebo and it's simply because the delay between when the frame is ready and when it is shown will be shorter at 60Hz than at 40Hz. Technically the longest it could have to wait at 60Hz is 1/60s=16ms, while at 40Hz it's 1/40s=25ms. That's enough of a difference to be noticeable. If you enable allow tearing and you mostly care about what's in the middle of the screen (in a FPS for example), then that should cut that delay in half but 60Hz would still be better.

However 40FPS/60Hz won't give you a constant input delay and it won't look smooth, that's why people recommend 40FPS/40Hz instead.",SteamDeck
jhvzj5i,"
>limit the fps using an in-game setting 

Yeah, turning on VSYNC in game is the way to go",SteamDeck
jhw5che,"that's incorrect. if your game is running, say, at a solid 60 fps, and your refresh rate is 40 Hz, then the delay chain looks like this:

input -> up to 16 ms lag -> frame gets rendered -> between 0 and 8 ms lag -> frame gets displayed

this 0-8 ms lag is additional due to 40 Hz not lining up with 60 fps, and the fact that it's random makes it even worse because now the lag is random and this feels way crappier than longer lag that's always a fixed amount.",SteamDeck
jhvzvnw,"In-game vsync is always preferable, but I was referring to if you wanted to limit to less-than-refresh-rate. Such as wanting to cap to 30fps. If the game offers an in-engine way to cap to 30 that is *vastly* preferable to using the Steam os-level cap.",SteamDeck

jhxzwml,"It's not easy to do because you would have to go far out of your way to create a scenario where you have a 40hz screen refresh but a 60fps limit. When at 40hz the fps limiter changes from 15/30/60 to 10/20/40, meaning even if you leave the limiter on 60fps when you change to 40hz it'll automatically change to a 40fps. In order to get a 60fps limit you'd need to turn off the limiter, enable ""allow tearing"" to turn off the system vsync, then *also* turn off the game's own vsync, then use in-game settings to limit the fps to 60 (or turn off the limit).

I've also messed with my cloud save data (thought I wiped it for a moment there) and putting the system in offline mode to kill whatever it's trying to download, but no luck.

If it's unclear, you go to launch the game in game mode, it shows you the controller config it will be using, and then says ""downloading content 0%"" (I did try switching controller layouts in case it was somehow downloading one). 

Running in desktop mode makes it clear the ""downloading"" is for a game update because it opens a little window with the ""launch game when ready"" option. But, you go to downloads and nothing is there and it never budges from 0%.",SteamDeck

jhsay94,"Steam Deck is just a PC and PC always had the potential to be more adopted. The reason it wasn't is because PC in handheld form factor wasn't achieveable nor was it sought out. But most importantly; hardware companies sell CPUs and GPUs in massive bulks at low cost to Sony and Microsoft but sell equivalent parts at much higher price to DIY market. As result you're looking at minimum 500$ for a portable mini itx PC.

If all conditions were met, close to as cheap APUs for DIY as for consoles (e.g 15%  more expensive), you could build a mini itx APU build and it would be portable. It wouldn't kill consoles but it would be an amazing (open system; mods and emulation) and respectable (cost effective as consoles) gaming system.

There is also a misconception that because PC UI is somehow not user friendly because it's not as streamlined as a console. The fact is PC has mouse and keyboard and is easy to use with those. Consoles didn't or had limited K/M support, as result UI designers streamlined it, which is exactly why Deck has such UI too (for when you're using its controls not K/M).",SteamDeck

While I've had very few issues with Bluetooth controllers (especially on the Deck), it's the fastest solution that most people tend to be fine with and games will have zero problem recognizing with zero tweaks.

They aren't my favorite controllers for gameplay, but when you want to get a 4 player game rolling in seconds instead of several minutes, (and trust me, people do become impatient), just go with the easy route. Controllers and adapter will last you for years if you aren't particularly cruel to them, rechargeable batteries are easy to come by (just get the nice IKEA ones, they're within less than the margin of error for performance compared to Eneloops and they're a fraction of the price. The wall chargers they come with are great no-fuss chargers. As a backup I keep both a charger and a pack of dollar store alkaline batteries around in my bag as well).",SteamDeck

jhoqww3,"I've only tried the joycons with Yuzu so I can't say vouch for other games. Here's my experience:

The joycon initial pairing seems good at first but always have trouble pairing after SD go to sleep and wake up. I don't have this issue with my DS4 controller at all and it will reconnect 100% of the time. In split mode, it's a 50/50 chance to get the joycon to reconnect on wakeup and I have to fiddle with the sync button for a minute or two. It's random and unreliable.

During gameplay you MUST turn off all rumble feature. This can be a hassle since you might have to look into disabling it in both the SD menu and in the game menu to be sure. For some reason, the rumble data can oversaturate the Bluetooth bandwidth and cause signal to drop. Others have experience weak BT range but I haven't experience this issue so YMMV. Also, even with rumble off, the joycon battery still don't last more than 45m~1hr on a full charge and will cut short any long party/co-op game session.

The joycon driver on SD and Linux is useable but imperfect and is more or less an imitation of mapped inputs on the Switch ported over. Without an official driver from Nintendo or until someone comes out with a better driver, there will always be BT connection and signal issues so it's hard to recommend using joycon with SD unless you're an enthusiast.",SteamDeck

Without an official driver from Nintendo or until someone comes out with a better driver, there will always be BT connection and signal issues so it's hard to recommend using joycon with SD unless you're an enthusiast.

I've looked at the driver that's in the linux kernel, valve is using their own userspace implementation.  
The issue is, joycons expect perfectly timed bluetooth packets that tell them the 3d rumble pattern, which is in term used as a keepalive pattern, basically telling them to stay on and keep sending inputs.  
On the switch this driver (I'm guessing here) is running in a way that ensures that timing and prioritizes this. On linux this is way harder, since the bluetooth stack doesn't enforce this timing well enough, also the timeout when the kernel decides a controller has disconnected is far to long, so the controller and kernel sometimes have different opinions on the paring status, which will cause a re-pair (which would happen on the next button press on the controller) to just fall on it's face.  
Also the implementation of the controller numbering is fairly broken, so sometimes controllers can loose it's number when re-paring.  
  
I've thought about trying to rewrite the driver with the community knowledge on github, but I didn't quite get around to doing it (and don't have any linux driver dev knowledge lol).",SteamDeck

i understand windows to steam is a big change but really that’s that’s all in your mind, proton plays 99.9% of windows games natively and instantly via steam. 

you need to install proton GE on your steam deck and you’ll have ultimate comparability with all windows games. Only anti cheat games like fortnite don’t work and that’s more because of Tim Swennys micro penis than the steam decks hardware. 

Also you can always install windows on steam deck and it’ll probably work better than some chinese made handheld that’s had zero quality testing. these things are pumped out on a monthly basis, they’ll never compete with steam deck which took 10 years of laser focus to create",SteamDeck

jhqt5m9,Everyone missing the point that the OP is getting at here.

jhrqic2,"This is my only way to play Returnal and for me it has been a lot of fun without the hitches in performance impacting my ability to play well. I’ve been able to rank in the top 10 on the daily challenges while playing in handheld. I have over 20 hours in (the first 10 hours we’re figuring out how the game actually works) and I still haven’t beat biome 2 but that’s because those damn Severed eventually catch up to me. Not because of the frame rate. 

I can’t speak to what performance is like in the late game or tower gameplay, but my unpopular opinion based on my limited progress is it’s 100% worth the full price purchase depending on how valuable $60 is to you. 

You can take it very far with reconfiguring the game engine settings file and reduce the game to play on a potato and you can keep your average frame rate well above 30. I found keeping the factory low settings and 70% render scaling to be the best experience in either handheld or docked.",SteamDeck
jhrz8gk,"Looking at the other comments, I'm clearly in the minority, but I think it's worth it on the Deck. I didn't think I would enjoy this game at all at anything under 60 FPS, but I think I could sit down and play through the whole game on the Deck if I wanted to the way that it runs now, but I've also been locking every graphically-demanding game like this to 30 FPS on the Deck, so maybe I'm just used to that speed now. Valve does allow you to do refunds if you buy directly from the Steam store, so you could always pick it up, try it out, and get your money back if you don't like how it plays.",SteamDeck
jhrvzba,">is this at a playable and enjoyable state?

I'd say - no. Returnal, specifically, is all about fast reflexes and brutal, punishing combat. It does not lend itself well to a 30 FPS cap.",SteamDeck
jhr1mnb,"But it's well worth it!
Best game I've played this gen on ps5 imo.",SteamDeck
jhrrmbs,You didn't have your expectations set properly then. It runs at 1080p internal resolution on the PS5 lol,SteamDeck
jhsth88,"I mean... 16.6ms is not much of a difference. Your muscle memory adapts, and your eyes will adjust. 60fps is nice for games like this, but it's certainly not a requirement.",SteamDeck
jhsaydv,"although I agree that 60fps is incredible for this game, I still finished it at 30fps with dips even below that and have never played it on ps5 before. I also reached the soft end of sisyphus tower too. I'm an older gamer too, my reaction time is not what it used to be!

Optimal ? absolutely not. Doable and perfectly enjoyable ? 100% yes, it's my current GOTY",SteamDeck

jhry5sj,"It's unstable because OP didn't turn on VSync to lock it to 30fps. 

And the FPS drops are happening during the teleporting parts where the player isn't in control and the drops are only slight.",SteamDeck

jhsbwop,"I completed the game at >=30 fps, story and tower. It's 100% doable and I enjoyed it immensely. People saying it HAS to be 60 are exaggerating a tiny bit.

Is it better at 60? hell yes! I tried it on ps5 very recently and it was incredible. It does not in any way ruin the fun of playing it on the go",SteamDeck

ji0peg4,"Appreciate the reply dawg, I've wanted to play Returnal forever so I'm definitely gonna pick it up.",SteamDeck
jhsckq3,"i think it depends on each player's tolerance and/or frame rate sensitivity. As i said a few time in this thread. I completed the game in the span of a week at 30fps and sometimes less than that. FPS was never my problem. I reached the back half of the game during the first weekend and had never tried it prior. I went in blind.   


I am not affected by frame rate as much as other people do, maybe that's it... but it is 100% playable. If i did it, almost anybody can",SteamDeck
jhs34u2,Yeah but I wish it ran better on deck cuz the game seems great for it,SteamDeck
jhs6323,"Yes but those are obviously locked settings. On the PC I’m used to being able to turn things down to near potato graphics (plus tinier resolution) for better performance, not to mention the difficulty of optimization.

jhulcdo,"I can with chiaki4deck, 60fps.",SteamDeck
jhqfox8,"I just don't buy that, I'm sorry. TLoU was a train wreck on PC. Returnal is interesting because when I've seen gameplay I don't see anything that screams ""this game shouldn't run well"" and yet it still seems to demand quite a lot. Not sure why. Exclusivity doesn't mean much other than to suggest it requires some beefier hardware but I'm not seeing why. It just doesn't strike me as that taxing a game. Same with TLoU. It looks great but ultimately it's an adventure on rails with never too much happening on screen at any given time. And yet CPU and GPU going crazy. Maybe I'm just cynical, these games designed for 6 year old hardware don't run well unless you're on a PC from the last 3 years or so.",SteamDeck
jhryues,"VSync was on in the in-game settings.

EDIT: I must apologize, the in-game VSync was in fact off, because that's the only way to limit the framerate in the game settings. You are correct, though, the only time I saw any noticeable frame rate drops was when there was a scene transition.",SteamDeck
jhs8pyp,There is also micro stutter in this video,SteamDeck
jhtfz0r,"Okay, excellent, thank you, I'll try that later today.

EDIT: Okay, so, this did actually give me a more stable frame rate, but it introduced pretty noticeable input lag.",SteamDeck
jhsc6gb,"I agree 100%. It's obviously going to feel better on my desktop, but the fact that I can get essentially a PS5 game to play on PS4-level hardware and have it feel good enough to still have fun is incredible to me.",SteamDeck
ji1ium8,"Yeah, I think it's worth it. One note, though: Unless I'm going nuts, I think the latest update (the one that added DLSS 3 for desktop Nvidia cards) actually made it play worse on the Deck than the version that was live a couple of days ago, so you might have to adjust settings accordingly.",SteamDeck
jhsef8b,">I am not affected by frame rate as much as other people do, maybe that's it... but it is 100% playable. If i did it, almost anybody can

You certainly raise a good point. I usually don't *really* mind a perfect 30 FPS cap, especially for third-person games, but I genuinely found Returnal unplayable on my end. Kudos to you for wrapping it up at 30, though!",SteamDeck
jhs90is,My logic still applies ironically lol. The PS5 can run doom eternal at 120fps. So you shouldn't expect better than 60 on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhtbo5k,"Lmao, that got a good laugh out of me. I was born early 80s so yeah. You’re absolutely right ;)",SteamDeck
jhqhiso,">Same with TLoU. It looks great but ultimately it's an adventure on rails with never too much happening on screen at any given time. 

Having played TLOU on an i9-13900KS/4090 system max 4k settings, it's pretty freaking impressive looking, way better I think than Returnal at the same settings.

Again, my point was that these two PS 5 only games didn't seem to port well. haven't ported well for mid and lower speced system. Returnal's PC hardware requirements draw a lot of attention because they seemed high to a lot of people.",SteamDeck
jhqsvfe,Well one thing that has happened is that Nvidia in their totally consumer wisdom made sure that all of their cards have very little RAM compared to AMD cards. Hardware Unboxed just did a video proving that if the 3070 had more VRAM it wouldn't be struggling so much with new games. They used a quadro equivalent card that even has lower clock speeds but has 16GB of RAM and it was a huge difference. So the company that everyone buys is artificially limiting your performance. Thanks Nvidia!,SteamDeck
jhr9lrq,"I totally agree. Remember TLOU was actually a PS3 game & both the PS4 revised AND the new PS5 TLOUpt1 which is ""built from the ground up"" has the exact same issues & bugs that the original game had albeit with better graphics. I have all 3 versions.

Sad to say but PC versions are not as good as the original versions even though played on far more powerful hardware in comparison to PS4.",SteamDeck
jhsk5gw,Is it any better with vsync off in game and using the Decks own limiter?,SteamDeck
ji2d335,So just use the update before the DLSS 3 one?,SteamDeck
jhsa7qz,I see. Even so is it wrong to hope for better?,SteamDeck
jhuxttd,"Early 80s? Ha! Your not old, man. You just have the perspective that most of us 80s kids do, remembering it was a rare event when 3D games ran at solid 30. (Ocarina running at 20)",SteamDeck
jhqsye3,It's mostly a VRAM issue for Nvidia cards that only have 8 or lower in RAM.,SteamDeck
jhsq5yh,"They haven't scaled well to lower hardware, no. But consider that thought. You've got a few grands worth of PC parts in just GPU and CPU. These are PS5 games, but the hardware you're rocking represents massive generational leaps in performance over what's in the PS5. It's fairly well reported that comparable hardware doesn't get close to even PS5 performance. 2070s/80s struggling to match PS5 visuals in TLoU. These games, by their nature, should scale well considering they were designed with 5 year old hardware in mind. It's not exactly like the PS5 was cutting edge at the time of release. These are bad ports, not just on lower end hardware. 4090s can run the game, from what I've seen, at native 4k, no upscaling while swallowing up north of 18gb of vram and >20gb of system memory. These games were designed for systems with far less impressive system resources. This isn't a case of poor performance on the lower end, that's poor performance at all price points.",SteamDeck
jhsk9ix,"I'm not sure about that, but I can try it and let you know.

EDIT: It seems like the frame rate did actually stabilize even more doing this, but it added a pretty noticeable lag to the controls.",SteamDeck
ji2et7d,"Yeah, that's the one that worked really well on the Deck for me, and you obviously don't need DLSS 3 on the Deck, anyway. I don't think that update added anything gameplay wise. I believe it should be manifest 9040347422599518007 on SteamDB.",SteamDeck
jhsqtzl,I've watched a few videos of 6950s playing the game at 100fps but at 1080 while still utilizing 13gb. That still seems nuts for 1080.,SteamDeck
jhsu0ow,"I get what you are saying but the PS 5 has specialized hardware for decompressing textures, the GPU streaming DirectStorage like capability that isn't employed on the PC for this game plus whatever else the game uses that's tied to the PS 5 hardware.

Consoles have long been accused of holding PCs back. We've just hit a spot with where they actually are kind of pushing the ahead. Like the issue with 8 GB cards particularly ones from nVidia that are being held back by lack of VRAM.

And we are seeing more and more games do this. PCs just need more resources to keep up at the mid-range in particular. Call it unoptimized, bad porting, etc. but almost all of these AAAs need more than just couple of years ago.  

&#x200B;

> 4090s can run the game, from what I've seen, at native 4k, no upscaling while swallowing up north of 18gb of vram and >20gb of system memory.  These games were designed for systems with far less impressive system resources.   

True, and they can't touch something like an i9-13900KS/4090 setup either at 4k. Throw in DLSS upscaling, a tech only on PCs with nVidia hardware, and they blow console performance away with well over 100 FPS 4k max settings. Upscaled but DLSS quality is so good it hardly matters visually, it's just something a console can't do.

Yes, that's a lot of hardware to brute force through the issues, but that's kind of what high-end PC gaming has been about.",SteamDeck

jhvsddi,"I'd remove the back buttons. Ultimately the back buttons are just that, four extra buttons. I can use either trackpad as much more than four extra buttons. I recognize that the back buttons let you hit an extra button while keeping a finger on a stick, but I think that's less powerful compared to all of the cool things the trackpads can do.",SteamDeck
jhvpo17,Trackpads. The back grip buttons are so helpful as shortcuts.,SteamDeck
jhw1xxj,"Hardly a game where I don't have 2-3 back buttons assigned, those are very helpful to me.

The trackpads on the other hand... I mostly deactivate them as I keep accidentally touching them with the palm of my hand and thus keep getting false inputs because of them.",SteamDeck
jhvqrj7,I play RTS games and use Desktop mode way too much to get rid of the trackpads. the joystick is not even comparable,SteamDeck
jhvu3pj,"I'd remove the trackpads I guess. I use the backbuttons as my ABXY (which is why those would actually be my choice to remove).   
The trackpads are just so useful but I mostly use it for swifter menu control. Which is more a convenience then a requirement.",SteamDeck
jhvxs0t,"The Steam Deck would be basically useless for me if the trackpads didn't exist, because if there's a way to make the joysticks actually work well as a mouse I haven't found it yet, and most of my games need a mouse.

And I like using them in general as they're more comfortable to reach with my hands.

In turn, I rarely use the back buttons because I have to sort of awkwardly hit them with the side of my finger due to how things line up and it never works well.",SteamDeck
jhw125u,"Neither. As someone who uses emulators on the Steam Deck, both have their uses.",SteamDeck

jhvzx66,Uhh volume buttons? To be honest I found both to be really useful as I try to play my games first with the trackpad specifically if fps. If it wasn’t smooth then the joystick.,SteamDeck
jhw0gvi,"Tough choice but I would definitely remove the back buttons. The trackpads are irreplaceable as a superior method of aiming and cursor control compared to the stick. Gyro synergizes well with the trackpad, but can't quite replace it IMO.

With mode-shifting and a click-activated button menu, you can actually assign a different input for the center and each corner of the trackpad. I tested this in Ion Fury and it worked well without any accidental unintended corner presses. I plan on doing a little video tutorial on it soon. Granted, I used it for weapon selection and not common actions like jumping. Still, it could reasonably make up for the lost back paddles.

With the Steam Controller, this works even better due to the larger trackpad size. In fact, I pretty much stole this idea from known Steam Controller master RambleCan.",SteamDeck
jhw2di2,"I’ve had it for two months and I’ve never used the back buttons. I’m not huge on the trackpads either but those are useful for navigating the occasional stubborn mouse-only menu at least.

Edit: I did notice Death Stranding came with an official controller config that actually mapped the back buttons to do stuff so maybe I’ll change my mind once I get into that. I’m just not the type to go looking around for stuff to map myself.",SteamDeck
jhw3vds,"I hope they leave the trackpads alone, it’s one of my fav features;  I haven’t used the back buttons at all.",SteamDeck
jhw8l9u,i'd remove the sticks and make the trackpads bigger and round,SteamDeck
jhw8yto,"I use the trackpads more than the joysticks so removing them isn't an option. I actually have the right trackpad set to both mouse and four buttons by using a directional pad with an inverted outer ring binding to apply a action set layer which changes it to a mouse. I do the same to the left which changes it to a joystick (or WASD depending on the game).

I do use the back buttons but I could cope without them. Especially if dual stage triggers were brought back.",SteamDeck

For games where there's a dodge (like souls games), having that on a back button is super helpful, along with swap weapon/spell",SteamDeck

OP, I know you're more angry at yourself for not checking the device worked before you went to an area without internet. 

But this is a steam games machine. The ""desktop mode"" part is adjacent to the main event. I'm sure many many people (reddit is not a good sample) never go into desktop mode. 

""Never recommend it to anyone who isn't a techie""?

That's absurd. 

It filters games in the store that are Steam verified. 
I've not had a verified game that doesn't play great. 
Click download, play, and enjoy.",SteamDeck

jhxd15y,">I'd never recomend it to anyone besides techies

Ridiculous. This thing is entirely marketed as a handheld gaming device, and it works perfectly fine out of the box. My wife, opposite of a techie, uses hers almost daily and hasn't once needed to ask for my help.

It's not a black mark against the Deck that you were unprepared to use the device in a manner for which it wasn't intended.",SteamDeck
jhxcut5,">Every OS I've ever used for general computing has had a video player since \~windows xp, so I didn't really think of it.

Yeah, that's kind of a thing with Linux. A lot of distros won't play h264 out of the box since it's proprietary so you either have to install the decoders afterwards or get one that embeds them like VLC.

I think a lot of the ""gotchas"" that people are experiencing are like that.

And to be fair to Linux, I still remember having to download the K-Lite Codec Pack back in the Windows XP days. ;)",SteamDeck
jhxcud7,"This is just my opinion but it doesn’t seem fair to not recommend it because you had issues doing something that would be considered a niche use. Most people would just play games and that’s it. Also, was it just the one issue?

Again, just my opinion.",SteamDeck
jhxcz45,"I think the moment you open the desktop, you’re getting added functionality, not the main intended use.

jhxqx1k,"I can't be too mad at myself, I'd just driven several hours and had a long day prior to that. Double checking that my device came with a video player wasn't exactly at the top of my priority list. 

Part of that last bit was due to other issues I've had, even in gaming mode/verified games. Not nearly as many as in desktop mode, but enough to make it feel like a product that never left the beta testing phase. Most of them have been related to text scaling, textures, and bounding boxes weirdly enough. A lot of it can be fixed with tweaking proton settings, but it's annoying having to close and restart when you're in the middle of things. Other issues I've had (in general) were no sound (at all), display scaling issues after plugging into a display, and problems charging. This device just feels like it's been cursed with Murphy's Law. At this point, based on my experience, I wouldn't recomend it because I've had to do a lot of troubleshooting. Even for non-niche use cases.",SteamDeck
jhxlcar,"I'd argue that the ability to play videos is a pretty standard feature in 2023. The xbox can play video, but it's sold as a gaming device as well.

jhxjs3s,"Even in games, I've had really bad luck. GTA V used to run well. Then the criminal enterprises update dropped and completely broke it for me. Now, there are asset streaming and LoD issues. It's like the whole LoD system gives up after 5-10 mins. When that happens, you either have to stay in the area that's loaded, or close and re-open the game. I also could not get minecraft bedrock edition to work for the life of me. I spent a good few hours hopping between the terminal and various forums. Space engineers (the only game I've spent any significant amount of time playing in the past few years) just doesn't work at all. Supported games are fun, but I've already played most of the ones I'm interested in, and don't want to spend a lot on games moving forward. Even then, they can have weird issues that I have no idea how to solve. A reboot often fixes it, but it's still annoying for a product marketed at consumers. It feels like a product at the tail end of a beta test IMO. It's *almost* great but there are a plethora of little things which hold it back. Desktop mode keyboard sucks, using it with an external display is a pain in the ass (both of which are 'normal' use cases, some games don't work in big picture mode, some people dock it when gaming at home). Even the xbox has a video player if I recall correctly, it's not a huge stretch to expect it. Most linux distros I've used in the past come bundled with basic software.",SteamDeck

I made a few posts about other issues I was having along the way (desktop mode keyboard issues, charging issues, display issues, browser crashing issues, just to name a few, sound issues.

Installed stock Windows 11 Pro, I think debloaters cause more problems that they solve. Installed the AMD APU drivers and the other stuff from Valve. Installed Steam Deck Tools.  Since then, I updated the APU drivers from March. 

It's worked very well, and there are a number of YouTubers that agree. I don't try to run new AAAs on it, that's why I have a powerful gaming rig. The Deck just doesn't have the hardware, be it SteamOS or Windows, especially with the high demand for some of these games. But I currently have about 70 games on mine, mostly lighter games but I do play MK 11 on it and it runs fine, right at 60 FPS for whatever settings I'm using. Sackboy is another, nice game for this device.",SteamDeck

jhxlxe2,"It's not, but it's the experience I've had. As a consumer, it's a frustrating experience. Sometimes updates can just completely break the game and you're SoL until the developer decides they want to support steam deck users.

jhy8uxr,"I mean I saw the post where you had the snippet about it being used as a computer, but Xbox marketed the Xbox one as a media console and it didn't have a video player so its a very similar situation except that Xbox put a heavy focus on it and Valve had it as more of a side note.

But that's kind of irrelevant insofar as that first bit there...

Being a ""steam fan"" has nothing to do with my understanding of Linux and how it works. That's just the reality of the OS; it's something I have followed personally and professionally for 20+ years now.

Some developers choose to keep linux compatibility closed on anti-cheat software largely because it cannot get it's hooks deep into the operating system like it does with Windows; making it much easier to circumvent.

They are left with two options; enable linux for an extremely marginal playerbase and get very little profit for it and deal with the increased costs of dealing with the cheaters (both in terms of man hours and in terms of relations with their clients) or keep linux disabled and still retain 99.5% of their marketshare.

It is a business decision not a preference one.

Your expectation of the 512gb model is simply that... an expectation. They never advertised it as coming with windows so there's no reasonable expectation for that.

You are correct in that pricing and features of the deck has nothing to do with the devs... That's not relevant to compatibility.

Your commentary on Valve caring about running things from their store is misplaced and misguided. 

Valve already has a near monopoly for PC gaming on windows, that's not why they chose to ship with SteamOS.

I speculate it has more to do with the costs of licenses that would get passed on to consumers plus shipping with windows means additional paperwork as they have to include Microsoft in all of their distribution plans.

jhv8shd,"I mean, there's nothing preventing you from taking that cord and just taping it to the back of your deck for stability if that's your concern.

Though, have you considered just using the dock you already have and getting a cheap, possibly used, controller instead? Trying to game with a deck + dock on your belly seems like it would be unwieldy. It sounds like you want to game on a TV, you already have a dock, a cheap xbox controller would give you similar buttons to the Deck while letting you use it docked without having to drive yourself crazy with extension cords.

Alternatively you could go with a right angle adapter or one of those 180 back adapters. The problem with right angle adapters isn't that they're angled per se, it's that they are another middleman in between the power supply and the Deck, and you can't be sure that said middleman meets USB-PD standards and knows how to negotiate power properly. If you get a decent one you should be fine.

I mean, the official Dock has a right angle adapter integrated into it, so if there was a problem with the angle Valve surely wouldn't have made that design decision.",SteamDeck

You can manage to run demanding games for around 2~2:30 hours generally.

It is interesting to hear about lack of portability compared to the Switch though. I don’t honestly see the difference in portability.",SteamDeck
jhy57o3,"I waited before I bought the SD, but did not for Switch. 

Switch joycon is weak especially the thumbstick and I fix it myself. I go the 1st gen first release Switch and mine was a little warped with drifting. 

SD, I did not experience any even after I open it up and switch the SSD. I feel comfortable with the SD thumbstick over Switch. Actually their Switch-lite feels better than the orig first release Switch.

I never find the appeal for OLED so without it don't bother me.

I don't play multiplayer and if I want to play AAA, I'll either play them on my desktop or console. 

I actually hooked up the battery while gaming and I have not charge the SD since the first charge only charge the battery bank. ( I also have a few powerbank as of now, I have not run out of battery yet cos while 1 charging, I can just hooked up another one. )

for $400 ( only paid extra $60 for the 512 gb ssd and I have a lot of the SD card already due to tablets. I don't see myself having tons of games downloaded and I delete games once I am done ), I also get the hard casing for protection, I already felt it's worth. 

So overall for me, it is a good experience.",SteamDeck
jhyfjzc,"This highlights how different people's perceptions can be. When I got my steam deck i was skeptical of if it could replace my gaming PC with much better specs. However, after getting it for the past 2 months I have not played a single game on my PC and have had no desire to. I have played AAA games from Days gone to Spider-Man remastered as well as Hogwarts legacy, all of which ran acceptably well where if I didn't have the FPS counter on I wouldn't even know what FPS it was running at.

 I take this thing everywhere with me when I go somewhere. I know I'm going to be away from the house for an hour. I take it with me. I take it on walks and sit on a park bench for an hour while playing it looking over a lake. 

The battery life honestly amazes me sure out of the box you're going to get an hour and a half on most AAA games. Haven't seen lower than that myself and if you were to fiddle with it I was able to get both days gone and Spider-Man remastered to last 3 and 1/2 to 4 hours on a full charge locked to 30fps. On lighter games like vampire survivors I can push it to 8 hours.

 Perception is key and it's really hard to know how much you're going to like something or how much somethings going to bother you without trying it yourself. You could be like this person who's found fault in very many aspects of the steam deck. Or you could think wow, this is an amazing machine and I can't believe it exists.",SteamDeck
jhykdf5,Okay,SteamDeck
jhy2lfi,"I was reading your points and I agree somewhat:

The deck is not totally portable, it’s a bit unwieldy, I ended up buying a small stand to take some of the pressure off my hands while playing games. The case does not help its “heft” as its bulky, adding more bulk to the unit. It is a gaming unit, so i kinda get the weight behind it, but i am glad I purchased the stand.

Games seem to run okay for me (mostly), but getting to play them seems to be a bit of a challenge. I spend more time updating them, than actually playing them sometimes.

The constant patches/shader caches/optimisation updates seem to be nearly every day. It also doesn’t seem to like you copying games via the steam deck from another pc. On several occasions. (backed up on ssd). I have copied the entire game and yet Steam claims there is like 15gb missing and then proceeds to download them. If that were the case then my games on pc would have the same issue. On some games, it refuses to acknowledge they are even installed, but this bug seems pretty rare fortunately.

I found the screen to be okay for small play throughs, but I think I am so used to large play areas, it starts to grate on me after a while. I just end up plugging it back in to its dock.  I did like the touch screen aspect, but i found the linux interface a little lacking.

Battery Life was okay for me, it wasn’t super great, but I could play for around two hours on standard settings. I still had battery left too.

I never bothered with all the hype, They had so many preview restrictions for people to review the decks, it simply put me off till it had been available for a year before even thinking of purchasing it.

In terms of games, I havent really explored beyond the basic game setup, there are some glitches setting up some games, like the xbox sign in screen not appearing properly on the steam deck, (like it was almost impossible to sign in to play forza). But so far the games I have tried 3/5 have worked okay.

In terms of price, the unit for me is way overpriced, there simply is not enough storage for the unit unless you play minor games. Most A rated games now seem to end up around 100gb. I ended up upgrading the unit to 2tb to be able just to play my current setup in portable mode. Having to upgrade the unit so quickly after purchase was not something I had envisioned happening. (I upgraded it just fine, I had zero issues doing the on hands stuff. I had more issues with the actual steam recovery usb key. It is provided as is and is really buggy. it took three attempts to get to install properly and then it refused to update with another well known bug coming up (seems the wifi cards on some of these decks is really nasty)

I found the design to be okay, glad they put the vents up the top. Bulky but okay.

I found the deck also underwhelming due to its lack of storage and the steam OS issues. I had hoped this would be the portable gaming platform I was looking for, but It wasn’t so I replaced it with something that gave me the best of both worlds. In terms of whats next, the Rog Ally will work with my existing setup, so I am waiting for the reviews and pricing on that unit. It has similar specs, but the gpu passthrough makes it an interesting choice for serious portable gaming. (you get the best of both worlds).

That is how I found the unit, why i switched to something else.",SteamDeck

jhyq3ss,"Okay, I guess? Whatever floats your boat. I do not agree even on one single point. I just do not understand your arguments at all, because these are just not arguments for or against the Steam Deck at all.

I sold my Switch and got a Deck. Best decision ever. I use my Steam Deck EVERY SINGLE DAY for a few hours. Whereas my Switch would collect dust for months. I would only use it if a new game came out. Sometimes even half a year.",SteamDeck
jhyq4yj,"The Steam Deck is a tinkerer's device and everyone imagining it's a portable PS4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch Pro is just setting themselves up for disappointment. It's a PC. PC gaming requires a certain amount of tinkering and the more advanced the title the more true this becomes.

But the Deck's definitely portable. I'd argue anyone dismissing the ergonomics while talking up a Switch is being disingenuous.",SteamDeck
jhyqxlk,"Not portable?

That’s not some massive backpack either. It’s a [small fashionable sling bag](https://www.amazon.com/Dwenles-Crossbody-Waterproof-Daypack-Charging/dp/B09XQJDX61). And you can even see my chunky power bank and folding BT keyboard in there.

I don’t agree on the ergonomics. I find the deck to be very good. From where you grip rests, it fills your palms and you don’t have to adjust your grip to reach anything but the overlay buttons, even the trackpads. And I use the trackpads ALOT; for any game UI/navigation *(right trackpad)* as well as mapping the left trackpad as 4-way buttons and assigning extra functions.

jhyy5o6,"I honestly disagree with everything you just listed. I find it to be just as portable as the Switch. I can run AAA games if I want without many issues and I have an at home console if something doesn’t work as most people also do. The screen for me is fantastic and I have no complaints with it. Battery life is honestly about the same as the Switch especially if you lower the FPS and refresh which in my experience doesn’t mess with gameplay noticeably. For me $549 for a portable device with the ability to play lots of PC games without having to spend $2,000 on a gaming PC was more than well worth it. And lastly as far as hype and expectations go maybe people should just research first. It has far exceeded my expectations and when it first came out I completely ignored it. I didn’t order one until there were enough games I couldn’t get on console that I wanted to play. Plus add in the constant game sales and honestly I feel it’s a very good choice.",SteamDeck

jhz5ccp,"So here's my two cents. The old lid switch is garbage, it's old tech with a shiny new label on it.   

The steam deck while being old tech can run AAA games. Portability isn't about raw power if you want that just go get a fucking laptop with a 4080. That's even less portable but it'll play what you want but not without plugging in. 

Buy a battery for the SD it makes it infinitely more portable than a laptop especially while traveling. I live on the road 6 days a week and I can't always pop out my laptop but I can always pull out the steam deck I have a bag just for it and it's supplies I even have a nice little cable and a battery and I can play all day long almost 10 hours with a 25,000 ml amp battery.  

I myself have modded the crap out of my SD. Better joysticks( hall effect), better cooling, a better battery(an external 25,000 milliamp) , a snap-on fan with a stand, a nice dock so I can use it on the TV, and a Logitech k40 so I have a mouse and keyboard if I want to play faster than light.",SteamDeck
jhzdvw0,Fair enough.,SteamDeck
jhzgaom,I too wish it was more powerful.. and battery life is meh at best. It’s a great entry to pc type gaming on the go though. I will be picking up an Ally when they come out though.,SteamDeck

They are both just as portable since you'd want to put it in a protective case anyways (Deck comes with one, conveniently) so what dot are you connecting that I'm not seeing?

The SD does emulation up to Wii U and ps2 with some ps3. The ally will probably handle ps3 and yuzu better. But aside from that. The SD and the ally will be about the same for emulation. It's not like NDS games are going to work any better on either of them. You might be able to upscale a bit more on the ally, but in my experience, it just doesn't matter. 

Don't forget to add the price of an SD card into the equation too. A 1tb isn't negligible when deciding between the two. You might not need a card with the ally. 

The SD is an emulation beast. 

I currently have a 64gb SD with a 512 GB SD card with batocera installed. It works great. Ive been nothing but happy with the performance. I only wish I would've gotten a 1tb card. My entire collection is about 650gb, so it kinda sucks to just have a few missing.

A few Japanese exclusive Gameboy color ways, a couple Japanese retailer exclusive GBA SP colors. I wish I didn't have to sell it all but as a married father bringing home our homes sole income trying to keep my wife and babies afloat, along with a few unforeseen circumstances like missing work due to a suicide in the family, being forced to miss work without pay BY MY JOB because I *may have* been exposed to somebody with covid at work, car trouble etc you name it etc eventually I was left with zero other options.

jhnk9gq,I don’t think they should be compared together? One is a powerful handheld PC the other is a pure handheld. Vita may be a failure of Sony but the homebrew community is awesome! You don’t really need a specific memcard anymore and there is a lot of things you can do like I was streaming from steamdeck via moonlight. And it is not that hard to set up nowadays deckwise you just need to install sunshine_x86_64.flatpak and follow some instructions you will be fine. If you want to stream on vita make sure you have forced software encoding in sunshine settings.,SteamDeck
jhnn9bg,They are! Sunshine is basically build for Moonlight,SteamDeck
jhz792l,"They are. One program *casts* the screen (like the sun casts its rays), the other program *reflects* that screen on a different device (like the moon reflects the sun's rays). I wasn't aware that you could get Moonlight on a Vita though. Guess the homebrew scene really is pretty solid.

I've only heard of people installing Sunshine on a powerful desktop PC and Moonlight on the Steam Deck, for playing things like Elden Ring at 60fps. Apparently Sunshine+Moonlight work better than Steam's own Remote Play, in a lot of cases.

Now I want to install Sunshine on my Deck and moonlight on my Chromebook (I just looked, there is a ChromeOS version) so I can play more games that make heavy use of the keyboard!

jhwp8ld,"Generally I agree with you, but I like playing older PC games too, and quite a few from the late 2000s don't play well with a horizontal resolution of 1280, expecting 1366x768 or better. I do like the 16:10 ratio, and understand why lower resolutions lead to better performance in general, but personally I'd like to replace that 1280x800 display with a 1440x900 one for the sake of compatibility with those older games. The 26% increase in pixels wouldn't be nearly as taxing for the GPU as trying to drive a full 1080p display, but still gets the horizontal rez up over 1366.

Also, while OLED would be amazing, I think they could get away with just an IPS screen that has better color accuracy, vibrance, and peak brightness than the terrible panel they have now (hopefully with good min brightness as well, though that's less important to me than to others). And probably one built for horizontal use, again for the sake of compatibility with certain software. Bonus points if they can give it variable refresh instead of fixed.",SteamDeck

Not officially, no, but it may be in the works as part of [this update](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Color-Steam-Deck), when it eventually rolls out to users.

In the meantime, you can [Generate a LUT](https://blog.checkyo.tech/2022/06/20/steam-deck-display-calibration/) yourself and apply it to games using [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) or [vkBasalt](https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt), but it doesn't apply to the system as a whole, takes a bit of work to use with each game, and there are certain games that won't work with it at all (rendering OpenGL games through [Zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html) might help, but there are still gaps in its coverage afaik). All that effort is not for the faint of heart, lol.

Alternatively, VibrantDeck can be set to control the red, green, and blue saturation values separately. Bumping the red and green up more than the blue might suffice for some people.",SteamDeck

But for older games and indie games - where the Steam Deck really shines, at least for me - the Steam Deck can handle those easily at 1080p60.

So, if we bring the deck into this, which do we compare to the deck since both ps4s are the same console? Now let’s take resolution back into account while still pretending that the deck performs similarly. Which console does it make sense to compare the deck to, the one that runs at double its resolution, or the one that runs at octuple its resolution? The answer is obvious, the ps4, because its resolution is closer to the deck (we’re still pretending they perform the same at their respective resolutions). So, even if we pretend they perform the same at their respective resolutions, it is misleading at the very least to compare the deck to the pro, when performance is more comparable to the base ps4 because the resolutions are closer there.

“Context be damned”

Debate over, you’re making yourself look stupid now.",SteamDeck
jhxetwt,"You keep saying that the steam deck has better 1080p performance than the base ps4 but now it has better relative performance?? I also googled the tflops of the steam deck and ps4 and the ps4 has more. As I said earlier, I never said the deck CAN'T perform better, it does have a better cpu. I'm saying that the deck is not ALWAYS more powerful, like you keep saying ""the steam deck is outright better than the ps4"" when it literally is not, the ps4 just has more gpu power, not even you can deny that. And don't tell me it's ALWAYS being cpu bottlenecked. That is game specific and sony would never waste money making a gpu that is always wasted on a weak cpu, consoles are sold at a loss after all.",SteamDeck
jhxg4ux,"If you can't agree with that then I'm done wasting time on someone this deluded, who avoids my questions.",SteamDeck
jhxhzvv,"You’re an idiot.

Relative performance to ps4 PRO, the PRO. 

Tflops don’t matter as the steamdeck has a far better cpu, more modern architecture and with far more features compared to the base ps4. 

I understand you’re problem now. You lack basic computer knowledge.

Also it gets more fps at the same settings which I already said.",SteamDeck
jhxj90t,"The stats speak for themselves bucko.

Also another game that the deck performs better than the base ps4 on at 1080p

Dying light. The ps4 also uses lower texture quality than the deck at that game.

It’s game over.

You don’t understand bottle necking.

I have already said my computer is better at 1440p than 1080p for this reason.

“I’m done wasting my time on someone this deluded”",SteamDeck
jhxkeyr,"You never said against the pro, and thats not what you said in your first comment. would you read what i have to say or just answer my questions? thats not much to ask. if i cared enough, i would explain my comment again because it doesn't look like you read it, you're saying what i said, the deck has a better cpu, i know. This does not always mean better performance, for the millionth time. I'm not responding again, you're too stupid to understand basic game and hardware logic",SteamDeck
jhxlh34,"I said:

“It’s comparable to the pro when factoring in the reduced resolution target”

Maybe you didn’t see it.

Then you made another comment that said the base ps4 is stronger than the deck, which I said it isn’t.

You’re the one too stupid here. It doesn’t matter if the gpu is better, if the cpu is holding it back enough that the steamdeck can overcome it by not bottlenecking it’s own gpu.

Extract Sacrosanct into the Mods folder, so the path should be Skyrim/Mods/Sacrosanct. 

For the bat transformation one, depends on if it needs SKSE or not. Sacrosanct doesn’t so the above is enough, but if that other mod needs SKSE, all I can say is people have gotten it working but I am not one of them.

Zen 4 cores should be vastly superior to the Zen 2 cores in the Deck, even at the same power target. This means vastly improved CPU performance and/or superior efficiency, leaving more of the power budget to the GPU. So while some of the numbers out there might be at 30 watts TDP, even at the same 15 watts as the Steam Deck, the Z1 (Extreme) should handily outperform it, especially in CPU performance.

The screen of the Ally is also just objectively superior. Yeah, technically a higher resolution screen uses more power (everything else being equal), but it won't be a battery killer. We've had >= 1080p screens in smartphones for years. Running games in 1080p obviously requires more power than running them in 720p/800p, but the great thing is that you don't have to. You can run demanding titles at a lower resolution and then upscale using FSR or the game's internal upscaler, resulting in super sharp HUD/2D elements, with only the 3D scene being upscaled. 120 Hz is also great, even if you won't run many games at frame rates close to 120. It seems to have adaptive sync, which is very nice and it being 120 Hz gives it a big operating range.

Windows might have more stuff going on in the background, but it's not that big of a resource hog as some people make it out to be. People are using ultra-thin ""business notebooks"" all day on battery running Windows just fine. And it's not like Windows is actively trying its hardest to slow your game down. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see official SteamOS support for the Ally, but that's more because of the overall out-of-the-box experience, not because SteamOS is oh-so lightweight.

jhqcr4l,"\~50% more speed at *2x the TDP* isn't nearly as impressive as the hype engine was implying. In a handheld expected to operate off a battery at any point, a 30w TDP is a pretty massive limitation.  

Remember, the Deck runs at 15w TDP and one of the biggest complaints about it is that its battery doesn't give you much playtime at that level. 50% more performance at twice the TDP for the normal chip is... Rough, given that these are handhelds we're talking about. 

I mean, it's neat and all, but when the Ally was first announced we were being told stuff like ""100-150% faster at 30w TDP, still \~50% faster at a 15w TDP like what the Deck uses."" 

Now we know that was for the high end and presumably super expensive extreme chip, not the one that's actually likely to be competitively priced with the Deck. That one isn't much better than the already existing high end handhelds which already struggle to compete with the Deck.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice improvement and I hope the next version of the Deck uses chips like these, but I see this as a splash of cold water on the Ally.

jho7bu1,">	How would you think it will be an upgrade?  It’s half the gpu cores.

Not necessarily a performance upgrade, but the base Z1 should match the Van Gogh APU in the steam deck from a gratis perspective. On the CPU side Z1 will utterly smash the deck (2-2.5x uplift).

2.8 TFLOPS from 4 RDNA3 CUs would indicate a clockspeed of roughly 2.8 GHz, a full 75% higher than the deck's 1.6 GHz limit. It's also RDNA3 which has been providing a roughly 15-20% uplift based solely on uArch improvements. Basically you're looking at twice the performance per CU which puts the base Z1 right in line with the Deck.

Whether you consider the hardware side of things an upgrade is up to you. Personally the loss of the trackpads, steam OS, and the ergonomic changes place it at more of a side-grade in my mind. With that said, 120hz with VRR would be extremely nice to have and the vastly improved performance for high end emulation would be sweet.

Edit: the Ally presumably has actual haptics rather than the deck's trackpads haptics providing rumble as well. That's a HUGE upgrade.",SteamDeck

And if something did, why would you sacrifice so much extra battery life to run at that? You know, the Deck's second big achilles heel: battery life.

Ultimately, on a handheld you need to strike a good balance between cost, performance, weight, ergonomics, size, heat, battery life,... And I don't feel like Asus is doing that. Everyone is dialing games down to 40 hz to get better graphics and battery life, and they come out with 120 hz. That's not how handhelds works. Just now they said they wanted to do VRR.

I was also pointing out, maybe poorly, that I don't see much need for more power on the deck for 720p/800p gaming.    Very, very little doesn't work on the deck for purely performance reasons as is.   Unless the scope changes to include bigger screens with higher resolutions or VR then the deck is actually at about the sweet spot for performance right now.

My point was that a fairly demanding game is getting 60fps stable on a fairly low power budget.  I imagine the new chips could be pushed a good deal farther at higher power budget if cooling was adequate.  

They’re thought is more along the lines of why the FPS isn’t 4x as much.  If deck gets 40fps shouldn’t this new chip with 4x teraflop be hitting like 160 fps?  And my reasoning is no, no it shouldn’t.  

Processor likely can’t handle high fps load and have both high gpu and high cpu loads within the power target.  Plus the displays are probably 60 fps making that the target frame rate.  

And games themselves fps doesn’t scale linearly unfortunately.",SteamDeck

Again, love my deck, just seems silly to paint it as a device it isn't.",SteamDeck
jhsyn0l,"No issue, but when I first looked at Proton DB it had some (some mini games would cause crashes, there was some crazy issues with hair rendering, etc). I didn't play it tell last December, so by the time I got it those had been ironed out, but everything I saw suggested it wasn't a game you wanted to play when the Deck launched. 

Each version of Proton improves things (mostly, since it sounds like 8 actually broke a number of games) but things only need to improve because things weren't working perfectly in the first place. Not an issue for me, but one of the reasons I wouldn't recommend a deck to a less tech savvy friend.",SteamDeck
jhozreq,"The mods I listed have one button press setup wizards for Windows.

By comparison, here's the workaround for getting CEP to work on Linux. The instructions are in the top rated response, not the original post:

So you can do all that....or on Windows you can just run the setup wizard. These were literally the first 5 games I tried and every one had an issue with the OS.

SteamOS is an adventure in checking ProtonDB for compatibility before you even buy the game, then searching that database for workarounds to the problem if one exists. According to ProtonDB itself, a full quarter of the top 100 steam games are Silver or below. Only 20% of the top 100 are platinum which means ""runs perfectly out of the box""",SteamDeck

jho009m,"Absolutely, just to name a few:

&#x200B;

* about 4-5 new driver APU versions for AMD since then.
* AMD Adrenalin software, utilizing color correction & saturation
* dual-boot on solid state drive instead of a poor-performing micro SD card
* utilizing Lossless Scaling for FSR
* SteamOS Fan curve
* Adjusting GPU and CPU Clocks
* Xbox and DS4 controller emulation support
* EqualizerAPO for better sound from the speakers
* Lots of tweaks/debloats to improve performance and battery life

You cannot have a flawless experience whether it's SteamOS or Windows. There is always bugs. There are reasons to use either OS, there isn't a ""better"" or ""best"" there is a ""best for you"".

Valve's lack of Windows support forces the community to find tweaks and create apps to streamline the experience as best as possible, but it's still janky from a UI standpoint.

I totally get that it might end up making it a poor experience for your use case, but I don't feel your framing is fair.

As far as ProtonDB ratings, once you account for native titles around 45 of the top 100 games should in theory work perfectly, but gold titles in my experience also usually work perfectly or, in the worst case, with very minor problems. This is especially the case for Steam Deck given that many titles are rated gold due to issues specific to certain hardware or OS installations, and the Steam Deck is a fixed configuration with Valve prioritizing fixes that affect it in particular. This also leads to many Verified titles (e.g. GTA V, CP 2077, Elden Ring) ending up with gold ratings on ProtonDB.",SteamDeck

I mock it, but i actually look forward to it. I plan on selling my custom pc build to get the top tier Ally and the 4090 egpu. It matches the performance of my 3090 desktop card, despite the fact that the proprietary link will add a bottleneck to the system.

When plugged in, the power used is much less of a concern so integrating the GPU in the power adapter is the logical next step.

ji3iwo6,"Update: I got the answer  


Answer: Yes you can Install Steam OS Via SD Card. You will want to flash a copy of the Steamdeck OS (Which can be downloaded directly from Steam's Website) by using Rufus.  


After Flashing the SD Card with the OS, plug the card into your Steamdeck. Then Hold down the volume up and press the power button. This will bring you to the boot menu.  


Select boot from file, then choose the SD Card.  


Once in the desktop of steam OS after booting from the SD Card, choose the ""Reimage"" option when installing to an empty drive.  


The rest is the same as the other guides out there. Just odd that their is not a single video showing that you can install from SD Cards... Especially if you have some already laying around like I did",SteamDeck

jhu6314,Delete the auto save state if you are using it,SteamDeck
jhwi844,"If you haven't used Retroarch so far, why not try deinstalling that? Although before that, i would just try reinstalling your standalone Citra Emulator exactly the way you did it originally, in case Retroarch somehow messed up its files - so basically that you would get to overwrite any changes that Retroarch might have done. I'd say start there, reinstall standalaone Citra, see if your game works. If not, deinstall Retroarch for now, see if it works then. If you still want to keep Retroarch it is still useful to try and deinstall temporarily, just to narrow the problem down.

&#x200B;

Maybe more importantly though - did you check if the *savefile* works on your Retroid or just the *game rom*? Because yeah, I'd assume your rom doesn't get bricked somehow, but your savefile might somehow. So that's important i think.",SteamDeck
jhu7rhc,Happen to know where those are? I've tried looking before posting but I can't find the right folder to empty.,SteamDeck
jhxrmvk,"Plan on keeping retroarch because it looks like it should be able to play sim ant really. 


I did find out what it was, I had to delete the shaders.

I found out the save state location and save location after going through the settings a bit more, however I also found out save states were off by default. 

After some filepath searching I noticed both citra and retroarch had a same file, opengl, which I found out after searching was shaders. Deleted both files, ran up citra, game booted up.

I think by running it on retroarch and through citra2018 rather than citra it ended up breaking the shaders or something which caused the problem.",SteamDeck

Happen to know of any other reasons it could be happening? Or possible fixes?",SteamDeck
jhujii1,"No, a corrupt savestate that is autoloading is the only thing that I know would cause this.",SteamDeck
jhujuxh,"You don't have an entry in the Directory menu for ""save states""? Are you sure? Maybe the makers of Emudeck have hidden it for some reason. Better contact the makers of  Emudeck and ask where those states are stored.",SteamDeck
jhuktiw,"I never got to a save part really. Just booted it up to see if it would even work. 

I had it on the standalone citra emulator, I believe it’s still there too. But for RetroArch, I haven’t actually saved yet. Not even state wise (I’m actually having trouble finding a way to even use save states in retroarch, or open up a emulator menu for button mapping or exiting emulation.) 

I’m probs just dumb and am overlooking the right file path by overthinking or something. They also did a update recently so maybe a update might help in having those folders, or options for",SteamDeck
jhuo5aa,"I am pretty sure Emudeck has auto save states and auto load states on by default so it doesn't matter if you get to a save to made a state, retroarch will create the state for you when you exit the game. You can find that state and delete it to eliminate it as a possibility.",SteamDeck
jhxt8go,"No clue on the auto save state part being default. I guess I must've somehow disabled auto saves because I ended up finding the setting options for saves, (locations too), and it was already off. 

It ended up being a shader problem, after looking through the hidden files and folders I ended up finding a folder named opengl in both citra and retroarch, after deleting both I was able to boot up the game without issue. Had to delete several other files but I think those were logs, they didn't seem to be needed for the emulators, and they would keep popping up after deleting. (I KNOW some were logs due to being in a folder named logs, others were in some other folder that had more to do with non essential game data itself rather than save functionality, as they would pop back up after attempting to start the game.)



Tldr
Got it fixed, it was a broken shader problem.

Thanks for the help though! Wouldn't have found a few file paths if you hadn't suggested a few things.",SteamDeck

Pop off the membranes on the boards corresponding to each button, clean both the membrane and the board underneath rubbing gently with a qtip imbued in isopropyl alcohol.

Second, your design seems to just have one straight arm with articulation at the base and mounting points. I've seen several gopro style arm mounts on this reddit and 3d print sites that have extra articulation elbows to accomodate different angles. I don't think I would buy a mount if there isn't at least 1 articulation elbow in the mid section.

Third, have you test if the design is able to reverse mount a phone below the SD? I think that's a use case many have not experiment with and can be a viable experience.

I found there is one specific kind of adapter that works heads and shoulders better than the rest, and that's the one I'm going to include in the kit.
2. Pretty similar comment for the extra articulation point. It adds some weight, and my research shows that 90-95% of customers only need the one degree of freedom. This is what's so cool about using the gopro standard, since if you find yourself in the 5-10% of customers that need more articulation, it's really easy to expand the system to fit your needs exactly.
3. The current design can mount below the Deck! (it's a bullet point in the image shown in the original post) All you have to do is unclip it from your deckmate and reclip it in the other orientation. (this is actually the way I use it most comfortably)

In the end there's not going to be a perfect mount for every single person, so I'm trying to design the most versatile version so people can customize it to their own desires!

The deck is probably one of the easiest things to run emulators in to be honest since it relies on a fantastic UI. 

I recommend the 64GB with an SD card if emulating is your primary goal. If you’re doing classic, ps1 and earlier, a smaller SD card will do just fine. If you want to do PS2, GameCube, ect, you’ll need a larger as card as the games can easily go over a GB. 

As for where to get Roms.. a Google search is your best friend. Don’t believe we’re allowed to link where to get them. But I can tell you, you do NOT need to buy an SD card preloaded. I highly recommend against it actually. 

TLDR; It’s super easy to set up the SteamDeck to be an emulator and will run most PS2 and GameCube games with ease and very little if any set up. My brother in law, who has never done emulation, was able to set up up with no questions. Super intuitive.",SteamDeck

I guess technically I have 1000s of roms, but I’m not using them. I transferred the roms over for any games I own and that’s the only ones I have on my anbernic. I think that may be the most daunting task for me at this point because I haven’t downloaded any roms either, the only ones I’m using are the ones that came with the device.

My biggest problem is there's some ghosting/double image that happens due to the optics. I only notice this on static images. So steams UI or load screens. I never notice it in game or watching a video. It does mean that using them as a monitor is far from ideal however productivity wise.

The second problem I have, is it's pretty hard to see the corners of the screen. This isn't always a problem, but it can be an issue if you end up playing something that throws tiny text in a corner.

* Go to desktop mode
* Download the game's iso (I got this from myabandonware)
* Download the 1.1 patch, there's a US and EU version depending on the iso you have, for me this was the EU one that is available on pcgamingwiki
* Open the iso from within the Dolphin file explorer and extract it's contents to a folder
* Install Lutris (you can get this from discover)
* Within Lutris:
   * Click the + button on the top left for ""add game""
   * Select ""install a windows game from media""
   * Give it a name (I just did Riddick)
   * Install
   * Change installation location if needed
   * When prompted for the setup file, browse to the folder you extracted the iso into and select ""setup.exe""
   * Let it run, which will start the games installer
   * Perform the install
   * When it is finished, close the installer and do not start the game yet
* In Dolphin
   * Move the exe for the patch into the same directory as Riddick.exe - you can find this path from Lutris if needed
* Back in Lutris
   * Highlight the game and go to the bottom bar where there is a wine menu you can expand
   * Click ""run EXE inside wine prefix""
   * Select the patch and let it run
      * If it fails, you may have a different region iso/patch or have cracks installed that prevent it applying properly
   * After the patch succeeds, right click the game and click ""configure""
   * Go to ""game options""
   * Change the executable from whatever/folders/Riddick.exe to whatever/folders/System/Win64_AMD64/SbzEngine.exe
   * Run the game
* In game
   * Go to settings and change the resolution to 1280 x 800
      * The default resolution is very weird and cuts off the sides of the screen
   * Enable gamepad
   * Re-configure the controls, the default gamepad has left and right sticks swapped from most games

One weird thing I have noticed, at least for me when I try to select a profile to continue a game I can't pick it with start/a, I had to set one of the keys to ""enter"". The gamepad works for all other menus.

Anyway, It seems fine after putting it back together. I'll give it several hours of heavy use to give it another thought.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, and someone recently posted that they're entering their 4th week of waiting for a 1TB Micron from ShopBLT, but they don't mind waiting for such a deep discount.   

The Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740, Corsair MP600 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300. 

Here's [the specs and review](https://www.techpowerup.com/ssd-specs/micron-2400-2-tb.d810)  for it as well.


Regarding Micro SDs, there are 2 main cards that this subreddit will recommend.    

[Samsung 512GB Evo Select ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1HMJ9Z) as this doesn't have a 1TB option    
Or    
[SanDisk 512GB Extreme](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X7C2GBC/) this DOES have a 1TB option, so buy what's in your budget.   

Keep in mind that the Evo Plus and Evo Select are the same cards just rebranded for Amazon. I believe Evo Plus is what Amazon has the rights to, but they're the same.",SteamDeck

jhwd99s,"Very niche market they are fulfilling. I bought the steam deck at $350 on sale because I wanted to play all my retro games using emudeck. Does up to PS2 flawlessly and even a lot of PS3 and Switch games. 

I will never want to play a triple A modern game on a tiny 7 inch screen instead of on a proper setup with max settings and a beautiful 1440p monitor. 

There’s a very small percentage of people who are willing to pay $700 to play those games in handheld form when current gen consoles are half that price.",SteamDeck
jhyiajh,more steam sales for valve either way.,SteamDeck

It would be worth it for me but I'm also a person that hates the shitty screen of the SteamDeck. I will replace my deck with the Rog Ally just to have a good screen for handheld mode.",SteamDeck

You will not get 1440p output from docking and you will get half the frames at half the resolution of a current gen console for double the cost so that’s not really something to factor into a handheld purchase",SteamDeck

Prodeus is more quakey/doom run and gun, fast action may be slightly difficult for touch controls if you’re not the best, but I bet easy would be fine

Cultic has a nice story, more fun Easter eggs like duke nukem, more relaxed play if you prefer sneaking around. Can make as hard or easy as you want I think.

We would literally bike 15+ miles around the city or cities. Technology was TV, VHS and for the super lucky an NES. And TV would go off the air at midnight. Technology just wasn't a big thing we grew up with and didn't really start becoming a major thing until after I graduated. Hell I graduated school before people had cellphones.

My point is I grew up in a weird era. We got technology but it was outside of our childhood. My 6 year old daughter handles tablets better than me but she literally was born into this high tech world. Small technology accomplishments for people like me are huge.",SteamDeck

Did my replay of GTA 4 on the Steam Deck for the first time since 2015(?) for the cheevos and all of it was perfectly playable on the Steam Deck, and the framerate cap shortcut being soooo much easier to fix the helicopter QTE at the end than having to change to a 30Hz resolution and turning on VSync to fix it.

It may have been a bad PC port upon release, but playing it on modern hardware today, it is now a massive improvement in performance and visuals IMO. Really elevates the game.

jhn57cj,Thanks I've been confused about this...,SteamDeck
jhn1i33,"You probably tried it on a 60 hz screen. The key point is that every frame should be displayed for an equal amount of time to achieve smooth motion. 60 fps runs perfectly on 60 hz because each game frame matches each refresh of the screen perfectly. 30 fps also works, with each frame being displayed twice. But 45 fps does not fit into 60 hz without displaying some frames longer than others.

On the Steam Deck, it is possible to run games smoothly at 45 fps, because you can just set the screen to refresh at 45 hz.",SteamDeck

I set the camera acceleration to 0 and sensitivity all the way up which helped a bit since it was mainly messing with me when moving the camera, but it was still strangely uncomfortable to play so I gave up for now. Too many other games in my backlog to be dealing with that lol",SteamDeck
jhnx2qr,The problem the previous guy references to is when you try to divide 45 frames over 60 refresh cycles. Dividing 45 frames over 45 screen refreshes gives you a steady frametime and therefor looks relatively smooth. As long as you can maintain the fps.,SteamDeck
jhn2sqv,It was on my Steam Deck! I maybe had the refresh still at 60 in that case,SteamDeck
jhn5dd3,So on Windows if I change the display to 45hz and set frames to 45 I can achieve the same effect?,SteamDeck
jhn0b80,"Lol we’ve all done it no worries, GTAIV has an unlocked frame rate however so on Series X it hits the 60fps target nearly constantly… which is actually game breaking but you know",SteamDeck

It's such a useful feature on Deck it's odd it's not so easy to achieve on Windows - you can create a custom resolution and refresh rate but it's not an intuitive process like on the SD.",SteamDeck
jhn3hzl,Likely! Although some stuff (like prerendered videos) might have a fixed framerate in some games and can only ever look smooth at that framerate or a multiple of it.,SteamDeck
jhnn9af,"If you can get the screen to actually refresh at 45 hz, the effect is the same, no matter the operating system.",SteamDeck
jhon12y,"I cant get it to work tho. I tried forcing it via steam (same menu as where you do proton etc). I also tried forcing it via ini config files. Does not seem to work for me, still jaggies.

Did you do anything special? Do you play it on tv or just the deck?",SteamDeck
jho2a28,"I dont think a piece of software (in this case Nvidia control panel) can force a display to display 45hz at a hardware level like the deck can.

I mean it might depend in the monitor and newer monitors can do more with variable refresh rates. But I dont think you can make a run of the mill monitor that natively does 60hz, run on 45 at a hardware level. I think in that case you would still have a situation when you softwarematicly force the display down to 45, but if its 60 native youll still be dividing 45 virtual hz over 60 actual hz before you even take fps into account

I can probably not explain it as technical as the eventual next guy who will probably correct me. But if this was a thing, it would probably be more popular. And this is why 30 fps is usually in the game options because its exactly double the frametime on a 60hz display and therefor will still look (relatively) smooth if that frametime remains steady.",SteamDeck
jhnqdlf,">If you can get the screen to actually refresh at 45 hz,

It's possible to set arbitrary refresh rates in Nvidia control panel right?",SteamDeck
jhp5053,"I didn't do anything special. I just modified the resolution in the launch options like you said you did. Downscaling essentially just adds some anti aliasing by default - but it's not going to fix every jaggy, it's just a nice little improvement. I only game on the deck itself.",SteamDeck
jho2k4p,Ah thanks - that makes sense - the Deck truly is special!,SteamDeck
jho1sci,"I haven’t really used that in years, but you can try to force different refresh rates there, yes. But most screens don’t actually support arbitrary refresh rates, particularly not down to 45 fps. Best to look up what your display supports and then plan your target framerate accordingly.",SteamDeck
jhonjz4,"Absolutely. No regrets! 
Certainly dont spend my days playing just that, but having an install of Skyrim with 400 mods running smoothly at 40fps on a device that fits in my backpack that I can take anywhere, is just mindblowingly fun to me. And thats just one example of all the fun this piece of tech brings me.",SteamDeck

The most important rule of any retro-gaming handheld or device is to just **PLAY YOUR GAMES.** Stop tinkering, stop messing with the settings for superfluous stuff and just play your games. You'll be much happier just trying to mess with everything under the sun. Pick some low-end games you know will run and just PLAY. You can worry about tinkering another time.",SteamDeck

jhrtcsg,"When mine is connected to a TV that is not powered on, the deck acts exactly the same as if I plugged in the charger only. The screen on the deck stays on until I power on the TV. 

When it is docked, I like to use the power menu (hit Steam button, it is the bottom option) to put it into sleep, instead of hitting the physical power button. This makes it so I am sure it went to sleep, and I can do it from my controller instead of walking over to the deck.",SteamDeck

When you're gaming on TV? In my example I never touched the TV, it's just connected for the few times I want to play on my TV.

jhutkj9,"It's absolutely faster hardware than the steam deck. The steam deck is over a year old, and it was announced a year before it released. It's got older hardware. Of course the ally is going to be faster. By the time the SD hit the market, the next gen apus were right around the corner and it was already behind. 

Better is subjective though. The ally will use windows, which imo, is a deal breaker. I wouldn't even consider one until steam os is running flawlessly on it.

Being more powerful, it will eat through battery faster. The SD, imo, is already pretty battery hungry. Adding to that isn't goong to help anything. 

The ally lacks trackpads. This isn't a deal breaker, but I do like them. 

The ally isn't OLED either. I don't care about the 800p resolution. At the small sizes, and with a battery powered device, you literally can't tell the difference between 1080p and 800p. However, an OLED would make a much bigger improvement, though at the expense of even more batter power. Maybe the Asus screen is a better ips, but thst isn't a big enough jump. 

The ally is going to be expensive. 

I love how you can open the SD, replace the joysticks and the SSD really easily. Will the Asus be the same? Maybe, we'll see. 

Some of the benefits of the ally are going to be game compatibility. Fortnite will work. Anti-cheat will work. It's windows (for better or worse, worse, imo). 

It will run games faster. It just will. I love the steam deck as much as anyone else here, but the hardware is a generation newer (plus some). 

And that last one is the biggest point. But it is yet to be seen what price it's released at. If it's too high, the extra performance isn't justified. And if it's too low, there isn't going to be enough profit in it for it to be a long term thing for Asus. They'll be one and done. The steam deck is already a success. We have guaranteed support for it. It's not that I don't think Asus will support it for awhile, but if it flops, they might not be keen on years of support. 

We just don't know right now. It's obvious going to be an awesome piece of hardware. With all the praise Linus is giving it, that is bound to be true. But it might not be a good value. We will see.",SteamDeck
jhussn8,"The Steam Deck can already do PS3.

As for the rest of your question, Asus claims ""double the performance"" of the Steam Deck. However, three things:

1. That is just a claim. It could actually be real, it could be just in one or maybe a handful of favorable games, or it could be just in artificial benchmarks. We've seen all of these tactics from both Intel, AMD, and Nvidia when battling it out in the CPU and GPU space, and there's generally always conditions of some sort. The real truth comes in independent reviews. Until that happens, all you have is marketing that you shouldn't trust with anything but the smallest grain of salt.

2. Even if the claims hold up, it's at 35W, or more than double the power envelope of the Steam Deck APU. Viewed through that lens, and the fact that it is two generations of architecture improvements on the CPU side and one gen on the GPU side, it's really not even that impressive. It should probably honestly be more, which means there's some inefficiency in the way the Ally works and/or the Steam Deck is punching well above its weight.

3. The Ally has a needlessly higher resolution screen than the Steam Deck. At 7in 800p is pixel dense enough, and driving all those extra pixels is going to take a toll on the performance overall. Ironically, the Ally would fare better if they weren't just trying to spec bump here for marketing purposes alone.

Also notoriously absent is any discussion whatsoever of battery life, and it's going to be this more than anything that's going to likely be the Ally's Achilles heel. Especially weighing in slightly lighter than the Steam Deck it can't have a substantially different battery on board, and pushing 35W (along with 120Hz high refresh) is going to absolutely drain it like a sieve. If it can last over 45min on a charge, it would be a minor miracle, unless you dial everything way back. In other words, stick to the same 15W power budget and drop down to 60Hz refresh. Though, if you do that, you basically just have a Steam Deck that you paid way more for.",SteamDeck

But value is subjective. If it comes in at a competitive price it still has to compete with track pads and SteamOS.

And there's that sneaky 400 dollar steam deck. But it looks promising! I'm rooting for them. I want to see cheaper options.",SteamDeck
jhv9ad7,"I'm interested to see battery life. I think it's possible that Steam Deck will have better performance at lower TDPs which means more battery life for older titles or indie games. 

Valve made a lot of careful tradeoffs around price, performance, battery life, input options, and OS experience that have delivered a great user experience. I have several casual gamer friends who I have recommended the Deck to and the relative ease of use when compared to a Windows PC has got them hooked.

I think Valve put a lot of thought into the Steam Deck's design that will help it age gracefully. There will always be something newer and faster, but the magic of the Steam Deck, like all great devices, is the combination of hardware and software.",SteamDeck

Steam Deck was nice, but its a hell of a different refresh rate wise.
So i sold the deck and I am waiting to order the Asus rog ally to be able to play indie games (metroidvania) with 100hz+ on low tdp.",SteamDeck
jhuueao,"I dunno. 

I think most of us realize that it's going to be faster. It's going to run games better. It's newer. Of course it will. Does a 4080 go faster than a 2080? Of course. It's silly to think otherwise. 

The question is of value. Will it be a good value or not. That is yet to be seen. If they can get it on the market for $699, it has a chance. But even that is pretty high. I doubt the SD would've been the success it was without the $399 model. Sure, that isnt the only one, but not sure helped to boost its popularity. 

An opening price of $699 doesn't get it under nearly as many Christmas trees as $399.

I'm on 10gig internet and I can only get about 600mbps on most downloads before my CPU caps out. Even my desktop is screaming for mercy before either my SSDs or Steam's CDNs call quit. Wanted 25gig but almost no services can keep up at 10 already so I stopped there. Haven't been able to test local transfer so I don't know if decompression is also a bottleneck there. You can reach faster speeds with preload (no decompression, decryption and purely sequential) though docking will become a requirement, 4-5gbps+ is no problem. Faster random access and a bigger SLC/DRAM cache might help with updates or very large installs though, ex: I prefer redownloading certain games like Squad because it's faster than updating, too much unpacking/repackaging and heavy random IO, faster to do it sequentially. A good drive with good random RW is a nice plus. But in short, doesn't really matter for normal use, you could have 25gig wired to your deck and even then something will cap out first before your nvme drive be it loading, installs, updates; or have minimal impact.",SteamDeck

Those are proton files for your games. The numbers will match up against the game's ID on the Steam Store.

These are files for the Flatpak's you've installed via Discover. In fact, all the files under that flatpak folder are for your flatpaks.

You can delete stuff in compatdata and common for any games you're no longer playing or uninstall some of the flatpak stuff through the Discover Store. If you have an SD, you can try to offload some of your shaders to an SD card or delete ones for games you're no longer playing.",SteamDeck
jhqmkvv,It’s a fair point. I agree with the general consensus that this is a software problem (not being able to store these misc. files on the SD).

jhqqssj,"You really should have gotten the 256GB model, then, but of course that's no help now. You could probably find a local PC repair shop that could do the upgrade for you. Might just have to call around a little.

Unfortunately, I think Valve is really doing a disservice to users here. They wanted to hit an arbitrary $400 price point and cut down far too much on the storage to get there. It would have been better if they just offered a storage less option for people to upgrade on their own for that price. At least then it would be clear that you probably shouldn't go for it unless you feel comfortable doing that. 64GB for a platform where single games are sometimes larger than that is just ridiculous, though. Even phones come with more storage on base models these days.",SteamDeck
jhsah4o,"Even if you could offload to the SD, what happens if the SD card fails?  Corrupts?  Slows down with age?

There is a reason things are stored in a fast, highly available drive.

I would watch a couple of videos on changing the SSD out.  I know you're concerned about doing it - but dude, they made this thing serviceable. 

You're talking 10 screws (or was it 11?).  No soldering, no macro-disassembly - it is literally taking the back off, removing a heat shield and replacing the drive.

I highly recommend a quality, brand name fast as hell card.  Sandisk Extreme class.

My card isn't dead yet.  In fact, no one has legitimately reported Windows killing their card (unless I somehow missed it).

Don't get me wrong, if you buy a shitty SD card you are going to have a really bad time. BUT let's not forget that Microsoft themselves (amongst many manufacturers) have been selling Windows running from eMMC storage for at least a decade. If you buy a really good SD card, it *can* work OK.

I would recommend getting a portable USB SSD and installing Windows on that. Speeds will be way better and so will longevity.",SteamDeck
jhsm4a6,"Yes, it's perfectly fine. Anyone saying Windows will kill the microSD is parroting nonsense and doesn't know what they're talking about in the slightest. They never actually have any real experience. They just want to seem like they know stuff.

To be clear, microSD is a flash medium and like all flash media, has a defined lifespan measured in writes. While it does have typically less TBW (terabytes that can be written over its life) than something like a SSD, it's still in the neighborhood of 150 TBW or more, which is an absolute crap ton, to use the technical term, of data. Using Windows to play games will not remotely approach that. If you could actually kill a microSD in a matter of months as some people claim from running Windows, every desktop Windows user would be replacing their SSDs yearly. That's obviously not the case.

As far as speed goes, yes it's going to be slow. However, it's not much different in practice than if you were to simply run Windows off a spinning rust HDD. There'd be delays and slowdowns, of course, but it's ultimately still usable. Once you're in game, there's no difference whatsoever. That said, you absolutely *must* use an A2 rated card, because you need the vastly increased IOPS that supports. People saying Windows isn't usable at all on microSD have almost certainly tried with an A1 card, and yeah, that's going to be an abysmal experience.",SteamDeck
jhqyn6v,"Not really, no. Windows tends to kill cards within about six months to a year. 

In theory if you can put up with slowdowns (because a cap of \~100mb/s isn't very fast for win10/11), and if you use it literally only for anticheat games and absolutely nothing else it might last a little longer, but it's still gonna get expensive replacing those cards.

jhry2g9,"Not the best , if not the worst genre to play on the steam deck because most do not have controller support and not meant to be played on a small screen. Most of them were not made with UI that properly fits a 720p/800p screen so you usually end up with UI elements filling up your screen and blocking views. With such a small screen it is also hard to see what’s going on.

Trackpads do work but nowhere near as comfortable as playing with real mouse. Most also really make use of a keyboard to play effectively. There may be some community controllers profiles available that may help a bit mapping keyboard keys to the gamepad, or you can try making your own but will most likely feel unintuitive or awkward to play.

The only one that plays well so far is Halo Wars and that’s because that’s a port of a console game. Plays really well on the steam deck and the gamepad controls are surprisingly good!


You can try looking for console RTS games to see if the Steam version has controller support. If there is an RTS that was ported to consoles there is a chance the developers ported the console UI and controls to Steam, but that’s not always the case (looking at you Northgard)",SteamDeck

Yeah you can expand the storage with an SD card. I'm not using the expensive type either and its working fine. Also, the internet connection depends on the games you play.

jhs1eiq,"Most games require an internet connection when starting the game the first time, but after that, internet is not needed. 

There are some games that have a launcher that needs internet to launch the game. These can still be played offline if you launch it while you have internet, you can then disconnect from the internet and play offline just fine. You can even put the system to sleep and resume without the need for internet. The only reason you would need to reconnect is if you shut the game down and want to restart it. 

An SD card is basically a must have for the 64gb model. Also, install decky, and a plugin called Storage Cleaner. It will be a very useful plugin for the 64gb model especially. It will allow you to manage the files that automatically install on the internal memory (shader cache and compdata), which build up pretty quick on the 64gb (they will show up as ""Other"" when looking at your storage menu). 

If the 64gb ends up not being enough space for you, even with an SD card, then you could always upgrade the internal storage later.",SteamDeck

Second, if a license disallows multiboxing, then if that game is being played on one device, prevent \_that game\_ from being played on the other device, not the entire library.

Theres widely known workarounds, going offline etc, but that blocks certain game functions. People who would share logins to play the game without buying it would just pirate the thing, its easier.

Because it’s new you first need to create a partition table.

Hook up the drive, fire up KDE Partition manager. Select create new table and hit apply. 

The partition table is now created but the data is unallocated, which makes it unusable by Linux. Leave it unallocated! When you execute the command, the process will clone the partition structure of your current drive, fixing the allocation.

Run the command. For 64gig it should take about 5 mins.

Afterwards, check the partition manager again. It should now show that the drive is partitioned identically to your internal drive.

jhpzsdr,Crab pots have to be already on the water. Have the bait in your hand and press X (i think) and the lid should pop open and closed with a sound. You can only put 1 piece of bait in the pot at a time (it's not like the fishing pole) and the pot has to be empty of fish/rubbish.,SteamDeck

jhqrpg5,"The best way to put it is SteamOS is not Arch, it is just based in Arch. The OS is intentionally locked out of the box to prevent you doing exactly this. Vanilla Arch updates can break the OS. Unless you a very comfortable in what you are doing and happy to deal with any issues you encounter it's best left to Valve to manage the underlying OS updates.",SteamDeck
jhqrh1b,"I'm honestly not sure what would happen, but SteamOS is arch-based, it's not technically arch as if you just installed it directly. It likely would break something as package versions are potentially chosen for a reason, and newer/different versions may not be compatible with portions of SteamOS.",SteamDeck
jhqru5a,"Pretty sure that would bork the entire OS since it's running off a specific repository and that update command pulls from the main one.



Thatd be like trying to force a ton of windows specific updates onto a Mac?


Hence the reason why ""pacman"" commands are disabled by default, so you DON'T do what you're talking about doing.",SteamDeck
jhr4aa1,"The short answer: Yes. 

The long answer: While SteamOS is Arch-based, as others have said, SteamOS is not Arch. It’s like Ubuntu is Debian-based, but isn’t Debian. Valve pushes updates  because they’re making stuff work with SteamOSs specific quirks.

The good news is that you can just install Arch if you really want to. You then get the packages you want and decent compatibility with Proton. This might negatively affect battery life because extra processes in the background, but *shrugs*",SteamDeck

jhr64n0,"Nobody specifically mentioned the most important difference: The root filesystem is read-only on SteamOS. You have to unlock it to install anything with pacman. And everything you do install will be gone with the next SteamOS update. They overwrite the whole partition. In that regard SteamOS is more similar to Android than Arch.

So, if you want some packages to stick around you should write a script to install them quickly after an update.",SteamDeck
jhqs0md,Thanks!  Makes perfect sense.,SteamDeck
jhqrsg6,That is my thinking also.  I will just use the pacman tool to install the packages I want to add.,SteamDeck

jhs25t4,"If you configure the pacman.conf correctly it should just pull from whatever is configured there, doesn't have to be the main one. I don't have a SD rn to check what's in it though.",SteamDeck
jhqs7fu,"As per my other reply, proceed with caution. Out of the box this is not possible and ill advised. SteamOS uses an immutable file system. Future Valve updates can break packages installed this way. SteamOS is intentionally limited to using Flatpaks (and AppImages) for 3rd party software unless you unlock the file system and are happy dealing with any issues that may arise.",SteamDeck
jhr7m3n,"One major difference from regular Arch is that Steam locks down the OS with a readonly filesystem. So anything outside of your /home and flatpaks may be overwritten by the next SteamOS update.

So I would be wary of using pacman at all. Your best bet is to only use the Discover Store. If you still want to use pacman, use the following commands to change the readonly flag:

 `sudo steamos-readonly disable`

 `sudo steamos-readonly enable`

Then you can run pacman as normal. But again, there's no guarantee you won't break your SteamOS build.",SteamDeck
jhqts77,"You can disable the ""read only"" file system to allow ""pacman"" commands for basic stuff like package installation etc.


There's a few things this can be useful for on the deck. Deep level access, installing some apps and packages (like Java) through the console etc.


Just don't attempt an update to the OS from the main Arch repository, it would probably annihilate your whole SteamOS install.",SteamDeck

`sudo systemctl enable --now sshd`

ji1r61n,"Well Im not sure about Moonlight as I stream most my stuff through my xbox. However I did fix the issue last night with the Flatpaks. Here is how I fixed it.

1. Install Decky loader if you don't already have it.
2. In Decky loader install the plug-in ""AutoFlatpaks""
3. Open AutoFlatpaks in Decky loader.
4. Update and install anything it says is out of date. At the end it might throw an error it couldnt fix that so you may need to run a repair within AutoFlatpaks.
5. Restart your Steam Deck.
6. Check AutoFlatpaks once more and you should be done.

Once you go back to desktop mode youll notice everything is up to date. Who knows maybe it will fix your Moonlight issue also! Good Luck fellow Decker!",SteamDeck
ji3t2b7,Ok i did this. Still not updating kde platform. Did work for moonlight. Still not launching emulators thou. When i go into files in desktop mode and launch from there it says emulator is encrypted.,SteamDeck

Disk based copy protection can still be an issue however.",SteamDeck
jhom0t6,"So this isn't completely what you asked so ignore it if it doesn't apply to you, but I found some places will give you the game on their launcher if you own the old disc. I had Spore and Dead Space 2 on disc, so I called up EA and told them I couldn't access them anymore since they were registered to some very old computers. They just added the games to my Origin account.",SteamDeck
jhnwt1v,"Yeah, either connect an optical drive to your Deck using USB, or make an .ISO of the discs and mount those on the Deck.

Haven't checked the video, but take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVbB5v6_cwk). If that doesn't help you, then you know what to look for.

Make an ISO: https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-an-iso-file-from-a-cd-or-dvd-on-any-operating-system/ - first result on Google, there might be better guides, but again, now you know what to look for.

In the case of Mass Effect and the GTA's, I figure that it's probably easier to install them from Steam, and I figure that GTA 4 and 5 are probably Steam keys anyways, so you probably have no use for the discs.

Don't know about Sega Rally though.

Oh yeah, once you've either mounted the ISO or have the discs in an optical drive, you can find a guide for how to add non-Steam games like this. There are quite a few in this sub. But basically you just add the setup file to Steam, run it, and replace it with the setup file with the .exe file once the game is installed.",SteamDeck

> Destiny 2 is not supported for play on the Steam Deck or on **any system utilizing Steam Play’s Proton** unless Windows is installed and running.  Players who attempt to launch Destiny 2 on the Steam Deck **through SteamOS or Proton** will be unable to enter the game and will be returned to their game library after a short time.

> Players who are not accessing Destiny 2 through Windows and attempt to **bypass the SteamOS/Proton** incompatibility will be met with a game ban.

Windows is fine. Steam Deck is fine. Proton translation layer *(which is used on SteamOS and Linux)* is what’s disallowed.",SteamDeck

In practice, Bungie *hates* the Steam Deck and everyone is too scared of getting banned to test this out. Their wording has muddied this whole situation, saying they'll ban players for running the game on Deck, seemingly regardless of whether or not you're running windows on it.

jhqyuk8,"all in all, you can install Windows 10/11 and run Destiny just fine there... i split my 256gb Steamdeck storage in half, and dual booted windows and SteamOS for months - did this primarily to play Destiny as well.   The game runs pretty decently, i did low settings, and 90 FOV.. it would run around 45-60 fps and was super fun to play.  load times and menu lag was not great though.  Then, a few nights ago.. i loaded up Windows, and had a bunch of updates pending, and realized i needed to update the GPU driver as well, and ultimately decided that I was tired of maintaining the Windows install all the time.. just wanted to have more of a pick up and play experience.   I switched back to SteamOS.. and setup GeForce Now..and wanted to see how streaming it would work with latency and all..  and I can say that, it is fantastic.. I can barely feel any latency, and since it runs at a rock solid 60 FPS.. the game feels way more responsive overall, and load times are instant as well.   I completed wiped my Window install and I'm much happier this way.  I would certainly recommend you to try Windows anyway.. but for just a few dollars a month..

1. Diablo II Resurrected - Absolutely amazing on the SD and works great for playing either online or single player with no connection required.
2. Dauntless - Super fun to play mobile, although an internet connection is required, works flawlessly tethered to my phone with minimal lag
3. Hitman Trilogy - All of these games run great on the deck. Until this past year I've never played a single one of these games but absolutely loved them. I think you can play this with no internet connection, but  I can't remember.
4. The Division 2 - Runs smoothly on deck but it's definitely a battery sucker. I find shooters to be quite difficult on controllers, but since this is mostly PvM I don't mind so much. Requires internet connection to play. 
5. Madden 2022 / 23 - I don't even watch football, but for some reason football games are fun. Runs great, no internet connection required. 
6. Super Mega Baseball 3 - Very stylized, light, and fun baseball game. No internet connection required.
7. Mortal Shell - Runs pretty great. I've only put about 3 hours or so into this game, though, so I'm not sure how it fairs later on in the game. I got really confused with navigation and kept running around in circles and haven't picked it back up since. I should probably just ready some guides or something, because it was quite fun.

All of these, with the exception of Diablo II, are running off of an micro SD card running Windows 10. Games like Division 2  and Dauntless need Easy Anti Cheat and that doesn't work on Steam OS. Pretty amazing having a handheld Windows machine.",SteamDeck
jhk13vd," Many games meet those requirements, and then it's a matter of taste. But now I'm playing the vanilla version of Fallout 4 and it's pretty awesome. Fixed 60 FPS, both indoors and outdoors, with a mix of mids and highs. It looks and feels really great.

If you think adjusting performance sliders is too much tinkering, how about those like me, who go compressing, resizing and cropping cutscene  bink videos just to get the perfect aspect ratio, video quality and optimal size for the steam deck?
Maybe that should be called ""tHinkering""",SteamDeck

jhipm8a,"It's 16:10 for a very good reason: It needs to be 768 or higher vertical pixels because of old game compatibility (the vast majority of games on Steam). The default resolutions for older games are 640x480, 800x600, then 1024x768. If they went with a higher resolution screen that would solve the trick, but this was the lowest resolution screen they could have gone with while still supporting 1024x768 for compatibility reasons.",SteamDeck
jhixwe4,"I’m the opposite, I love the 16:10 aspect ratio when games support it, so refreshing and that vertical space is very useful in shooters for example.",SteamDeck
jhisnal,"It sucks but I think the solution is that more games should natively support 16:10, though i can understand the annoyance of older titles that do make you wish for a 16:9 display. Steamdecks rise in popularity and rise in support by game developers who primarily put their games on there are more likely to support 16:10 in the coming years, in fact I would be surprised if hades 2 for example didn't support it on launch which originally had no support in the first, now a popular recommended game for steamdeck. This is just speculation, though, and I could be wrong and am partly coping. It just seems more plausible now than ever, considering previously they could not be bothered to support the minority who had 16:10 monitors for their desktop.",SteamDeck

jhjdowp,"right? i love metal gear just never got round to playing V. had it in my library for sooo long with about 10hrs logged. I liked it, just other games kept grabbing my attention. soon as i got a deck i tried it out & RINSED it

actually glad i waited & got to play it first on the deck. same with a few other games like Hitman 2 & Yakuza games",SteamDeck
jhk7c1d,heck yes! so much fun,SteamDeck
jhj6joi,"MGS5 is ***very*** well optimized and runs at 60 fps easy. 

If you tweak some settings you can get it to run at like 10-13 watts.",SteamDeck
jhj5uxv,"Don’t be afraid to push it! No game you play will just break your deck, it’s there to be played on. It’s more then capable of running even newer games which demand alot more power from the deck (look at cyberpunk running 30fps on it). These titles i listed are all on last gen consoles, besides rollerdrome.

Runs great at 60! I never noticed the fan noise while playing, so either they weren’t too loud or i had the speakers up loud enough to mask it. Either way you’ll have a great time with it if you like stealth games. I got 94hrs out of it, most of it on the deck.

You can get it for under a fiver on 3rd party sites, or around the same when it’s on sale on steam",SteamDeck
jhj8luq,Nah doesn’t get too loud and surprisingly gets a lot more battery than other comparable titles I’ve tried.,SteamDeck
jhjae07,"Like the other guy said, you won’t push it with most stuff, and it’s also true that you will *never* break your Deck that way. It’s designed to shutoff before any point of bad stuff happening is reached. If it makes you feel any better, I played 130 hours of Death Stranding on Deck - which is demanding af and at times horribly optimized for the Deck - and all was well. Temps were high at times but nothing happened. 

It handles MGSV fine though. Didn’t mess with any settings and 60 FPS just seems to work.",SteamDeck
jhjzceh,MGS V actually isn’t that demanding. It’s easy to forget it’s actually a ps3/360 generation game,SteamDeck
jhilkbv,"ah i forgot that, besides that & the graphics options staying (not tested so just assuming) they all work great. had so much fun playin em all on the deck",SteamDeck
jhkknkj,You can run this at 4K60. I played docked on the OLED.,SteamDeck
jhkb7s0,"I have to agree with this, I been struggling with the precision shooting too (and don't like to use the touchpads).  Any solution?",SteamDeck
jhk1uoq,Use touchpad + gyro. Accuracy problems solved.,SteamDeck
jhjuc97,"I had issues with it early on and didn't keep trying. I probably should have. I've played through it quite a few times, so it didn't seem worth learning a new control set up for it.",SteamDeck
jhlbe9t,It's perfect with gyro + touchpad,SteamDeck
jhl5ah5,Same! I can’t figure out why or what I’m doing wrong. It wasn’t too bad dealing with vortigaunts but when you get to the fighting the military parts I can’t do anything and have to use my computer,SteamDeck

jhk4ne6,Buy black mesa,SteamDeck
jhkewqb,"Definitely don't need to. You will find plenty of good summaries of the story, both video and written. It's entertaining, though even that isn't necessary to enjoy HL2.

If you end up loving HL2 (it's great), you can go back and play Black Mesa (Valve approved fan made update on the game).

It's also worth watching Freeman's Mind if you find yourself enjoying the HL universe.

Edit: fixed autocorrect, Mess to Mesa",SteamDeck
jhknlmw,Black Mesa is definitely the way to go if you want to play the story of HL1 before 2. It's a true labor of love and it shows,SteamDeck
jhkuz7i,"No, but you should just for the sake of it. I might have the nostalgia glasses on, but 1 is just as good as 2",SteamDeck
jhlr6ro,no but i highly recommend it,SteamDeck
jhik371,"Yeah, it’s a known issue with several games on the deck. It sucks, but dead cells does have a really good “save game” functionality where you can quit your run, exit the game, turn the deck off, come back later and start up again and just keep on going. It’s annoying, but it does work really well.",SteamDeck
jhkzy0m,So apparently the fix for this is to force proton. The Linux build is kinda bugged and once you switch to the windows version the game runs just fine and audio doesn’t get bugged out. I haven’t played in awhile and I haven’t tried this method out so take it with a grain of salt. I do intend to do it though. Dead cells is excellent and I don’t mind starting over on windows version.,SteamDeck
jhjhu5v,There's a decky plugin to pause games on suspension that fixed this for me.,SteamDeck
jhilpjq,Using proton 6.3-8 fixed this for me,SteamDeck
jhkx2ar,"Why? I finally picked it up during the current sale because I have always been pretty into Tetris-likes, but I can not tell (from videos and stuff) what is so great about this title. I'll get to try it out tonight.",SteamDeck
jhkirk6,Indeed!,SteamDeck
jhm8wsc,Gawd I wish it was cheeper,SteamDeck
jhkxkh2,"Yes, I do the same, but I just use the left stick to zoom in while I'm playing. I didn't know there is a permanent zoom setting though, so will definitely check that out.",SteamDeck
jhl2hma,Such a good game! I played it so much back in the day on my PSP. Those were good times,SteamDeck
jhl7qzk,If you ever played flatout back then it’s a mix of the two. Great game!,SteamDeck
jhl85zt,Wreckfest is great,SteamDeck
jhljvfq,I think it was made by the Burnout devs.,SteamDeck
jhjgm8t,"Right! It was the first game I tried (after desk job, which for me counts more like a tutorial level for the steam deck) and I was absolutely blown away
Well, I played on a 400€ Laptop before, got max 25-30 fps on lowest settings 😂",SteamDeck
jhk918l,"Absolutely - it challenges you to be a good racer, strategic crasher, and to adapt to wild situations.",SteamDeck
jhk1tbu,It does have a career mode,SteamDeck
jhmdl0y,"There is a career mode but it's essentially a very long tutorial (20-30 hours) for the tournament mode (think daily missions) and online lobbys.

I can somewhat recommend Wreckfest as I have some 200 hours in it, but it has some issues with balancing.

The AI has some stupid rubberbanding and the Hammerhead RS car is miles above all other cars but takes like 5 hours (!) of grinding tournament mode to unlock. And you will see between 3 and 5 Hammerhead RS in every 20 player lobby you join.",SteamDeck
jhkaz6f,"Mine doesn’t launch, either, when I use proton experimental",SteamDeck
jhje2ex,"It should work fine out of the box via Steam, but I personally use proton experimental",SteamDeck
jhisg4d,it has a good singleplayer.,SteamDeck
jhk64gz,you may need to hear more.. stardew valley modded,SteamDeck
jhllzv5,"might be the most travel efficient game on deck, i remember i got it saying around 9 hours battery life with all the power settings turned down to the lowest i felt comfortable going",SteamDeck
jhkionb,You should play The Unsung War. It's a great game.,SteamDeck
jhk9ix8,"I feel like I would think the same as you, but I looking back at it now. I did really enjoy the top gun films. Maybe I’ll give AC a try.",SteamDeck
jhk9gtl,Sure it’s a fps. M&k is king. But still I was impressed they updates the game to take advance of the hardware.,SteamDeck
jhk5xxk,"100% agree.  Hollow Knight is soo good!  I own it on 3 platforms, lol.  I forced myself to forget about Silksong to keep from being constantly disappointed =)",SteamDeck
jhj51ia,Why do I get so bored with this game? The constant backtracking and no map in new areas are killing me.,SteamDeck
jhjwmh5,Never noticed bro,SteamDeck
jhj7hwz,Pretty sure you just need to change the screen from fullscreen to Windowed for it to work perfectly.,SteamDeck
jhj35ci,"No, not that I can think of.  It’s been over a month since I played it but I think it worked just fine. Played while I was on vacation.",SteamDeck
jhkswwr,First world problems but anytime a game comes out on the game pass i can't justify buying it for the deck.,SteamDeck
jhkffkx,Will of the wisps is amazing man. One of my favorite games of all time. Basically a lot like the first but even better in a lot of ways 👌,SteamDeck
jhk5hsw,"I've bought Zomboid after getting the deck, and so far I'm enjoying it so much. Everything works really well.

There's a tiny bit of tinkering with the controls, but it's flawless on deck. It took me a while get used to the inventory, but nkt because of the deck - but because od the UI.",SteamDeck
jhjtfkv,"You'd think it would, but no, it's actually not bad. Good controller support for a game like this.",SteamDeck
jhinp4m,"My mistake I should have specified better, I only mentioned it as it is another 2k game that I know of that skips the launcher and have no idea how it performs. I'll adjust the list appropriately to specifically target the OPs original question.

jhizy2j,"I had heard a lot about vampire survivors but hadn't really looked into what it was. It got added to gamepas so I decided to try it out and was pretty confused when I started that this game was getting so much love. My girlfriend was on her way out to work when I just started playing and she stopped and watched me play for a minute and we laughed about how this game had generated so much love. Anyways, long story short, she came back from work 6 hours later and I had done nothing but play vampire survivors all day. It's amazing.",SteamDeck

jhio5t7,"Nope, they redid the engine in the beta and it's stable all the way to the end.",SteamDeck
jhnys7s,"It's a lot better now. It only really chugs when you overlevel certain weapons that eat a lot of frames, which doesn't happen in normal gameplay, or start farming eggs. Runs perfectly fine, especially with the new engine, in most cases until you are more in the endgame of the game's progression.",SteamDeck
jhkqama,"I have bannerlord on my deck and it's done better than I expected. It is very playable during 1000 man battles. The problem is the clunkiness of movement and formation commands. Individual combat works fine, but I prefer a mouse.",SteamDeck

jhrk2mo,"All of them Run on the Steam Deck natively! Well, at least they did when I played them a couple months ago :)",SteamDeck
jhob71t,"In fairness to OP's question it's not 100% perfect. It's probably 95% fine but there are a few little issues.

I occasionally get a little lower frame rate when there's a lot of action going on. It's only slight and doesn't take me out of the gameplay but it is noticeable.

It's needed to either enable or disable anti-cheat on launch to get that to work (the launch options for it are reversed - theres a post on halo waypoint for April 2023 explaining it).
I believe anti-cheat also affects achievements - I got them to work once but can't remember how...

I haven't played multiplayer at all so can't comment on that.

But the campaign is totally playable without any major issues, controls are great, load time for levels was maybe 5 seconds at the longest. So far I've played through halo reach, 1, 2, and 3 on legendary.

The only real issue I've found is that sometimes MCC freezes on exit. But this doesn't seem to affect saving at all, and that issue may have been solved with the latest proton version.

I'm sure all this this has already been commented elsewhere on this subreddit or r/halo, but hope this helps anyway :)",SteamDeck
jhkbvo3,Yeah. To add on to this comment though if you haven’t played it yes DOS2 is the best game I’ve ever played.,SteamDeck
jhmu5oo,Yeah buddy! I didn’t know games could be even made like that. My next game on the list has gotta be baldurs gate 3 (which I’ll have to play on desktop but still). I’m also looking for more like it if anyone has any suggestions ( considering darkest dungeon but am intimidated haha).,SteamDeck

jhjgub5,For Karl!,SteamDeck
jhj44cw,DM me…,SteamDeck
jhpd6uj,"0 and Kiwami run great at 60fps. Kiwami 2 runs at 40fps because of (what I presume) is a different / modified engine - there's crap on the streets everywhere and I think the physics is what makes the game chug a bit. Also there's no load screens when going into shops so it's just an all round more graphically and CPU intensive game. Yakuza 3, 4, 5 are ""only"" remastered - basically PS1 games with updated textures etc. and run at 60fps. I'm not far enough through the series yet to comment on the more recent ones - song of life, like a dragon and ishini - I'm not sure if they're Kiwami engine or ""remastered"" engine, but the first 6 games are basically 60fps with Kiwami 2 being the only exception.",SteamDeck
jhljehp,The only thing it's missing is full keyboard support. You have to use a shortcut to bring up the on screen keyboard instead of it coming up automatically when you need it. If they fixed that it would be 100% compatible.,SteamDeck

jhj6s5h,"Actually it works very well.
I don't really use the touchpads, I use it like a full controller and it works amazing.

D-pad up for the equipped items such as your bow or your ax.

R1 is the crafting menu and it's a radial wheel for everything.

I do recommend dropping everything to low for battery life, and switching it to DirectX 11.

With everything on high I get about an hour and a half of battery life, but with everything on low with the exception of textures I get about 3 hours of battery life.",SteamDeck

jhnqp89,"Mod author here :)

/u/DeckerSteam already gave the short answer, but I have a FAQ entry dedicated to answering that so I'll just copy/paste it in case you want more details about why / when modding would disable achievements in a game:

> ### Do achievements still work when using Hephaistos?
> 
> **Short answer:** Yes. Hades uses client-side achievements (i.e. achievements are managed by the game, not by Steam / Epic Games / Microsoft Store) and Hephaistos does not touch anything achievements-related: achievements still work exactly like in the original game.
> 
> **Longer answer:** No matter the platform (Steam, Epic Games, Microsoft Store), achievements can be of 2 types: client (offline checks) or server (online checks).
> 
> Client achievements are most common. In this mode, achievements are handled client-side (i.e. by the game), offline. There is no check or anything done by the platform: the client sends a message saying ""unlock X achievement on Y game"" and platform says ""sure"". This is why you can use [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) to unlock (and even relock) any client achievement of your choice without any consequences. Client achievements are basically ""we don't care if anyone cheats, this is only for fun"" achievements.
> 
> Server achievements are less common. In this mode, achievements are handled server-side (i.e. by the game server or the platform), online. This makes it harder to cheat achievements because the client does not have direct control over achievement checks. If the client (i.e. the game) is also tamper-protected (e.g. Steam's VAC system), then cheating is extremely hard / impossible. Server achievements are basically ""serious"" achievements.
> 
> Any game (no matter if offline or online) can use any type of achievements (client or server). There can even be a mix of both client and server achievements on the same game. With that said:
> 
> - Offline games will almost always use client achievements. It is very rare for offline games to use server achievements.
> - Online games will typically either:
>   - Use only client achievements (and rarely a few server achievements, usually newer achievements added after release).
>   - Use only server achievements (and rarely a few client achievements, usually older legacy achievements added before release).
> 
> In any case, the takeaway is that there is no reason any mod would disable achievements on any game without tamper-protection:
> 
> - Client achievements should not be disabled by the mod (unless you specifically use a mod that says it does that).
> - Server achievements cannot be disabled by the mod, period.
> 
> However, if the game does use tamper-protection, then you don't want to use any mod at all (even if the mod actually does nothing) because you'd get flagged just because your game has been modified.
> 
> In Hades' case, the game is offline, only uses client achievements, and is not tamper-protected. Hephaistos does not touch anything achievements-related: achievements still work exactly like in the original game, so you may do whatever you want with the achievements including using [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) to unlock / relock all of them if you please.",SteamDeck

It certainly helped for me that my favourite gaming experience up to that point was exploring the world of the first Dark Souls. Hollow Knight scratched that itch so goddamn well. It came so much closer to giving me that mixed feeling of thrill, fear and wonder that exploring DS1 did even compared to its sequels. 

I could go on forever about the similarities but Hallownest and Lordran are by far my 2 favourite game worlds ever. It helps that both games have very tight and engaging gameplay as well.

(ps1) MGS (yes Im a metal gear fanatic lol), Crash, Spyro, FF9 (use save states lol), Resident Evil 1,2 & 3, 

(SNES) Zombies ate my Neighbors (short levels that you can blow threw in a few min VERY ADDICTING GAME PLAY!) Breath of fire, FF3(6), Legend Of Zelda link to the past, Mega Man X series, 

(Game Boy/Color) Pokemon (get them all once you play the 1st one you'll be hooked), Mario, Zelda, Tetris, 

(Sega Genesis) Sonic (get them all lol), Aladdin, Road Rash, Phantasy Star. I could go on all day with retro stuff the Steam Deck is amazing for emulation.

For more modern stuff,

Ion Fury, Dusk, Project Warlock, Shovel Night, Fallout 1 & 2, Diablo 1 & 2, Portal 1 & 2, Half-Life (And the expansions) Half-Life 2 (And the Episodes), Command And Conquer.

jhorin9,"It's gotta run on (aka support) the same hardware BoTW did, so it can't be all the significantly more demanding",SteamDeck
jhnx6qg,"Dude, you can be easily disproven by looking at ex-ps4 exclusives on deck. It runs GoW, Days Gone, Uncharted on the same settings, albeit 720/800p. And these are exclusives that are always more optimised for the original console. If you look at multiplatform games from ps4/xone era, sometimes deck can even play them up to 2x faster. Mad Max, Witcher, Hitman games all can reach 60. 40fps is the sweet spot for them, ofc. Shit, this little device can even run cyberpunk locked 30.",SteamDeck
jhmu3zq,"Yeah I doubt it, but I wouldn't mind 😅",SteamDeck
jhn20tg,"Yes, because i will spend the 12th of May with playing TOTK and will respond here on 13th :)",SteamDeck
jhow8mp,not how that works. there are hundred of games made on unity using the same exact assets with wildly different performance. same engine or same assets doesn’t mean it won’t be more demanding,SteamDeck
jhnzc1d,Shit you made me laugh. God of war on the ps4 runs at 60fps at 1080p. The deck requires lowest settings and 720p at 40ish fps,SteamDeck

jho1g3x,Also in your second link the steamdeck is at 720p. 720p is literally half the total pixels of 1080p. So yes the steamdeck is half as strong as a ps4 from 2013,SteamDeck

For shutdown issue:  I think the steam deck tries to go through the maintenance tasks for the sd card, but due to it failing, it isn't able to finish the task, so it is never able to shutdown successfully, so it turns on to try the maintenance tasks again to shutdown successfully, except it fails again, and the process never completes, leading to shutdowns via menu being impossible (7 second hold down on the power button to force a shutdown works, but could potentially cause issues, such as loss of progress in unsaved games).

For sleep/wake issue:  I think the steam deck tries to do maintenance tasks for the sd card, but fails (because the sd card is failing, causing the process to be incomplete).  Since the task process failed, it is unable to enter sleep successfully, leading to the steam deck being stuck in a state where the screen (where it shows the actual steam stuff) is unable to come back on until shutdown (either through the power menu, or the forced shutdown method).

Extra thoughts:  This makes me think that the power menu and steam gaming mode (and possibly desktop mode) are stopped at different steps in the shutdown process.  That thought comes from the fact that the power menu shows up fine on a failed sleep/wake process, but the picture behind it is already off, and cannot (as far as I have been able to find) be turned back on without a restart of the system.

Below are speculations as to the processes of the steam deck for shutting down and going into sleep mode based on my personal observations:

The process might look something like this when a failing sd is causing a failed shutdown:
Power button is held -> Power menu shows -> ""Shutdown"" selected -> Steam process stops (possibly, or the display of the steam stuff is disabled or turned off.  Possibly a process?) -> Screen does not shut off (fans still going) -> ""Black"" screen (still possible to use power menu, might see if steam button works later)

How the process might work in a successful shutdown:
Power button is held -> Power menu shows up -> ""Shutdown"" selected -> Steam process/display/picture is disabled/turned off/stopped -> Quick maintenance tasks (possibly, might even be going in the background while the rest of the process is running, the whole time, possibly) -> steam deck shuts down

Failed sleep/wake process:
Power button is pressed/Power menu is up, and ""Sleep"" is selected -> Display turns off (maintenance tasks may be running in the background) -> failing sd card causes the maintenance tasks to fail -> steam deck comes back on

Sleep/wake process (successful):
Sleep mode is selected/power button is pressed -> display turns off (possibly with maintenance tasks going in the background) -> fans slow/less battery consumption/etc.",SteamDeck
jhyeybm,"Kinda makes sense, and now i know i should tell people to try and remove any microSD to troubleshoot such issues.

I don't know the details about the steam deck itself, but yes there's a precise order in which things happens during boot and shutdown.

It's also all logged in: if you have set up a password with the passwd command (if you do so, try to not forget it, it can be reset but it's an avoidable hassle) try

`sudo dmesg -T`

It will show you a log with useful Infos on what happened when. (Note: be sure to enter the *minus* sign and not the – that is different from -)

There's another useful command

`journalctl`

It's normal to have *warnings* and everything still runs alright, but if you see errors, and the timestamp is the same as the moment you had issues, you can gather precious clues.",SteamDeck
ji3uc98,"From sudo dmesg -T, I noticed there were lines that say ""efi loader unknown, exiting"" and after that: ""[drm] failed to add display topology, dtm ta is not initialized"".  It also says ""mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.  Opts: (null), quota mode: none.""

With journalctl it says ""sdhci-pci: card stuck in wrong state!  Card_busy_detect status: 0xc00"".  I don't know for sure if it means the sd card there, but cards can be sdhc sd cards, so it could be.
It also says ""Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk0p1 (sd card name), logical block 239608684, lost async page write"" and also says (about the sd card) ""blk_update_request I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 1916871496 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x1000 seg 1-3 (it had errors for each) prio class 0"" above the async write error.  All of those errors repeated many times upon trying to shutdown the steam deck or go into sleep mode.  It seems (to me, from what I could understand), like the processes to write to the sd card were failing because it was deemed busy (possibly), and it would just keep checking the status over and over, attempting to write to it, but couldn't because it was still deemed to be busy.

Extra:
The errors would come in huge groups, sometimes hundreds of lines of just ""card stuck in wrong state"" errors.",SteamDeck

I've refunded the game twice after experiencing the shitty controls. Once when they released 1.0, and the second time after an update where they said they improved controller support--which was a flat-out lie.

jhpywxm,"Okay, so, you've gotta understand a few things about how this all works to mod stuff on the Deck.

Each windows game you run on Deck goes to its own separate sandbox, called a proton prefix. What this means is that just installing MO2 won't work, since it will go into its own prefix that doesn't interact with your Skyrim prefix (or FO4 prefix, or NV prefix, or whatever.) This is because the Deck is not a windows machine, it's a linux one.

Therefore, you can't just install MO2 and expect it to work since there's no linux MO2. Instead, what you need to do is find a way to get MO2 into your game's prefix.

There's a couple ways to do this. Easiest is with steamtinkerlaunch/proton tricks. (Grab protonup-qt from discover store in desktop mode, install protontricks with protonup-qt, run skyrim or whatever with steamtinkerlaunch as your compatibility layer, tap the menu button on the touchscreen, then tap the MO2 button to install MO2). I got MO2 to recognize my skyrim directory and see all my .esms this way, but I haven't had an opportunity to mod it and get it working, and running skyrim asks me to use steam even though I'm on a steamdeck, so it seems like I'll need to install and order all my mods, get them enabled, and then run skyrim through the normal launcher as a workaround instead of just hitting play like I would on MO2 on PC.

You can also try to do it manually by dumping the MO2 exe file into Skyrim (or whatever's) proton prefix, then changing the Skyrim steam game target from skyrim.exe to the installer exe, installing MO2, and then changing the target to the MO2 run exe you installed. I have no idea how well this would work though.

Or you can grab bottles from the discover store and do it all from one bottle",SteamDeck

jhprzmm,I’m actually playing this right now and just ran into this issue. I solved it oddly enough by launching disc 2. It just ran as if it was disc 1.,SteamDeck

And 

https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager/issues/386

Even changed the Glob but it wouldn't launch the game at all in game mode. I gave up on this approach after struggling with this. 


The solution that I figured out was to go to desktop mode and open Dolphin. From there Options > Hotkey Settings. In these settings press and hold the start button, this will switch the deck into Gamepad mode and allow you to edit and setup hotkeys using the steam deck buttons. For me, I set the Change Disc hotkey to left thumb stick + right thumb stick+ left trigger. 

While in game this will open a file select that you will use to select disc 2 for your game. I created a shortcut on my desktop to the roms folder on my sdcard and can quickly select the game disc I need.

On the surface, this seems like an easy Project yet it took me well over 2 months to finish up. 

Let's just say compatibility is life's definition of a joke ! 

Onto the main course:

Here is my wireless play setup. 

This is a wireless HDMI Transmitter/Receiver from the company Peakdo. They're great folks who stand behind their product. They helped me considerably along the way! Kudos! 

So basically you wear the glasses and they wirelessly transmit what your steamdeck shows. 

You may even just use a wireless controller if the deck is too heavy or you'd like more mobility. 

Up to 10 Meters (30ft) from steamdeck to glasses. 

The OLED glasses project the steamdeck screen for about 12 to 13 hours per charge. 

FYI: When purchasing the Peakdo Wireless Transmitter P3s, you only get a transmitter and a receiver. I modded the receiver with a sizeable battery to last well over 12 hours !

Yes OLED steamdeck done! 

Now onto the STEAMDECK mods themselves:

DEVASO Backplate which magnetically houses a 100mm peltier Fan. Ptm7950 on APU and RAM and 3.5mm thick copper plate between the APU and Backplate. 

Silicon Lottery:

CPU 3850/2000 GPU 

(clocks reached while undervolted by -30/-40/-40)

Otherwise without undervolting I easily hit 4100/2200. 

35W TDP

6400mts on Micron RAM

The backplate is similar to Jsaux in principle yet with a 100mm circular aluminum plate as opposed to the rectangular smaller one on Jsaux. 

I only got this to match it with the fan and acheive superior cooling. 

For everything else, the quality on Jsaux is better. 

Temps with my overclock are 70c/71c on Cyberpunk. On less demanding games 61c/59c. 

While idle on home 29c!!!

Smaller touches will be added to get these temps even lower !

People are still in awe of Silent Hill 2 (for example), which came out in 2001.

Hardly anyone thinks back to kernel 2.4 (which also came out in 2001). Not because it sucked so much, but because most everything that came after was better, as progress often goes as far as tech is concerned.

Now does that mean what Valve does is not great or important, certainly not! But they are not the paragons of open source software that one might believe they are after reading your serenade 😉",SteamDeck
jhua5d6,"The kernel is continuously evolving, for Silent Hill what people want is a remaster…",SteamDeck
jhudmmv,"The point is Art does not end up forgotten as you are claiming, but tech certainly is at least replaced (if not outright forgotten).

People will still revere, replay and analyze the original Silent Hill 2 even long after the remake is out.

Nobody will go out of their way to install a distro running 2.4 to re-experience the good old times… not today and not in the future!",SteamDeck
jhio0op,"I never used steam before getting a steam deck, so technically it did change my purchase habits on steam. 

A lot of the games I play are listed as unplayable, but still run just fine. The ranking system that steam uses is pretty lack luster. I completely ignore that rating. 

ProtonDB has much more accurate ratings, and also has tips on how to get a game running well if it doesn't want to work out of the box. You can add proton badges through decky, and it will add a badge on the hero image of the games home page that gives you a good idea about how compatible the game is. The badge can be clicked and it will take you straight to that games listing on ProtonDB, which goes into detail about how well the game runs, and if there are any steps you should take to make it work better.",SteamDeck
jhinp78,"Yes. I'm buying a ton more indie games or games I would not consider, because I'm constantly reading thru Steam Deck game recommendation threads.  For example, Brotato and Vampire Survivor.  
     
Perfect example, there's a post now asking for game recommendations that I will always read thru: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12xdow5/what_games_are_absolutely_perfect_for_the/ 
       
I'm also buying a lot of games that I've already played thru on consoles, just so I can play it on the Steam Deck. Such as GTA V, Fallout 4, RDR2, Bioshock series, Titanfall 2, etc.",SteamDeck
jhitdqs,"I've stopped buying games that require a third party launcher or require a connection to play as much.  
RDR2 handled offline play really well when I tried it. I just warned me that the launcher was offline and proceeded to load the game.

AC3 Remastered on the other hand just required too much effort to try and play offline, so it got refunded.

My rule going forward is that if it requires a third-party launcher that needs to be online I won't buy it until it is on sale for $5",SteamDeck
jhin5n0,"I still buy everything. So sadly it did not change it.
No seriously please help it's getting out of control.",SteamDeck
jhinhfc,Not really! I use Isthereanydeal. To find games I don't have! Fanatical & Humble bundles are my go-to! But I did just complete a recommendation - Pyre & Hades it's in a bundle that's meant to be good on deck.,SteamDeck
jhiori0,"sure does.

If it's on sale, and ""might"" run on steamdeck, I buy it.

my purchases since owning the steamdeck have increased 9001%",SteamDeck
jhitfdn,"Huge difference. I used to buy games wherever I could get them cheapest (steam, epic, ubi store, etc), but now I buy literally everything either directly from steam or from a storefront that redeems on steam. I've even re-purchased more games than I care to mention that I already owned, so I could play and manage them easier within steam.

I also buy way more indie titles than I used to and am now constantly hunting for more good steam deck games.",SteamDeck
jhitnsj,"Yes. I pretty much buy games on a discount. Get sad my backlog is growing. Try to fill the void by buying more games. Get sad again. 

Rinse & repeat",SteamDeck
jhitho5,I purchase a lot more on Steam than I used to. Definitely check compatability first too. Though I will still buy a game that isnt fully compatible. Most of the time it is just something like small fonts or  having to click through the initial setup that keeps it from being deck verified.,SteamDeck
jhitrbz,"It hasn't really changed my purchasing habits as much as it's rearranged them. I play on PC and on Switch, mainly. It used to be a pretty even mix between the two platforms. Now I buy almost everything through Steam and the Switch has been relegated only to exclusives.

Although, as far as PC goes, Steam was always my go-to storefront. I got the huge Itch.io charity bundle in 2020 and a few free games through Epic, but otherwise, my whole library is on Steam.",SteamDeck
jhiudpv,"I do \*steam deck support\* search on the game discussion first before adding to wishlist. 

Some game if I really like it and it is on sale, I will still buy even if there is not SD support cos I will play on my desktop.

But yeah, I now do always first look at the product page for the badge, then go to the discussion and do a search then add to wishlist or decide if I want to buy.",SteamDeck
jhkc4oi,[deleted],SteamDeck
jhio96a,"I buy what I missed out on from xbox one/ps4 but only when those games are on sale

I'm not buying games I've already played on other systems anymore and haven't for a while. It's just wasted time for me considering I've got a lot of games I've not played yet.",SteamDeck
jhit7nw,Technically. I mostly use my Steam Deck for Emulation. However I have bought 4 games for my deck in the span of almost a year. It previously took me about 5 years to purchase 4 games.,SteamDeck
jhj0cbh,"I’m buying more games after getting my deck, but more indies than anything.",SteamDeck
jhj2830,"I used to be relatively agnostic as to what ""store"" I bought my PC games from and just looked at the best price, best sale, grabbed stuff for free via Epic Games store, etc.

&#x200B;

Now I basically only consider Steam games due to the easy integration.  It also opened me up to a different ""type"" of game that I normally wouldn't buy too; I have a gaming PC with an Ultrawide so a lot of these pixel style games and games that are better with controllers I sort of never really played; now I seek them out.",SteamDeck
jhkwulb,"Nah not really. I just play my games a little more. There are some games I do purchase for the deck, that I once would purchase for my xbox controller, which I also still use for some games.

My account is also 19 years old and has 700+ games so I'm kinda 'down there' on possible games I can buy. I'm just happy i've extended my play hours a little bit so I can work on that backlog.",SteamDeck
jhitz6s,"I don't think I've bought anything on Steam since I got mine, other than the new Vampire Survivors DLC.

So.. no.

I *seriously* cut back on buying games on Steam when I realized I was never playing 90% of them.",SteamDeck
jhiu9la,"I’ve been buying more games on Steam for sure, especially smaller titles that don’t have physical console releases",SteamDeck
jhj3spw,"I held off buying games in 2022 so I could afford a Deck in 2023. Now I'm working on my enormous backlog and trying not to buy anything until I've made some progress on the games I already own.

The games on the top of my wishlist will still be there when I'm ready, and they'll probably have better sales when I finally get there.",SteamDeck
jhjdpak,"Stop using Steams verified system, and start using protonDB badges. If its gold/platinum you're good.",SteamDeck
jhjsy4e,I used to buy rpgs on switch if I could so I could play them at lunch. Now I buy a lot of those on pc,SteamDeck
jhkxgjb,My favorite games are deemed unsupported for the deck but they all run fine!,SteamDeck
jhodr7b,"Nope. It hasn’t changed my Steam buying habits. I’ve been using Steam since 2006, I might have bought more titles when I got the Deck in the fall, but wound playing my Ryzen 7 RTX 3060 build instead. If anything, the future of gaming has me concerned when titles like Gotham Knights become super grinding and paywalled.

I think publishers will keep developing PC games for Windows and Valve will be doing to work with Proton to get these games to run. Publishers don’t have much to do for development, Valve does ALL the work. It’s a checkmark at submission, then it’s flagged in Valve’s system to be reviewed and tested. If games were being developed natively for Linux, then it would be a much different story. Also, more Windows portables coming market (such as the ROG Ally), I don’t think anything will change for PC games as Windows first.",SteamDeck
jhkpzki,"Cloud Saves are huge for me. Steam Deck is my only device, and if the game doesn’t have save sync capabilities, I’m probably not even going to bother.",SteamDeck
jhindoj,"Considering I had never used steam, and now I peruse the store daly… Yes it has made a big impact on my habits (and wallet)",SteamDeck
jhiuahb,Nah. I only buy from Steam during the big Sales. But the Deck certainly has me taking another look at all those games I bought and never played.,SteamDeck
jhiubly,"Yes & no, there are some games I'd prefer to experience on pc usually large demanding AAA titles my last 3 that come to mind are TLOU, RE4, and Hogwarts legacy. But I also find myself looking for titles to play in bed now. Some days I prefer gaming in bed other days I'm okay with sitting at my desk but at some point for some reason I'll grab my SD",SteamDeck
jhiubv4,Since it made me get Steam for the first time I’d say a solid yes.,SteamDeck
jhiuoio,"My PC slowly became relatively useless so I went from  buying steam games all the time (especially during sales) to completely stopping unless there was a good strategy game… with the steam deck, I’ve bought prob 50 games since I got it in the fall… I’ll ply 10 of them…",SteamDeck
jhiuyum,Yes i dont buy games anymore and just do emulation,SteamDeck
jhivajg,The Steam Deck didnt change my purchasing habits on steam. It made me start buying games on steam. Lol,SteamDeck
jhivb43,It makes me really want some more in-depth twin stick shooters with progression systems.,SteamDeck
jhivgnm,"Yes, if it's not supported by the deck, it's not supported by me.",SteamDeck
jhivjoo,"Before the Deck, I had a rickety old PC I built between 2013-2015 out of peer pressure as opposed to actually wanting to and didn’t upgrade it since. I used Steam for modded MGSV and an odd and end here and there for the longest time. Was a console gamer otherwise. 

Now here I am, 1TB SSD swap and a 1TB card later trying to consolidate my lifetime library to one spot…",SteamDeck
jhivjv4,"Slowly but surely. I used to not mind tinkering to make games work, but now if it's not one or two easy steps to get a game working I don't bother buying it",SteamDeck
jhivo00,"Yes, I buy far less than before, which probably wasn't that they intended with the 64GB but... I can use games I already own and emulators instead so :D",SteamDeck
jhivzm6,"In the sense that it's got me buying Steam games again since all the way back in 2013, yeah. That's around the time I got my PS4 and pretty much swore off PC gaming completely. Now I'm back to it.",SteamDeck
jhiyfjy,"Yes, I buy everything through Steam now. I used to buy a few games through their respective launchers, but now every purchase is through Steam.

Also, I always check protondb before buying anything now. If it doesn't work on SteamOS, it's a no go for me even though I have Windows installed on my Deck as well. Windows is for Warzone and BF2042, which I play with friends.

I've only bought 3 games (one was a repurchase) since I got my Steam Deck mid-Q3, and have mostly been plowing through backlog.",SteamDeck
jhiykca,I've been buying more games. I used to pirate on my desktop a lot and only bought games for multi-player or if I didn't wanna wait months for it to get cracked but pirating on steam deck can be tricky and sometimes the games just won't work and I'll end up actually buying them.,SteamDeck
jhiyrlj,"Heavy PC Gamer here. Only bought/had the consoles for their exclusives. Not really changed my purchasing habits, only looking somethimes for games that i plan on playing on the SD only. Usually games i can play without sound on the side when I watch something with my wife",SteamDeck
jhiz6r0,"I had a Steam account before getting the deck, and bought games pretty rarely. Now every week I'm looking for deals on something that looks interesting 🤣

It's also opened up the opportunity to find more local CoOp games to play together with my wife and kid on the big TV! Now I also want to buy all the controllers 😂

It has definitely changed my purchasing habits, but I would say in a positive way!",SteamDeck
jhizbre,I've sold all non-exclusive Switch game cartridges and purchased them on steam. I've earned a bit.,SteamDeck
jhiznr1,Yeah I stopped paying for game pass and bought the games on steam,SteamDeck
jhj0ed5,"I don’t pay any attention to “playable” or not games. All my main ones are not considered playable. Conan Exile, GTA V, and recently D2R. 

I buy more games from Steam now though - I also enjoy searching through and adding games to my wishlist",SteamDeck
jhj0wpz,"Slightly. I've always been in the camp of buying shitloads of indie games on PC, so that hasn't changed with the Deck.

Likewise, being cautious about the state of big ticket PC games before buying them has also been a thing long before the Deck was announced. However, the range of the games I do buy has been narrowed - for example, if the port is fine but it's just too intensive or has incompatible anticheat. Those titles are few and far between, though.",SteamDeck
jhj1j96,"Somewhat. I was gaming on Linux before, so I was already checking ProtonDB for compatibility and mainly buying from Steam. Now that the Steam Deck has become my primary gaming device I tend to go for games which work better for the hardware and controls too.",SteamDeck
jhj1tr7,"I have been buying and playing way more indie titles like Ion fury, Dusk, Elderborn, Blasphemous etc. Been absolutely loving them.",SteamDeck
jhj21r1,"Absolutely, I started my journey with SteamDeck and purchase Steam games with Deck compatibility in mind. yet, I'm currently playing Deathloop and No Man Sky on Xbox Game Pass (streaming through MS Edge on Deck). With a strong WiFi connection, this is a great way to try games. Two different environments on one device. Of course emulating is an option too. This tech continues to blow me away.",SteamDeck
jhj2a51,If it’s not gold or better on protondb I don’t even bother anymore,SteamDeck
jhj2toy,"Yeah, it did change my habits a lot. I usually only buy during sales anyway, but I look specifically for Steam Deck playable at least now.",SteamDeck
jhj32h7,"For me, the only thing it's changed is my gaming habits in general, I used to be a chronic CSGO addict, ever since the SteamDeck, I actually play my library of 1500 games; not the full library of course, but I tried 170 games last year, beaten 15 games! Got my first platinum since 2020! 

It kinda helped me have a healthier habit with CSGO, notice now though that if I can play a game on controller, I will play it on controller, and if it's got Cloud Saves, so I can go from PC to Deck and vice versa, if there's no cloud saves, we only install on the Deck and play from there. 

Purchasing habits; only checking for Cloud Save and whether it's unsupported or not, if it's unsupported, check ProtonDB, if truly unsupported, hold off on buying till deep discount. The only unsupported game I've bought was Modern Warfare II 2022 

Last 6 months here are my purchases that I spent my own money on, no bundles:

Persona 5 Royal  
Crysis Remastered 2/3 (Steam Deck not in mind)   
Resident Evil 8 Winter's Expansion  
Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection  
Spider-Man Miles Morales  
Dead Space 2023  
Resident Evil 4 2023  
Sifu   


I've always been a SteamDrone shill for years, but the Deck has given me an even bigger reason to refuse to use other stores, I'm not willing to put up with any headaches from other Storefronts and the Deck has given me an additional reason to never falter since no Cloud Save / Ez Install = no buy. Like Sifu! Could've gotten it cheaper on Epic, but I'd rather pay 10 extra euros for a Steam Installation.",SteamDeck
jhj382k,I had like 60 games. Over the past many years. Now I have more than double that amount. Only because of Steam Deck. But also was possible because of disposable income since I did not have that much before. I am just concerned if I am able to finish most of them...,SteamDeck
jhj3us2,"No not at all, but that's more because I have a good pc for streaming and stream any game that doesn't work to my deck so I don't need to really think about whether it's verified or not.",SteamDeck
jhj46gr,"I didn’t have a steam account before I bought the deck. “Playable” and the other labels, I often ignore those and look on protondb instead.

jhj4gum,No. I still make irresponsible choices.,SteamDeck
jhj4iew,I had recently had gotten some control on my spending on games on sale but now I just want to buy everything.,SteamDeck
jhj4k3n,Yes. I spend more money on games overall.,SteamDeck

jhj4kmw,Nah still buying the games I wanna play. But if it doesn’t run well on steam deck I play then I play on PC,SteamDeck
jhj4mji,Way more indies and less AAA,SteamDeck
jhj4riv,"I've... bought a lot more games... I used to just have a handful of games in my library that all had atleast 400-1000 hrs on them. I now have those games that I mean to play but will likely never... Congratulations Valve, you got me.",SteamDeck
jhj4whq,"I’ve been buying games for it that I would normally get for a home console. 
even thought it would look/play better on the home console, because it’s just so hard to not play it anywhere, even if that just means my backyard.",SteamDeck
jhj5evf,"I've been buying more porn games since getting the deck. Always felt kinda weird to play them on a computer, even though my GF has her own, but SD is just more personal.",SteamDeck
jhj5j79,Yep. I don’t buy games from anywhere except Steam now.,SteamDeck
jhj694u,I definitely look to see if there are launchers now. God I hate those. If a game doesn't have one I'm way more likely to buy,SteamDeck
jhj7riw,I played thousands of hours of rogue likes before I got my deck. Got really burnt out after spending 900+ hours on ROTMG. Never thought I’d pick up another one again. Yet over the past year and a half of having a deck I have bought dozens of rl’s just for the enjoyability of being able to just kick back and have a nice half a hour-hour long session.,SteamDeck
jhj8hq2,"I started buying games on Steam again, after years being console exclusive.",SteamDeck
jhj8obu,Absolutely. I pretty much try to buy everyone on the deck now instead as long it works well.,SteamDeck
jhj8oio,I feel like it made my purchasing habits worse than without it. I feel like I buy at least one game every two weeks to a month depending on price now.,SteamDeck
jhj8s3e,Yes,SteamDeck
jhj96vl,"Yes! In the past Id just buy whatever game I wanted whenever I wanted.

Now I throw games on the wishlist and wait until they reach a price Im willing to pay.

Mostly because there are so many games I want to play on the deck that I have a large backlog now, and am in no rush to purchase more to simply add to the backlog - can afford to be patient :)",SteamDeck
jhj9guk,It did 100% what the Steam Deck was intended to do by being sold at a low cost as a lead item: make me buy more game on Steam. My library used to be a total of seven games. Now it's nearly double that.,SteamDeck
jhjbln6,Yes. I'm buying even more games that I'll not have time to play.,SteamDeck
jhjc2bo,I guess it has made me rebuy some older games or actually purchase some Gamepass games because I feel they would be great on the go or want to replay them but not in a traditional way on the PC or TV/console.,SteamDeck
jhjcbhu,"Yes, I'll buy more controller-centric games now, even if I end up playing them with my Xbox controller at my desk, and sometimes on my Steam Deck.

jhjd20p,"When I initially got my Steam Deck I hadn't logged into my account since shortly after Half Life 2 launched. I also played some Counter Strike Source when it first launched. 

Now I am buried in games I bought on sale. Since August I have bought over a hundred games that I will totally get around to playing.",SteamDeck
jhjejdt,"I barely bought games before my Steam Deck and I still don't. Only games I bought after it was the rest of the valve complete collection and briefly skyrim special edition which I returned since I decided just to use the original version. And the valve complete collection wasn't even because of the Steam Deck.

I just don't wanna buy too many games when I still have several other games I have yet to complete. Although I did consider getting beamng.drive just to have fun driving around whenever I wanted but decided against it for now.",SteamDeck
jhjfg9h,"Yes and no for me. I have a full-force gaming PC that I do my main gaming on like COD, BF, etc however when games go on sale with the Steam Sales when I'm looking then ill see if they are SD compatible, if they aren't I just move right along because those are games I will probably never play on my main PC.",SteamDeck
jhjfp5v,I've spent more money on steam haha,SteamDeck
jhjfx7l,"Yes, in an odd way. I have previously used Steam sometimes to pick up old games I could run on my laptop and occasionally games that were on sale that I couldn't play at the time but figured I would ether upgrade my to a PC or time would win out next for another laptop. 

Now I have no excuses to buy and wait, I can play things now I've had on Steam for almost a decade so I have been slowly going through my backlog, whether new experiences or replaying old favorites, Vanquish and Fable as of late. It's just been hard to justify anything really new when I have 200+ games to go through.",SteamDeck
jhjh2wm,"I’ve always preferred to buy games that launch from Steam over other launchers, even if another launcher still runs from Steam. But the last few years I started being more open to just run games from other launchers. Got tired of paying the Steam tax. 

Since getting the Deck I’m back to preferring games that can launch from Steam. I’m not that into tinkering or going into Desktop mode so I’d rather just be able to manage games from Steam.

I do have the Blizzard launcher installed as well as Minecraft and Roblox so I’m willing to do it I just prefer not to.",SteamDeck
jhjhdui,"This is going to sound heretical, but it's actually gotten me to buy more Switch games. Not for an emulator, just for the Switch proper.

The Deck has made me realize that the convenience of a handheld is very valuable, more valuable than max graphics or 165fps.

So I play a lot of Steam games, but also play a lot of Switch games. It works out great because in a strangely un-Nintendo move they allow developers to sell digital keys places other than the eShop, so you can get games that are Steam-cheap. dekudeals.com helps find them. Don't get me wrong, I also buy and play more Steam games than before. isthereanydeal.com helps find those.

So yeah I buy more Steam games than before, but I also have become much more receptive to handheld ""low spec"" gaming in general. I used to get hung up on ""can I run the game at max? do I have to use DLSS? let me pull up afterburner and..."" and now I just think ""can I play the game?"" and that's good enough.",SteamDeck

I mostly play potato games (and my gaming PC is from 2015, so the top of the line games I was rocking back then might be potato tier these days ;\_; ), so any games I buy are almost guaranteed to work on Deck. I do think that new Steam games should make an effort to be Deck compatible, although I'm not sure how realistic that is. I bought Hogwarts Legacy on Steam because I saw it was Deck verified, but I didn't enjoy how it ran at all. Even tried connecting it to my dock to play it on my big TV like a console and what looked iffy on the actual Deck's screen looked a million times worse on the TV where I'm regularly playing my media in 4K.",SteamDeck
jhjjp3s,"Yes, now I only look for deck verified games to buy",SteamDeck

jhjs7j1,"Yes, because the Steam Deck is currently my main gaming device/the only device on which I can access most of my Steam games. My gaming PC has served admirably, but has reached the end of its gaming career (it can stream games on GFN, but that's about it), and I don't have the time, energy, or budget to build a new one.

How playable something is on Deck is a huge factor in whether I purchase, and I try to look closely at not only how playable it is on Steam or ProtonDB, but also in what ways it is or is not playable.",SteamDeck

jhjthdi,">Has the deck changed your purchasing habits?

Not at all. The Steam deck is only a companion to my PCs.

>What do you think this means for the future of game publishers that don't make any effort to make a game playable on the deck?

Until the Deck becomes a huge player on the market, nothing. As far as I can tell, 3 million units have been sold so far. Over 60 million people use Steam on a daily basis.",SteamDeck

I still primarily play on PC, and just have my Deck so I can play games while traveling. So I doubt my purchasing habits will change much, though that ""Steam Deck Verified"" stamp will probably sway me when I'm on the fence about buying a new game.",SteamDeck
jhkawoo,I stopped buying because the steam deck is allowing me to tackle my backlog! Which is a good thing,SteamDeck
jhke5w8,"Yes, Prior I would shop around various launchers for the best sale / price.

Now almost exclusively Steam",SteamDeck
jhke65j,Yes it made me spend more money,SteamDeck
jhke6bk,"Yes it has, I don't purchase on deck since my gift purchase was for my spouse but was sent to a friend instead so yeah not buying anything on the device again",SteamDeck
jhkemxa,Nope if I wanna play it I buy it. So far everything has worked outside of changing proton versions on niche situations. Proton 8.0 here now though so maybe that'll be less a problem.,SteamDeck
jhkeqvk,"Not really. I do like to check how the games I buy run on Deck, but I don't rule out a game if it doesn't work.

That said, I'm experimenting with daily driving Linux on my desktop PC, so general Linux compatibility will matter more to me as I get more comfortable with it.",SteamDeck
jhkff4q,Very much so. It has been the tipping point to fully shift my game buying to 100% PC only.,SteamDeck
jhkfplc,"I kept buying games in my wishlist that went on sale, but ended up not playing them 😂",SteamDeck
jhkfrrn,"I went from no computer, and 7 games on Steam from 10 years ago. Now I’m about to hit 90 games since being gifted a SD in January…",SteamDeck
jhkfzd5,I have definitely purchased more games. Especially once they are on sale. And I can also say that the games are more fit for steam deck which in my case means I play for 20 to 40 minutes and then come back later or the next day where I left off.,SteamDeck
jhkgnqx,I buy less now,SteamDeck
jhkgun2,[Grogu says Yesss](https://tenor.com/YSQyopzOjP.gif),SteamDeck
jhkit0d,It’s lead me to the brink of divorce. My husband said that I can’t buy any more games for awhile,SteamDeck
jhkj8dr,The switch was my main gaming console so it definitely changed my buying habits! I haven’t bought any switch games since I got my steam deck in March. I’ve bought a few games I always wanted to play but mostly I’ve been getting games through fanatical and humble bundle deals. I’m also playing a lot more gamepass games so it feels like I’m getting my moneys worth.,SteamDeck
jhkjr2o,"In the last few years I only purchased games for playstation but not for steam. For steam I had older games, eg. Old strategy games, and I usually bought very cheap games. Since I have the steam deck, Ive looked for more.indie games and platformers as I use it for mainly that purpose",SteamDeck
jhkk5y6,Yeah most games I get repacked are now being purchased if they're enjoyable and run on the steam deck. I know windows is a thing but the user friendly-ness of the stream deck in general makes me just straight up buy them so I can play them in bed.,SteamDeck
jhkk6ot,"Totally changed it.  I hadn't bough a game on Steam in 18 months.  Since getting the deck, it is almost the only place I will buy a game.  And if it isn't playable on the deck, I am not interested.

As such, I no longer pre-order much because I want to make sure the game will be compatible on the deck.",SteamDeck
jhkm4d8,"Erm, just a little.

Like many others I had a steam account and a couple of free games in my library, none i had ever actually played. PC gaming, I just couldn't get into it 

Roll onto buying the deck and my library now stands at 179 games. Ok, some have been codes bought thru cheaper 3rd parties (humble, cdkeys, greenman), but valve have definitely recouped their loss leading hardware with my software purchases! Am I upset....far from it. It's reopened gaming up for me and brought new adventures together for my son and I playing together!",SteamDeck
jhkmaa0,"Nope. Still follow the ""isthereanydeals"" lowest price ever. I think I'm grow old n still use the website for alerts when prices hit all time low",SteamDeck
jhkmu9m,"Not really. Most of the games that aren't compatible are from companies I had already been boycotting for years, anyway.",SteamDeck
jhknlhm,"It's definitely shifted which platform I want to buy from. Like I'd pay more for a steam game than I would for the same game on GoG and I'm also more tempted to re-buy games I already have on other PC stores if they're cheap enough. (yes you can play GoG games on deck, but getting them straight from steam is often much easier)",SteamDeck
jhkor9q,"I've been buying old games & trying to make them work. Currently, I'm playing XII, which is ""unsupported,"" yet plays better than Far Cry.

It's perfect for nostalgia. That's been quite a change, b/c I used to mostly stick to new-ish games. (Stuff that's just old enough to be on sale.)",SteamDeck
jhkp0w3,"I mainly bought it as a backlog destroyer and it’s doing that quite well for me. I also moved any game that was on Switch and steam off my switch wishlist and onto my steam wishlist because I mostly play games portably and would have have them on steamdeck 

So for sure it’s shifted some sales to steam/pc. 

But I haven’t increased the amount of games I buy or the type really (although I wouldn’t have bought vampire survivors had I not seen it on here, that’s really the only one though)",SteamDeck
jhkpvtz,I find myself purchasing Steam games much more often after having a SD. The fact that you can play great games that are under $10 on the go is great.,SteamDeck
jhkq48v,"Just a bit. Got a few side scrollers on big sales, that's about it. Rest of my installed games are from existing library. I've cooled off from Steam shopping for a few months. Clearing out my backlog the best I can before D4 is out. Actually, D4 coming out soon made me shop less. Actually, I got my Deck mostly so I can play D4.",SteamDeck
jhkq9o5,Not at all. I almost exclusively use desktop mode. I just play what I want.,SteamDeck
jhks8xb,"Yes. It has encouraged me to purchase games that I otherwise would never have been able to play before owning a deck due to hardware limitations and affordability.

I've also purchased games/dlc for friends so we can play together, and the favors are reciprocated when they buy a game for me to play together with them! 

Definitely a bigger sense of community, which makes me want to continue purchasing titles to play together with friends.",SteamDeck
jhkt63l,Yeah buying a lot more older and indie titles now when before I used to just pirate them (allegedly) cause I don’t know how to remove viruses from Linux,SteamDeck
jhkttrf,I'm more likely to get a game on steam than playstation but that's about it,SteamDeck
jhktwdc,"Prior to my Deck, I owned Stardew Valley on Steam.

That’s… that’s it. I’ve always been a console gamer. 

Now I understand why my friends look forward to Steam sales with trepidation…",SteamDeck
jhktwzr,"Yeah for the worst 😞

My backlog is a eternal black hole.",SteamDeck
jhkuao0,i buy more games because of the steam deck but i also play more games because of the steam deck,SteamDeck
jhkuv4a,I actually buy games now.,SteamDeck
jhkwx99,"Definately looking at more cozy games, farming sim, tactics games, hell i even glanced at a visual novel game.",SteamDeck
jhkwzxk,I only buy games playable on the deck because nVidia's bullshit over the last 3 years led me to console gaming and never desktop PC again.,SteamDeck
jhkx0fz,"It has made me really get into rouge-lite or rouge-likes, never sure what they are actually called since more simple quick play games have peaked my gaming interests with the Steam deck. My current favorite is one called Undermine.",SteamDeck
jhkxktn,"Not yet, I have a bunch of games that haven't played a ton that I'm finally playing on deck. But it will change how I play games, some games I'll want to save to play on deck (ie. Dredge) or only want to play it on my PC (ie. Jedi survivor when it comes out) Mostly for graphics and 60fps sensitivity",SteamDeck
jhkyrpi,"Yes. Before the deck I purchased a total of 0 things from steam. I am now at 120 games and I only thing I’m really playing at all is Genshin on my phone, so my priorities are not in the right place.",SteamDeck
jhkyubw,"Used Steam since its inception, but hardly used it over the years since I mostly played WoW/D3. Now I purchase games exclusively on Steam because of my Deck (even spending more). Epic isn't a great store, but they do have some great offers on from time to time.",SteamDeck
jhkz3ju,"I only buy playable and above, but then again I never use our laptop at home for hardly anything and I have an old Mac that bairly loads anymore. In fact, I'm not sure it even works anymore because I haven't used it in at least 5 years.",SteamDeck
jhkzlnt,"No,  I'm still an absolute mess with no ceiling on my gaming budget.",SteamDeck
jhkzypb,"Nope. Still have 848 titles with 11% played and a completion rate of 0.04% 

I buy games thinking I'll get around to playing them only to never launch any. 

I need help! 🥹",SteamDeck
jhl0hfp,Nah i still buy every game i see on sale lol,SteamDeck
jhl0inj,Steam Deck converted me from a pirate crew to the 'let's wait for this game to be 15 dollars in two years' crew.,SteamDeck
jhl1s26,"Absolutely. Instead of me spending $5 - $25 randomly on clash of clans and other mobile apps, I’m now spending it on random steam sale games that I’ll install and play for 5 minutes then probably never play again. 

Thanks Steam 🫡",SteamDeck
jhl1y86,I usually wait for games I know I'll play for hours to go on the Switch so I can play it handheld but now I just buy it since I have the steam deck.,SteamDeck
jhl20k6,It'd caused me to purchase more things from steam.,SteamDeck
jhl263d,"I've bought a few games that I already own, free from other stores. Some I have played and love, but now want to play on the go. And others that I never did play, but see mobile as the perfect platform for them. It's also got me buying and playing more side scrollers, since on the PC I usually prefer to play a big AAA title. But I don't enjoy them as much on the deck, even if they run perfectly, so the side scrollers have been just right.",SteamDeck
jhl2bxi,Yes.  I sold all my consoles and use steam deck exclusively.,SteamDeck
jhl2equ,Went from owning legacy rocket league & 5-6 games (ran them of a surface pro 4) to now which incompasses 84 games.,SteamDeck
jhl2v43,"The biggest thing is that I will no longer get any game on any other launcher. I used to not really care that much, especially if it was an offline game. But now, there have already been several occasions where I paid more specifically to get a game on steam instead of Epic or Origin",SteamDeck
jhl3h9c,"YES. I got around one game every few months before getting the Steam deck, and one every two weeks or so after.",SteamDeck
jhl49lk,I definitely had a burst of purchases at the beginning. But it didn't last... there are only so many games that I even want to own.,SteamDeck
jhl62hb,"So many people saying they'd rather have a steam copy even if it costs more SMH.

I'd rather have a GOG copy than a steam copy... Though to an extent the steam deck has changed my mentality in that I do wish I had easier access to certain steam features (streaming & input mapping) for games I downloaded with heroic. I also wish heroic launcher had playability status sync since right now I have to manually cross check verified status.

But I'm wondering if the experience on windows will be better or worse than SteamOS. Like what specific advantages does SteamOS bring? I should probably make that a separate post though...",SteamDeck
jhl6t9v,"Yes, they tricked me into buying games when I usually wouldn't",SteamDeck
jhl7089,"I actually found myself purchasing more ""playable"" or even ""unsupported"" games then verified ones. Lately I've been playing a lot of Skul, which is classed as unsupported, but has absolutely zero issues",SteamDeck
jhl8gpq,"Oh absolutely. So many games I have purchased in the last 6 months, completely dictated by ""oh this would be good on the deck""",SteamDeck
jhl979i,"My purchases didn't increase until maybe a month later after owning the Deck. I thankfully had a small backlog of games I could play from the start that was supported. I did install some unsupported games like Star Trek Online. And now my purchases is maybe twice every other month. 

For those saying they've paid more on the steam storefront, I hear you loud and clear but there is a way around it.

https://www.greenmangaming.com/

https://www.fanatical.com/en/

These are where I buy my steam games and they're loads cheaper than going straight to the steam store.",SteamDeck
jhlbbym,"Not really, no. Quite frankly, I simply don't buy many games anymore unless it really is something that I've been looking forward to for a while. I did buy Diablo 2 Remastered on sale, but that's just cause it's on sale. BTW works fine on the deck, albeit a little small.",SteamDeck
jhldefv,"I have purchased more games since I bought the Deck than I have in the past 3 years. Indie games have really taken over my playing as well. 

I consistently check to see if a game is verified or I check ProtonDB. I’ve been playing PC games for 15 years and I feel like I’ve had an awakening in my gaming, especially because I have 3 kids and have a hard time finding time to play games. Now I can play in bed with no worries even if I’m a bit tired.",SteamDeck
jhlh7o1,I hadn't use steam in years since I stopped using my old tower so they definitely seen more from me,SteamDeck
jhlhcxo,"It did. I bought that drift car game, and I suck at it. I'm still trying to get why it is overwhelmed positive",SteamDeck
jhlmp0o,It changed mine as I only buy games that work on the steam deck now while I never worried about that specifically before.,SteamDeck
jhlo23d,Yes in one way now i always scroll down (on the mobile app which works more often than the store on SteamDeck) to check the steam deck compatibility even before I download free stuff,SteamDeck
jhlq0n1,"nothing about SD though, but ever since regional price keep going up, i rarely buy much these days

what's with using 40% of my montly salary just to buy a new AAA games?? fck that",SteamDeck
jhlsut3,"Steam Deck was my introduction to the PC ecosystem. I own two games on my Series X (Infinite, Yakuza 0), I now own 300+ games on Steam. PC games are cheap and bundles are literal crack 

I also only buy games for the Steam launcher - Gog and Epic don't have shader caches and cloud saves through Heroic.",SteamDeck
jhlsvlu,"Had a steam account for 15+ years and owned about 80 games. Mostly a console gamer. 
Bought a deck last fall and now at 400+ games, all through bundles and sales. 

Don’t think I’ve ever spent more than 25 bucks on a single game. 90 percent of purchases have been under 5 bucks. Insane value. Really makes you question the subscription model pushed by the corporate bohemoths. Yeah I know you don’t “own” steam games but at least they don’t rotate out as quickly as games on gamepass or ps plus.

If Valve manage to boost the battery life and OLED the screen on the next go around, it’ll be the perfect handheld system. I’m never gonna expect top of the line graphics performance from a handled, there are home consoles for that.",SteamDeck
jhlt6rs,"I'm now less likely too buy games and splurge on sales actually. The Steam Deck motivated me to get through the backlog of unplayed games from past sales.
Meanwhile, Humble Choice is accumulating a massive library to get through also.",SteamDeck
jhltzl2,I've found that it's changed my purchasing habits in that I buy some games specifically to play on the Steam Deck. I don't really play the same games on the Steam Deck that I do on PC.,SteamDeck
jhlvkn5,"Yes and no.

When I had a working PC, I would window shop often on Steam, and if a sale were to hit and I had the scratch, I'd take it.

The only change with Deck is I'm eyeballing on what is or isn't supported. For example, when I got the Deck, I updated my wishlist by adding the Halo MCC. When the Spring Sale dropped I noticed the ""Unsupported"" icon. Looked into it and come to find my deal breaker that the Anti-Cheat system MCC bared wouldn't recognize Proton almost guarantee ban from Multiplayer by absolute no reason. Luckily a recent patch hit MCC which now makes the Multiplayer playable on Deck.

The point however is I'm careful as to what games can actually be played on Deck with little to no issues. Although now that I think about it, I did much of the same with my old PC, finding out if games can or can't run so... huh perhaps nothing really changed after all.",SteamDeck
jhlvtk2,Definitely grabbing more indies than I was before that’s for sure.,SteamDeck
jhlvz43,"I generally make it a rule not to buy new games if my backlog is a certain size, and to always wait for sales. I’ve saved money and played all of the games in my library with this approach. I’m really happy about it.",SteamDeck
jhlwkep,"Yes, enough said!",SteamDeck
jhm0j2j,"I am buying more action games. I don't have a great setup for a controlled on my pc, and keyboard/mouse doesn't work as well for a lot of these games.",SteamDeck
jhm0wqw,Yes. In the sense that I buy a crap load more games from steam now. Love my steam deck and love what it has done for gaming on Linux.,SteamDeck
jhm146o,Yes I was saving for a psvr 2 and I have wasn't 450 bucks on games in 4  months.,SteamDeck
jhm2pco,"I’ve had a Steam account since beta, really only had it for CS and have probably bought 4 games in 20 years. I’ve probably have purchased 20 games since getting my Deck 8 months ago",SteamDeck
jhm3w70,Nope. My tower is still my darling and focus of the entire operation that is my household for the most part. I absolutely love streaming heavy stuff to the deck though and if something low powered looks good I'll play it natively on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhm6stn,"Most definitely. Before I only played COD4 Modern Warfare on a 2011 MacBook for literally like 14 years. Since I got the deck I’ve purchased and played Outer Wilds, Disco Elysium, Elden Ring, Hades, GTA V, among others. It has been “game changing.”",SteamDeck
jhm705g,"I don't do pc gaming so never owned any of the games. After having the deck, i did a massive purchase of games I always wanted to play. Now sitting at 8 games in just 3 weeks. Playing Elden Ring at the moment and loving it.",SteamDeck
jhm7au7,"I didn't buy a whole lot of games outside of the steam store to begin with, but the steam deck basically locked me into the steam store. It's great when it all works flawlessly, and that's something I've come to expect from valve. If it doesn't, all I gotta do is let uncle gaben know and he refunds me. I'm really impressed with valve/steam",SteamDeck
jhm85p7,Aloha has this happened when you purchased a game and you didn’t like it or didn’t work the game did you get a refund?,SteamDeck
jhm93ks,"Well, I have every single valve-released game in steam now, so there’s that",SteamDeck
jhm9e1i,"As someone who's not into sitting in front of a desktop to play a big game, buying the steam deck made me want to look into more AAA games, just by having the ability to play them in any position.

Of course, indie games aren't safe from my clutches either. Having my first handheld ignited my lost passion for metroidvania games. (Didn't like the switch so I didn't buy it)",SteamDeck
jhmarar,"Had my Steam Deck for about 3 weeks. Even though I have a XSX, Switch, and a PS5, I'm really thinking of getting most of my games in the future from Steam that are playable on the SD. I've found myself playing through more games from my back log, especially now that I don't have to sit in front of my PC/TV to play and so far I've had a pretty good experience. And knowing that I can simply play them in my PC to is great.

For Ex, was going to get No Man's Sky for the XSX but now I'm going to get it from Steam and play/level up on the SD and on my PC.

As long as the games run well I'll be playing them on the SD.",SteamDeck
jhmbdxc,"I bought things that I wouldn’t had considered buying otherwise, so yes.",SteamDeck
jhmeb7l,"Yep. Currently I basically go for console-friendly/like games. Games that play well without keyboard & mouse. Prior to the Deck, y went to more desktop-friendly games, as that was my main gaming platform.",SteamDeck
jhmfckn,Yes I’ve spent way more,SteamDeck
jhmfu0g,Yes,SteamDeck
jhmjcpd,No.,SteamDeck
jhmjfur,I buy now less games but play them to get 100% now,SteamDeck

jhmn12o,"I don’t buy a game if it’s not at least playable on the steam deck, personally.",SteamDeck

jhmp3av,"Sort of, I do try to ensure its steam deck compatible",SteamDeck
jhmpr49,"It absolutely has! I was always a sucker for AAA titles and that's all I played. Since buying the deck I've been getting into indie and metroidvania games. At the minute, I'm obsessed with Dead Cells, it reminds me a lot of the old Castlevania games I played as a kid on the GBA. I never would have been interested in something like that on the PC.

I'm playing a lot of old games on it too like the original Devil May Cry trilogy and Half-life.",SteamDeck
jhmsbmf,"No, but it has justified a lot of them.",SteamDeck
jhmtgt4,"I don’t really think it means anything for game publishers in the future, if a company is developing a FPS shooter their targeted crowd isn’t steamdeck",SteamDeck
jhmuf09,"I didn’t buy very many indie games on my PC mainly because a lot of those games don’t feel like something I would want to sit at a desk and play but since getting a SD, the majority of new purchases are smaller indie games",SteamDeck
jhmvimx,"Well it's certainly stopped me buying so many Switch games & has also stopped me double dipping on games.

I was absolutely going to wait for the next iteration of the Deck due to the tepid launch, but I gave in & got one from Valve a few weeks ago as I realised my dumb ass has spent close to the cost of a Steam Deck on buying the same games on both... that and - more importantly - Valve have finally got Deck OS etc in a good state (& made a few minor hardware upgrades) 

Switch is now all but purely for exclusives. And christ it really does have some belters for JRPGS & Nintendo absolutely smash everyone for their exclusives whixh you can play with everyone.

I have one major gripe with the Deck. Why the hell do we only have one USBc port!? I use headphones that need a Dac/Amp which of course connects via UBSc and there are of course other reasons for it.

I only play at home and yes, although now thanks to this sub there is a solution... there really shouldn't have needed to be one",SteamDeck
jhmvso9,I’ve started looking to buy games that support Steam Cloud to enjoy the switch between my Deck and Desktop.,SteamDeck
jhmwfir,"Not really, I gave up on windows once they rolled-out 10 (linux sysadmin/user since 2002 but was gaming on 2000/xp/7 until then)

Although I tend to purchase more 16:9 and controller-friendly games for the deck now, I hate 16:9 on my UW desktop monitor (like ace combat 7)

Older games I also find more enjoyable on a 7"", also pixel art games look nicer, celeste on 3440x1440p is super blocky",SteamDeck
jhmwo9f,I buy less now because I'm actually playing finishing my backlog. Suspend puts me directly in the game. No opportunity to get distracted by the shop.,SteamDeck
jhmwocm,I would say so. Now I prefer to wait for the release of some games on Steam instead of buying them from the Epic store,SteamDeck
jhmwvya,Definitely not. Not buying only for SD,SteamDeck
jhmy4ci,"Absolutely not. I am a steam user and a gaming pc owner for pretty long, but I still have a huge backlog. I dont let the steam deck to dictate my purchasing habits, just bcuz sometimes im using the deck instead of my pc. Anyway, I got the deck with the intention to finally destroy my backlog and to play less graphics intensive, or older games and/or games that i wouldnt really play on my main rig. I am not particularly bothered if there are some games that dont run on the deck (there are pretty few to be fair), i can always play them on my pc.

 dont think the deck will have a big impact on the future of game publishers who doesnt support the deck, since the exclusive deck users are pretty marginal on the market. But i dont find it unimaginable that good sell numbers wont motivate them to optimize their games a bit better for this device.",SteamDeck
jhmz86r,"Yeah, if I see I game I believe would work well for me with deck controls on sale, I'm probably gonna get it",SteamDeck
jhmzrhz,"Well, as father of 3 kids, I thought, my gaming days were over since 2014.
Had no place for the gaming PC, no money for consoles and a Mac as work laptop.

So I bought the occasional Game that was playable on Mac (like my all-time favorite civ vi) and played some.

With the steamdeck I am now able to catch up on nearly all the games that I was not able to play in the last 10 years, all these AAA-Games.

But of course, I am playing civ vi on the deck right now ;-)",SteamDeck
jhn0aw2,yes,SteamDeck
jhn0ocb,"Before buying Deck in January I had only 4 games on my account. Now I have ≈60, all are paid

All are at least playable, but it's not the main factor, because all games I wanted were already optimized for Deck",SteamDeck
jhn1ce5,I am definitely buying way more games than i used to! These games are on steam only and if i have a game like need for speed heat on the ea app i will buy it again on steam simply to avoid needing to install and run these games from another launcher…. Yes i use other launchers like battle net but only because they are not on steam at all. Every game i buy since (buying)  the deck is verified prior on proton db and i don’t mind slight tuning but i try and keep my experience as simple as possible. I have also been gaming way way more than before! For me the deck is a game changer and although i was an intense pc gamer before i now never use my pc’s and only use the deck because of the sleep mode it has! I used to pirate a lot of games but now i pay them for the simplicity of downloading them thru steam and cloud saved. A big win for Gabe for sure!,SteamDeck
jhn3g3e,"Definitely. Before getting Switch and then Steam Deck I had never reached for the so called ""small games"" as well as 2d platformers or metroidvania type games. It's all changed now and I find those games pretty cozy on my Deck :)",SteamDeck
jhn4chl,"Never used it before I bought it, still haven't bought anything.",SteamDeck
jhn5r54,I'm now broke....Does that answer your question?,SteamDeck
jhn5w0w,I have been buying even more games and I just buy any game I want and hope it works with the 12 different versions of proton I have. I have over 300 games and almost all work expect for games that need EAC 😊,SteamDeck
jhn9l0r,"Yes, and I don’t own a deck yet!

Planning to in the summer and I have found when purchasing I am favouring Steam, even if a game is cheaper on GOG or Epic

I won’t lie, I do worry that if the Deck becomes the default handheld PC, it may impact competition and I would love to see GOG and Epic look to support it, simply so that we consumers have more choice, but it’s up to them really in that regards I guess

I am also building up a catalogue of older/indie games, simply because, I missed out on them back when they first came out and I will get more chance to play them on Deck provided they are verified on PhotonDB

Like I didn’t have a PC that could run X-Wing at the time it came out way back when, but for a few quid I added that whole series to my PC and I am gonna have fun playing that on the Deck",SteamDeck
jhnazy1,"Yes.

Before Deck I used to buy only during sales, but I don't have strict preferences on my games, just look what is there and buy if looks interesting for me. Since Deck, I try to look things I really want to play (this is also because I already own a HUGE library), and I always check if it's playable on Deck, not only verified but if the experience will be satisfactory.

Sometimes I even look throught the ""Perfect for Steam Deck"" collection on Steam...",SteamDeck
jhnc9wu,"i've played some games here and there that arent considered compatible and i gotta say a lot of peoples complaints that might make a game seem unplayable are superficial and dumb. a lot of them run great regardless of controls. so most of the time i see no issue with the game as a whole. and if you do move it to be not compatible, people should make more of an effort to make it compatible and do more thorough testing for steam deck specifically. i'm playing red dead redemption 2 as i bought it on sale a few weeks ago and while i love the game and it is considered playable, it definitely is not perfect. i feel its even worse than if i played it on high end pc personally. it was def not tested enough and is super glitchy but i love the game regardless. its fun enough that even with the crashes, the glitches, the pop in, its still a good game. i'd love to try out pc exclusive game though but most dont catch my interest enough lol",SteamDeck
jhnev8h,Yes.,SteamDeck
jhnhr6k,"I rarely bought games unless it was a game I knew I wanted and was made aware of it outside of steam.

Now sometimes I turn on my deck and just browse the store wishlisting stuff to buy later.

Bought hades the other day haven't put it down since and I honestly don't think I'd ever would have if I didn't have the deck",SteamDeck
jhnmvyo,I'm buying more indie games/visual novels. I always liked them but it was uncomfortable for me to sit for an excessive amount of time next to my computer and just read/play turn-based gameplay but now I'm able to do it in my bed/on the way to work.,SteamDeck
jhnpaoh,Yep. Now I check to see if a game is compatible with Steam Deck.,SteamDeck

I have also shifted my dollars from buying physical releases for consoles to buying for the Steam Deck. When I decided to buy a SD, I decided to shift from bring a physical release collector to going back to being a gamer.

jhn48lu,"> I never used steam before getting a steam deck, so technically it did change my purchase habits on steam.

Haha, pretty much the same. If we count *free* games I think I had about 11 on Steam. But if we only count monetary purchases, there were maybe 4? Of course, I had a pretty old PC: it met the min req for the *original* Skyrim release but not Special Edition, if that gives a good indication of its specs. I mostly used it for Endless Sky and Scrap Mechanic's creative mode (survival mode was a bit too choppy), and the rest of my gaming was on my PS4 (and earlier consoles; I like to collect).

Anyways, I got my 512GB Deck in September, and in the 7 months I've owned it, I've spent more than the system's price on games for it. It is my most powerful PC (and possibly my most powerful console as well, though I hear it only *slightly* wins out over the PS4).",SteamDeck

jhiv654,"It isn't necessarily a bad ranking system, the problem seems to be that it is a monumental task for them to take on and keep their ranking up to date. If a patch is introduced into a game, it can break something and cause a game that was previously fully functional turn into one that simply can't launch. So they would need testers to retest every game that updates. Since valve has a limited number of employees available to do this testing, it makes it easy to miss such an update or just be slow to respond to it. 

Since ProtonDB is open to all of us to report our findings on, they have a lot more people available to do the testing, and even find the fixes needed if it doesn't run. This speeds up the process and keeps things up to date much better, with more accurate info.",SteamDeck

jhjg11f,"I don't think it's a bad ranking system, I'd say that it's just overly cautious about any potential hiccups the game might have on steam deck. The way I see it, for something to be completely 'steam deck verified' it must play in a way that a console gamer would expect on a handheld gaming console. This means all the UI scales automatically to the size of the screen, that the default graphics settings perform very well, and that any prompt for text input, account sign-ins etc are as seamless as possible. If a game lacks just one of these aspects, then it's not 'verified'. It doesn't mean the game isn't playable! It just means that the experience will rely on the user getting past some tweaks to settings or some awkward text input.It's clear that Valve really wants to reach audiences that have never played games on PC before, and a great way to make the steam deck experience feel familiar is by advertising the games that are the closest to the console experience.

I know many avid console gamers that are not very techie people and having to remember how to manually invoke the on-screen keyboard, or tweak graphics settings is a legitimate challenge to them. This is not something they expect to encounter on mainstream gaming consoles, as all those games are delivered specifically for that system, and not just PCs in general.",SteamDeck

Don't go buying a VR headset to play with the Deck. It will not work. At least not in a way that someone would use to describe VR gaming.

VR gaming is much more computationally intensive than regular gaming. The PC has to do double the work because it has to render a separate image for each eye and it has to deliver that at at least 60 fps. For a Quest 2 better 90 fps. Even the Quest 1 needs at least 72 fps. And those frames have to be delivered without any microstutters. Otherwise you will get motion sickness.

The Deck sometimes can't even push 30 fps at 1280x800. Don't try to force it to do something it was never designed to do.

If you want to just play VR games without a PC get a Quest. Its games are tailor made to run on the device itself. They don't look as good as their PC counterparts, but it's good enough.",SteamDeck

You'll be able to get some games to work okay (examples can be found around this thread), but there is never going to be a future in which Valve is going to be able to make any substantial games work with the Steam Deck.  Modders may do additional work to get some more games to that point, but that will be the extent.

Valve is working on a new VR helmet that supposedly will have wireless capability (and potentially a slimmer version that doesn't? it's all still pretty hidden).  That's where any and all efforts to get VR to work are going to go.  They have no plans on getting VR games to work with SD specifically, but instead are working on VR with Proton in general which may happen to help run some things on Deck.",SteamDeck

jhlpmo8,"> Komodo in comparison is selling it at the price Valve advertised, so I assume that Valve essentially paid Komodo to be their retailer in Japan instead.

Japan has all kinds of consumer protections and regulations, so it isn't the easiest to sell stuff in Japan without fully setting up a company in Japan to provide support and all the various paperwork required. So what ends up happening is you have local Japanese companies which contract with the manufacturers to be their local distributor and reseller taking care of all the local requirements, usually with a very healthy markup.

Very famously in Japan a company called ASK has an exclusive contract for import and distribution of graphics cards, leading to ridiculous pricing in Japan far above the cost of you just buying a graphics card overseas and shipping it to Japan yourself.

You can configure controller Desktop configuration to make it more confortable.

For example I configured mine with:

* L1: Paste
* R2: Right Click
* L2: Left click  &#10;  


* A: Enter
* Y: Space
* X: Backspace 
* Y: Suppr &#10;  

* L4: Show Keyboard
* R4:(empty)
* L5: Av Page (to scroll fast in pages)
* R5: Re Page &#10;  
 
* Directional pad = directional arrows (to slowly scroll a page a d left and right to position in a text)

Just with those simple changes the navigation in the Desktop mode is way more comfortable

jhppcd5,Thank you.,SteamDeck
jhot1qu,Read the reviews on steam. Doesn't seem good for anyone. I got MvC3 instead when it was on sale.,SteamDeck
jhotwq9,Most games on deep sale are *”worth it”*. You’ll easily get more time in hours out of it than you’re paying in dollars.,SteamDeck
jhoxz6f,"If you want to try something new and can get a hold of it I can recommend Street Fighter X Tekken.

It runs well on Steam Deck (after applying the community patch that removes Games for Windows Live) and is generally a lot of fun. At least a lot more fun than MvC Infinite.",SteamDeck
jhpxude,I grabbed it for 10 bucks with all the characters it was totally worth it can play a couple matches and put it down,SteamDeck
jhqfp0v,"I've been considering it as I see it is on sale indeed. As another commenter pointed out, nothing wrong with grabbing and playing a few matches to put it down. Besides, you can always come back to it later. I feel there's a lot of mixed or poorly-received games that might be given new life on the Deck since it's got that charm, so to speak. Also in theory, a lot of older games like Infinite shouldn't have much of an issue running on Deck. So ultimately, I'd say it's not the worst thing to do with money.",SteamDeck

Capcom has delisted it as they are to lazy to remove Games for Windows Live from the game and it won't launch without it anymore (hence the community patch removing it from the game, as the service has shut down years ago).

Keys are still being sold here and there, but it ain't cheap. It might be available through... less reputable sources, but I've owned it since release so I didn't have to look into that.",SteamDeck

jhp41lj,"If you don’t mind emulating, SLAI is an old gem from the PS2 era. 

Steel Lancer Arena International is a mech arena game. You enter a battle arena of a city (around the world) and fight other mechs, earning money for takedowns. Crash enough mechs and the boss “Ranker” for that rank and map will enter. Beat them and you’re the rank holder now.

It’s fun if you love to just cruise around an arena map killing enemies, and it has some pretty in depth systems for customization. 

I highly, highly recommend you use the Stock Market exploit if you play. The game can be a real terrible grind because of the low starting money. The game has 2 stocks, which raise or lower value on a set 100 day schedule. You buy A on one day, sell on another and buy B. Skip a few days, sell B, and it keeps going. You end up with like 10x the money. Makes the game a lot more enjoyable when you can actually afford to buy parts and tune them",SteamDeck

long story short

1. you probably wont get any kind of ""cease and desist"" (technically) if you're only downloading, you'd only get something like that for distributing content. You may, however get penalized by your ISP which could be anything from a slap on the wrist, to a permanent ban of service, up to legal issues if the copywrite holder wishes to press charges.
2. it depends on how you're downloading. if you're using peeer to peeer programs/protocols with out masking your network info then it is very likely you'll get a notice sooner or later. If you're downloading something just hosted at a website then it is highly unlikely you'd experience any issues from that as there is no way for the copywrite holder to know that you're downloading their stuff unless they setup or gained control of the website its self.",SteamDeck
jhm8dmg,"The worst you can get is a warning.

ISPs are mostly after ""big fish"" violators like the people who *host* websites that distribute ROMs and are in violation of *millions* of law breaks.

Almost constant 60fps, too.

jhpxz90,"If you arent worried about playing with best graphics (shaders are impacted by load speed) and are fIne with just buying a micro sd card and waiting a little longer for load times on some games then you wont need anything else. BUT... if you ever intend to care about those things and dont feel like opening up your steam deck or paying someone else to do it, then it might not be a bad idea to at least get the 256gb SSD version.",SteamDeck
jhpzmdz,"Only reason I would say go to the next tier is shader cache. Outside of that you will be fine. Getting a micro sd to boost the memory is always the move and the load times are barely noticeable, about .5 - 2 seconds longer if I remember correctly. Other than that the steam deck is probably the best purchase you will make regarding games.",SteamDeck
jhq1xwy,"I don't generally recommend the 64gb version because even if you use an SD card (which you should on any deck given how huge games are these days), some data - especially shader caches - will automatically go onto your internal drive anyway. And programs that aren't part of steam like those you get from discover go onto the internal drive too.

In theory the shader caches will be shrinking with the next big Deck update, but that's still just putting off the problem; 64gb really isn't much room at all. 

That said, the 64gb version + a bigger 2230 SSD is much, much cheaper than valve's asking price for the 256/512 versions, if you have the skills to replace the drive yourself. 

If you don't intend to pull the 64gb drive and replace with a bigger one (they go up to 2tb and this is still potentially cheaper than valve's asking price for the 512 Deck), I'd get the 256gb version. It's what I have and I'm very happy with it.",SteamDeck

Now to be fair I've also not used the deck a whole lot, it just made me go back and play games on my desktop (bigger screen), and last time I went on vacation I took it with me, but I was too tired to play games when I had the occasion.

I quickly realized how much I didnt like the steam deck when I found out the games I wanted to play (New games) can hardly run on the thing, was getting 20-30fps on hogwarts. This made me go to older games like Star Wars Jedi Surviors which ran and looked great but I didnt buy this thing to play a 4 year old game... After a week of noticing myslef not even touching the thing it was a quick and easy return. I think the price of 400 is great but that 400 was a huge waste of money for me.

Though a common theme throughout is that the Ikea Effect definitely plays into my enjoyment of the game:

- Tyrian 2000 was the first game where I really invested the energy into learning how to craft a really good SD keybind
- Getting StarCraft playable without piracy, without making a battle.net account and without using the horrible Blizzard launcher took a long time but was _oh so worth it_
- Minecraft Legends I literally had to build my own Proton to get it to run! Mind you, I didn't write the patch, but I did learn how to set up podman, checkout a git branch with submodules and use the `patch` tool!",SteamDeck

If I launch it in desktop mode, it immediately cuts to a black screen and hangs there. I use the term loosely as the emulator is still running frames. But it just remains black. 

So Primehack isn’t for the Wii U version? Interesting you say you have to drop it in the Primehack folder. I wasn’t expecting that. I would have just dropped it in the Wii folder! That’s a problem avoided, cheers. I have so many other questions!! lol

I’ve been playing Hyrule Warriors on Cemu too and it’s been awesome. To some degree I have Cemu figured out. I did find that the Wii U ‘shop’ games however, the one’s on Wii U helper, didn’t run in my Cemu configuration. Again, a different matter.",SteamDeck
jhoi33q,"You could certainly drop it into the Wii folder, but you won't get all the upgrades and twin stick controls that Primehack provides, so definitely depends on what experience you want to have.

jhojqy8,"Naturally the best experience. Whatever that may be for the most hardcore of fans. So I duplicate the copy, find the Primehack folder and drop it there too? 

Erm. Cemu wise, to be honest I haven’t tried. Getting Cemu working on my Steam Deck was my focus of late. It’s definitely a troubleshooting option to consider! Thank you. 

If the Cemu version isn’t worth the effort, then I’ll wait out the Wii download, texture and Primehack it. If the Wii U version should run but isn’t due to either a dodgy ROM or it just isn’t compatible, then I’d rather tweak that - if the controls are ‘modern’ as such and comparable to the HD modded Wii version requiring Primehack. Does that make sense? Graphically are they the same do you know? 

Yeah, I’d prefer the most ‘eye melting’ graphics on Deck for the game I can achieve so that’s definitely important and I know the controls might need extra work to work but the controls aren’t my concern at this point unless they need to be.

jhput8u,"I wouldn't do this as a ""standard out of the box"" change.

**RDR2** and **Sons of the Forest** are the only two ""confirmed"" games that this ""fixes"".

It could have some impact on other large, open world games - but the evidence is circumstantial until I see some proof :D",SteamDeck
jhqj42j,What dis do?,SteamDeck
jhq44ik,"This is often combined with the swap fixes, because you're reducing the overall system RAM available to the CPU at all times, and it's actually those that are generally responsible for the performance improvements/crash prevention. Have you applied the swap fixes, and if so, was your testing done with or without those applied?

This should only have an impact in Windows, since (at least at one time), it was unable to dynamically allocate VRAM. That's not the situation with SteamOS, and whether you set the UMA frame buffer to 1GB or 4GB, it can dynamically allocate up to 8GB of VRAM. As such, this would only benefit a pretty edge case scenario where the CPU was starving the GPU of VRAM, yet somehow, reducing the RAM available to the CPU doesn't also impact performance.",SteamDeck
jhpuqpf,Very good to know,SteamDeck
jhpvi6e,it helps no game (though people are very susceptible to placebos on here) and hurts RDR2 for the exact reason that people also claims it helps. people like to claim that setting the vram to 4GB prevents the CPU from using it (which it does) which they claim helps performance because they use this weird logic of it being better to starve the cpu than the gpu. RDR2 is an example of that flawed logic. starving either the cpu or gpu will hurt performance. RDR2 wants to use around 12GB of ram for the cpu but when you set the 4GB in bios it limits it to about 11GB hence the peformance issue. on top of that it doesn't matter what vram you set in the bios it will use up to 8GB of vram regardless the bios setting does nothing more than lock the cpu from using the 4GB and it will not make a game use more vram. both 256MB and 4GB will use the same exact amount of vram,SteamDeck
jhpupaw,"Idk, it really did help with Bully. Genuinely fixed all the stuttering and dips",SteamDeck
jhpvxl1,"It can help by robbing standard RAM if a game is keeping more than it needs, but that's not really a big selection.",SteamDeck
jhpxskg,"I think the issue in SteamOS is it's eager to allocate to memory rather than VRAM in situations where VRAM would be preferred leading to situations where it starves the GPU of vram that would boost performance than keeping memory allocated.

jhqgbwv,"So, choke the CPU and it stutters… or choke the GPU and it stutters. So, at the very least, changing this setting yields 0 results with the exception of RDR2. However, there are many people who cite positive results after dedicating additional resources to the GPU. If there was no possibility that changing this setting would yield performance benefits, why would Valve allow this setting to be modified in the BIOS? Any excuse you can come up with is pure speculation and likely wrong… because there are many other settings Valve has specifically locked from modification within the BIOS.

jhpw6ay,do explain to me how 4GB of vram changed dynamically is any different than 4GB of ram reserved. neither is preallocated. literally the only difference is that the 4GB is locked in the ram pool unable to be used by the cpu at all otherwise they are both only used as needed up to 8GB,SteamDeck
jhqlcxq,as I've said to people like you multiple times now which none of you can answer tell me the difference between 4GB being dynamically set vs 4GB being set in bios? it doesn't make the game use more vram and both 256MB and 4GB will use the same exact amount  of vram in every single game. so people like you can get bitchy all you want but you are the ones falling for a placebo with zero ability to explain otherwise. people also seem to have this odd mindset where the cpu will claim all the ram with the gpu having zero ability to claim any for itself unless its set in the bios. that would be such poor ass optimization if this illogical claim was actually true. just because cpu is given priority doesn't mean it won't be optimized when necessary.,SteamDeck
jhr4ulz,like asking why isn't there an auto setting which would easily take care of all of these kind of posts in the first place. every other device has an auto option but since it doesn't people are convinced the gpu can't claim ram back from the cpu and that the cpu will instead just hog it all,SteamDeck

jhpxa8q,"did I call you a liar? no.  but many people have a clear lack of understanding how that setting even works. hell its very easily possible that a fresh restart which cleans the ram is what ""fixed"" the issue but you fooled yourself into thinking its the vram setting. literally go test 256MB and 4GB you will see the game uses the same amount of vram",SteamDeck
jhpy68t,this is just plain wrong. I've tested both 256MB and 4GB extensively not only does every single game use the same amount of vram regardless of the bios setting but they had the same exact performance outside of 4GB causing performance issues by starving the cpu,SteamDeck

jhr9eh5,the default 1GB isn't bad and won't hurt anything but you still lose an extra 744MB that will only be locked to the gpu though realistically most games will use over 1GB dynamically anyway . you will just have more usable ram in general by setting it to 256MB. neither will have worse or better performance gaming wise though.,SteamDeck

You already should be able to do it in desktop mode with DisplayCAL (definitely calibration works although I haven't tested profiling).

Once I switched it to 12 bit color after getting a HDMI to displayport cable, my god what a difference it made.

Perhaps the deck is only outputting 8 bit color and that's why it looks fucked?

HDMI 2.0 bandwidth can only support 8 bit color at 60 FPS, HDMI 2.1 can only support 10 bit at 60 FPS. A displayport to HDMI cable can display 12 bit color at 60 FPS. Meaning an official dock from Valve +an HDMI to displayport cable should have the best results for color output. The valve dock has a displayport port, jsaux's dock only has HDMI.

I have the JSAUX dock because I bought my deck before the official dock released, so unfortunately I can't test it for you.

The color bit depth makes such a crazy difference in output, video, videogame and color quality. It almost looks like a higher resolution.

If we get the specs for the battery life in Wh.
And power consumption from the device at idling and normal usage for a game at the screen resolution. Im more then happy.

Maximal power consumption is relevant but not as important as the ones above.
Almost every poweruser phone will die when pushing it to the limits. 4-5h is the average, ask me how i know. And using it like this will kill the battery in 2-3years.

It will be important later. If we have to push he handhelds to max in toster game.",SteamDeck
jhq6vjl,"Battery life is super-important in any hand-held, for the vast bulk of users.

It was telling that Asus didn't even mention battery-life at first.

As far as metrics go, we need something that measures like for like.

You say asking ""battery life at Doom Eternal at X settings and Y framerate"" is useful. Maybe.

But even then, you'd still be comparing apples and orange-coloured things.  The ""happy zones"" for different devices are very different.

If the Ally turns out to be a very pretty, very expensive battery-murderer then it will probably still have a market. There will be some gamers who will just live with the battery life restrictions, indeed may not care about them. They're just there for the performance, and will resort to battery packs and plugging the thing in all the time.

But, IMO, many more gamers won't. Not for the (very high) price.

The Steam Deck is still niche. (It's not even available in most of the world.) And I see the Ally as an even smaller niche. The pricing + battery life may keep it niche.

Also: Valve is obviously invested in the Deck as a concept. Not just the handheld market, but a Steam Handheld. Whereas Asus is just interested in selling a PC handheld. You have to expect Asus to move on to the next iteration or product lineup very soon. That's the whole business model. That might mean there's less incentive for Asus to really develop their client software.

(OTOH, they don't have to develop their client software anywhere near to Valve's degree, because they're just running on Windows. And MS is providing the heavy lifting.)",SteamDeck

I understand.... maybe 25% of your post. And I'm a computer guy but I'm not into the deep elements of watts, different chips and running them effectively. So none of what your said really made sense other then ""If you can get it to run more effectively, you can get the same battery life with better quality"". Which sounds great but it makes the conversation longer.  


What I can about as the average joe who doesn't understand all of that talk, is can it play the game in a manner I'll enjoy for how long? Lot of people care about frame rates, so long as it's 30 I don't care much beyond that because I can't tell the difference.   


You may have a point that we should be talking about efficient use of the battery. But I don't think many people know/care to know enough about that to have that conversation. So people thus turn to the conversation of minimum battery life, because they can understand that one.",SteamDeck
jhr6jua,Precisely.,SteamDeck
jhq9nvk,"And I never said it's not important. Of course battery life matters. Average battery life. In typical usecases.

Minimum battery life is what I have issue with. Remember the PR shit storm that was ""2 to 8 hours of battery"" and later ""as little as 87 minutes of battery""? ASUS is obviously trying to avoid that because at 35 watt max TDP the minimum battery life of that device will be under an hour. And that measurement is effectively meaningless for average usecases.",SteamDeck

jhsd0yc,"40wh battery. Max wattage is about 40watts. It'll more than likely run as low as 6watts or so, just like the Deck.",SteamDeck
jhsdhuk,"Edit: ""why argue when you can just question the other person's mental health"", nice

It's not about importance. It's about usefulneas. 

Yes, I have a Deck. And of course getting 1.5 hours when pushing the device to its max isn't great. But that's exactly the thing. It'll never ever be great for PC handhelds because ""pushing the device to its max"" isn't a fix quantity and batteries improve in energy density very slowly. So you'll always be in a one to 1.5 hour range.

Valve could have done something similar to the switch and locked max TDP to 8 watts. Then you'd have a minimum battery life about 3.5 hours. Does that make for a better device in your eye?",SteamDeck
jhtk6oo,"I'm not really even talking about efficient use. More like average use, or more realistic use. The comparison to phone battery life is very apt. It makes no sense for me to quote the 2 hour battery life that I *can* reduce my Samsung phone to under extreme circumstances, as in normal use case the battery life I get will be different. Similarly it makes little sense for me to focus on the max battery life I can get out of the device (probably 3 or 4 days) because again in a normal use case the battery life I get will be different.

These numbers still matter, but they shouldn't be the highlight. Battery life is a spectrum. Minimum and maximum are only two points on that spectrum and minimum is particularly deceiving because, as I mention, more efficient cooling will *reduce* your minimum battery life in a PC handheld (because performance isn't artificially limited).",SteamDeck
jhrhfkr,"I'm also limiting myself to lower demanding games for the Deck. If i want to play RDR2 I do it on my 3070 laptop. But I try to play as many games as I can for the Deck, because of the real enemy and money sucker, which is the power bill.

jhqb7rn,"You're ignoring that the Ally has the 1080p screen which they've been boasting so much about.  The pointless screen means the device will have to work harder than the Deck to achieve similar metrics.  Also their claim is that they have a similar battery life at 15 watts but again, they keep boasting about how much more power this thing can use.

If they want to keep acting like they got such a good thing going, then surely there's no problem analyzing it to see how ""Good"" it actually is, right?  Honestly, I'm kinda excited for this thing to come out so we can see how much of a lemon it actually is.",SteamDeck

You’re not going to listen to explanations of why and accept this. I’m not sure what you’re trying to accomplish.",SteamDeck
jhu3z0g,"But I guess my point is kinda that this is a discussion now. It is a spectrum, but I'm looking for a baseline ""quick"" answer, not a discussion about what I can do to get better or worse battery life. So knowing the Minimum I can get is a great answer to wanting a baseline.",SteamDeck
jhqvh35,"A cursory look at this sub will tell you that this isn't true in a handheld context. Most people playing on PC handhelds strive for a balance between performance and power, and in some cases push for max power (often a ""I'm near a power source anyway"") and in some other cases push for max battery (i.e. ""I'm in a car ride and don't have a battery"").

Discussions of battery life need to consider all three (so no, I'm not saying that a consumer wouldn't want to or shouldn't know the battery life under max load). My point though, is that the minimum battery end of the spectrum is not very useful, as it's driven entirely by cooling performance. Your cooling system maxes out at 30 watts? Then that's your max power draw and you get 80 minutes of minimum battery life. What's that? You *doubled* the efficiency of your cooling solution? Well great. Now your minimum battery life is 40 minutes.

Phone reviews have this nailed down quite well. You won't ever see a headline that says ""Galaxy S20+, great phone, but only has a 2 hour battery life"". The reality is that 2 hours *is* the minimum battery life of that phone. The average battery life in a standard use case though is closer to 14 hours. Reviewers will test this by running the phone through different tests that try to mimic and average usecase. We need to have a similar kind of discussion for PC handhelds.",SteamDeck
jhqbyf5,"Just to be clear: I'm not defending the Ally. I have no intention of buying it. This discussion is for all PC handhelds, as they are unique in this department compared to something like a Switch.

Also there is every reason to believe that at 15 watts TDP the Ally will have roughly the same battery life as the Deck, give or take 5 or 10 minutes. 35 watt TDP is a whole other story.

And yeah, they have an advantage with economies of scale, but that only goes so far. Ram is a commodity and only goes so cheap. Samsung (or whomever) still needs to make a profit on selling them the display. 

At $699 they're starting to push up against parts costs limitations. Im sure they could probably sell it for $699. But how much profit is going to be left in it. Valves top model (to which they describe the price as being painful) is $649 and they can subsidize the thing. ASUS _can not_ subsidize the price with after sale purchases. 

Again, being the largest means _something,_ but it foesnt mean everything, becuse the most expensive parts are not made in house. 

And here's the thing, building a circuit board, once it's already been designed, isn't terribly hard. You hit the lowest scaled price pretty quick. I was sorta involved with a high end audio project. When they ordered their main boards, they didn't get a discount on them past 10,000 boards. It didn't matter if they order 10,000,000, because by 10,000 the price was already so low that of they went any lower, the board would be being sold at a unsustainable price. 

Building molds is similar. Molds are tens of thousands of dollars. And have a finite lifespan. Yeah, they have the expertise, but it's still expensive for them to do in house. And I doubt they do it in house. I would bet anything that all their plastics are done by a 3rd party. Which costs money. Just as much as it costs Aya. They're not saving here. 

We know what a lot of the costs are. We know a lot of them are fixed (doesn't matter how many they make). And we know that at $699, they're isnt  much wiggle room for profit. And we also know that they need a largish profit because they aren't going to be selling games.",SteamDeck

It doesn't really matter anyways. The parts cost for the ally is going to be higher than the SD no matter what. Then screen will be more expensive and the apu will be more expensive. Valve almost definitely hit the bottom prices of bulk. And this is an important point. Asus isn't saving _any more than valve does_ on the most expensive parts in the dingus. 

Valve is almost definitely making the devices damn near as cheap as Asus could. There is probably a bit more on economies of scale, bit not much, and certainly not enough to make it profitable.

jhs0ofb,">Though they did say it wasn't a loss leader, but again, they said it for the whole line, not just one.

I looked back at the announcements, I couldn't find any reference to how the margins worked per SKU. 

We'll know in 15 days the pricing on the Ally one way or the other. From video reviews I've seen of the Ally, Asus has been working on this for 5 years. Whatever people want to say about Asus, they make a lot of hardware and have been doing gaming focused PC hardware for a long time. 

They clearly know about the Deck and the historical pricing issues that have hampered PC handhelds. This is by far the biggest push for a PC handheld from a major PC maker ever, with AMD announcing an APU specifically for this form factor and even Microsoft throwing in a 3 month Game Pass sub.

I don't see how with all of that Asus wouldn't have obviously seen the importance of getting at least one Ally SKU close pricewise to the top line Deck. Maybe that didn't and the thing starts at $999 for the base model. But how would anyone at Asus or AMD think that's not going to be a huge problem. Even before the Deck that kind of pricing was problem.

The pricing of the Deck was the key to the success it has had. That's going to be no different from the Ally. Price it well, the base model between $650 to $700, the Extreme could sell for $900 plus and I doubt Asus will be able to make enough of them for a while.",SteamDeck

Maybe Valve saw what bigger, more protective boxes and packaging were going to cost to ship and realized it wouldn't be that much more expensive to just include a case with smaller boxes to ship. 

In any case I actually kinda disagree about how protective the stock case is.

It's such a common saying, but I've never seen solid reasoning, *especially* when not considering R&D cost, which I wouldn't in this wording (""Valve is losing money on their Steam Deck Project"" would be a better wording in this case, because they are not losing more money by selling more devices).  

Videos basing cost of parts on the [iFixit parts cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSL89u19w4) seem insanely stupid, especially when comparing to actual [BoM analysis](https://report.counterpointresearch.com/posts/report/component_tracker/category:Teardown%20and%20BOM), which I haven't found for the Steam Deck though, so maybe I'll learn something.",SteamDeck

jhk3uk4,"sure it's a good deal, and I'd not say that Valve makes a killing on them.  

If I had to guess, low end covers their cost per device/tiny margin. Enough High End Sales will cover their dev costs.  
The Price point is ""painful"" because isolated making and selling it makes no sense, takes too long to make an overall profit with a decent risk (well, probably not too risky anymore, but they couldn't know that), but it overall makes sense for valve to open up a new market, increase games sales to more ""console-gamers"" and weaken their reliance on windows.  
Also Painful, because they had to forgo nice features like an OLED screen, more USB C Ports etc.  

Laptop Makers have more SKUs to manage, more marketing costs, have to make their R&D money back with the device and need to cover shitty products which don't sell and then still want some profit on top.

The problems with Cyberpunk were quite different though really. It was mainly bugs and missing features that were the problem. Performance has been improved, but only so much. The game is still trash to play on PS4/Xbox1 for example.

With TLOU they're going to fundamentally revamp the way the port operates. Currently the game is trying to pre-load 20-30GB of textures into VRAM/RAM, likely to compensate for the loss of the PS5's very fast NVMe.

I would be hesitant to agree with the fact that games are targeted for 25 FPS for years on purpose. Sure when our gaming hardware was pretty bad compared to todays standards, and the tech simply wasn't there to make things run well.

Save folder locations are listed here: [https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hollow\_Knight#Save\_game\_data\_location](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hollow_Knight#Save_game_data_location)

If you're playing it through proton, it'll be in the game's pfx folder found in home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/367520. The folders from there on will follow Windows' file structure so use PCGW's reference to the Windows version's save folder.

Make a backup of the files in there just in case (!). Then, delete the corrupted save file (the one ending in .dat), and remove the .bak file name extension from the most recent backup files that end in .bak so that it matches the file name of the now deleted corrupted save (e.g. user1.dat). Try launching again. If it still doesn't work, go back to an older backup and try again.

It may set you back to the last time you saved the game, but at least you can continue playing.

Steam may prompt you that your local save is older and ask which version of the save you'd like to use, the local one or the Cloud version, in which case you should pick the newly recovered local one.

Frustratingly, it may also auto-replace your recovered save with the one in Cloud. The easiest way to avoid this from happening is to do all the file changes while the game is running and when you're done close the game, so that Steam Cloud synchronizes the fixed file. This is most easily done by making HK run windowed and then leaving it in the background while you're recovering your files.

I'm just curious as to why My *I wouldn't call it a big guy, more like, halfway to manhood idk lol* 512gb SD card was WAAAAAAY better in performance than the lil guy it came with. 

Then I was informed that the lil guy was basically a glorified cheap SD card on an m.2 pcb that stored the shader cache, and the SD card was much faster with higher read and write speeds.",SteamDeck

My new SSD had way more on it, the emmc lil guy reminded me of when I bought my first SD card that had a chip bulging out of the bottom of it, it still fit in my phone but it still required me to apply force because it wouldn't slide into the card slot all the way. Nostalgia Yo!",SteamDeck

If a game loading is waiting on loading shaders stored on the internal drive, then yes, that can slow down overall loading.

Probably won't make a huge difference though if your games are stored on the SD card.",SteamDeck

Shaders on slow internal storage, game on SD card. 
Game works fine, but hangup is dependent on the internal storage shader cache, Longer loading times... So it does have an effect. Although it's preventable, but still, there is an effect.

jhgzo28,Gotcha thanks I will look into that I just gotta look up how to do that. I was just wondering if I can use the left pad as an d pad,SteamDeck
jhltozh,"I love the fact that we have access to both of them and tbh I wouldn't change a thing on the deck. I find the trackpads incredibly useful! It was a feature I was really looking forward to using for shooter games especially but I just can't get on with them for that genre of gaming, not sure why lol Rts games they're great! Navigating the OS and browsers are fantastic but I've tried a bunch of times to use them in shooters and have failed haha I want to use them while gaming so badly because I'm terrible at aiming on sticks 😂

To answer your question though: They're already in the best place they can be really. The only other way around (Imo) would be to flip the trackpads and joystick positions so the trackpads are on top and joysticks on the bottom. But like I said, they're already in the best place really, it's just a personal issue I think.

I have been thinking about switching the control scheme around for a while now with shooters. E.g R5=R2, L5=L2, R4=R1, L4=L1 and giving it a try that way with the trackpads so that my right index finger is on R4 and right middle finger is on R5 with the left hand following the same grip.",SteamDeck
jhh0zgk,"By default it should act as a D-pad. I always felt it was a little too easy to press the wrong direction on it, but that doesn't mean you'll have the same experience.

To enable the back buttons, hit the steam button while you're in the game. Push right on the D-pad once the menu is up and you should see a ""configure controls"" or something similar button. From there you can enable and map them.",SteamDeck
jhid6gb,"Just wait until you dive into the options available in the controller customization settings. It's amazing, and one of the best features of the device that nobody really talks about.

Steam input is a godsend, truly.",SteamDeck
jhj3sg8,"For real. Steam Deck is not only my favorite gaming device, but also my favorite controller now. Whenever I'm playing on the TV with a DS5 controller I play worse because of the missing buttons. Obviously you can customize DS5 via Steam input as well, but there's just less to work with.

Usually on portable platforms there is a level of sacrifice with controller ergonomics, but with the Deck it feels like the reverse when switching to a traditional controller.

I've logged over 90 hours on Fallout 4 in the past couple weeks. The game is marked as best played with mouse and keyboard but the Deck handles it with no problem.",SteamDeck
jhl2u4n,"It's the only controller I've ever used that is tolerable with games that rely heavily on mouse.

You can get the [Micron 2TB Drive](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR99P.shtml&order_id=323669245&sitem=B09WR99#Availability)  straight from a US distributor for $158. The same price as the [1TB Inland TN446](https://www.microcenter.com/product/663766/inland-tn446-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck). 
The closest *available* option to this is the 2TB SN740 from AliExpress for $160+ but it's a risk and you won't have a warranty if you're within the US. The Micron 2TB has also been listed on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/micron-2tb-2400-series/p/0D9-0022-000N1?Item=0D9-0022-000N1) for $160 but is out of stock and they have cancelled many orders from those that were able to place them when it came in stock earlier this week...

Alternatively, if that's out of your price range you can buy the [1TB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01112_B09WR98P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!#Availability) for $89.  Comparatively, the [1TB Sabrent Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) sells for $160 on Amazon. And if you're fortunate enough to live near a Microcenter, they also sell their [1TB Inland TN346](https://www.microcenter.com/product/649991/inland-tn436-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-2230-internal-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck) for around $130, now on sale for $109 to match the brand new [1TB Corsair MP600](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Storage/M-2-SSDs/MP600-MINI-PCIe-4-0-%28Gen-4%29-x4-NVMe-M-2-2230-SSD/p/CSSD-F1000GBMP600MN) that is also selling for $109.


A lot of people find the convenience of going to Microcenter to purchase and exchange/swap the SSD *if* it ever fails much more valuable than the extra storage space and that's fine, but I would personally rather have double the storage and a new backplate for the same price or less than either of the 1TB Inland Drives.

If that's STILL not in the budget, you can get the [512GB Version](https://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=thispage&thispage=01300000U01108_B09WR97P.shtml&order_id=195411450) for $53. You may be able to find a cheaper 512gb version but I haven't looked into that aspect of the market.

There's a backorder on ShopBLT because everyone here ordered them, but the Micron, Sabrent Rocket, WD SN740, Corsair MP600 and both Inland TN446 and TN436 will perform nearly the same in the SteamDeck due to the PCI-e gen inside the deck. The Micron also comes with a full US warranty as well.

For context the Micron drives are the same drives that [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd?variant=40034191966311) is selling for $300.

>And is  any Dock good enough or should I order the official one?

I like that valve support the official one very well for the best compatibility. in addition you get a second power brig with it that makes the price much more reasonably. I have one from jsaux (the second one that came with gbit) and they just released one update for better compatibility with some monitors but breaks with others :/ and the gbit lan is just wired over USB2 that limit the speed to 480mbit

jhmx7w2,"My deck is actually a Linux PC that sometimes doubles as a handheld.


I have an off brand dock that i bought many months ago and I have to say it's not very good, it does the basics but that's it, if i plug in an external drive the other USBs stop working, like mouse and keyboard, so get a good one.


My uses are normal video/internet browsing, working with dozens of tabs, text files and VSCode open, i do some python occasionally, but even a raspberry pi can endure this level of usage, there's no way the steam deck wouldn't be able to do.


I'd say internal storage is a limitation if you want to work, download stuff and have games there, but you can have a good SD card, or just leave everything that's not game related in a external drive that you can leave permanently plugged in on the dock.",SteamDeck

But unless you already have a full dock setup, including a FHD monitor, you're going to find that while these things are possible, they're also painful due to the lack of a non-onscreen keyboard combined with what would be pretty much my last choice of a desktop environment for a handheld (MATE would have been the obvious choice--I **do not understand** why they went with KDE Plasma).

FWIW, Windows is no better unless you have software you have to use that doesn't work natively in Linux or through WINE (basically I mean: The Adobe Suite).

Anyway, if you're looking at the Deck as a gaming console first that can do PC stuff in a pinch, the Steam Deck will absolutely leave you satisfied.

That was for installing a ton of mods for Knights of the Old Republic 2. I ended up creating an ext4 filesystem in a sparse file for the game. Worked well enough for me.

I have since found out that there even is a FUSE filesystem you can use to get casefolding on any underlying filesystem. Can't remember the name but I think it was also mentioned on the SteamOS issue tracker for BTRFS support or something.",SteamDeck

Having a flag that i can switch the folders where I need is enough for me. (That said, I've seen that some partition already use BTRFS on SteamOS).

Anyway, thanks for the input. I didn't think about a sparse file solution.

EDIT: BTW the compression performance for me It's pretty bad. I'm on Arch on my main PC and I have a 2018 Intel Xeon processor. I noticed that when I navigate the folders it is very sluggish. Updates or Defrag didn't solve anything. I have a SATA3 SSD.",SteamDeck

I tested with CU off and on and performance is still about 4-8% higher with CU, but worse than when I originally tested it in my Deck Dive. 

I’m hopeful that SteamOS 3.5’s L3 cache improvements and some proton updates will help, but for now I think we’ll just need to lower settings a bit (at least until I get another chance to look at it thoroughly).

jhmi2yk,"You need 240Hz. Minimum. Thats a joke.

FSR is resolution agnostic. It works with every resolution target you throw at it.

Which FSR do you mean? Steamdecks internal FSR. Or the games internal FSR?

Because Steam Decks internal FSR afair scales everything to the output resolution the Steam Deck itself is set to in display options. With the source resolution as a base. (Looks worse if target display resolution is higher. But only as a rough rule of thumb, actually display diameter plays more into it than output resolution, if FSR upscales from the same base resolution.) Steam Decks internal FSR (FSR version 1 based) is available for every game.

A games internal (as in built in) FSR scales everything to the resolution the game is set to in game. With the FSR quality level picked dictating the source resolution. (Runs slower (less frames) if taget output resolution/FSR quality level is higher) Built in FSR in a game is not available in every game.

Output resolution on the Steam Deck is also limited by ""a container per game"" which can be set in the games shortcut settings in game mode, and thats the ""max"" resolution the game is told the monitor can handle - which on default (setting afair is even called default) is always either 720p or 800p (thats auto switched between those two depending on aspect ratio), which is not at all the max of what your monitor can handle - but what Valve decided is best for the end user, to not run into ME GAME RUNS LIKE CRAP ON ME 8K MONITOR (or 1080p for that matter) postings.

And as a result you have all kinds of postings out there of people saying, that their games look like crap on big monitor, because steam deck games  always output at 720p! Which is wrong (they dont if you change that container setting, and then the in games resolution option) - but why should we correct them really... What we did trying to support a learning community gets swiped away by 60 support me longtime postings each day.

For your purposes: 1080p monitor better.",SteamDeck
jhmigbh,"Any time the render resolution is less than the output resolution (i.e. the native resolution of the display), FSR can be used. 1080p or 1440p output doesn't matter. All that matters is what the game is rendering is less than that.

That said, the larger the gulf between the render resolution and output resolution the worse the upscaling will be. For example, rendering at 800p and outputting at 1080p will give better results than outputting at 1440p, as there's less pixels to invent. However, rending at native or as high as possible is always going to be best. The goal of upscaling is to get close to native quality while saving the performance cost of actually rendering at native. Therefore, it's a balancing act.",SteamDeck

jhmlsh8,"Signal path is this: FSR 1.0 based upscaling is very light on resources, as in ""costing  a frame or so"" compared to bilinear upscaling. Target resolution almost doesnt matter, as long as the source resolution stays the same. CPU cost will always be ""arround one frame"" (let it be 2 if it scales to 1440p and that would be an unexpected 100% performance cost increase) when compared to bilinear upscaling. Also just as a rough outline, because frames in different games are not equally costly to render, obviously.

So here is the sequence of things. Lets say a game supports FSR2:

FSR 2 set in game options > looks at quality level also set in game options sets input (games render resolution) resolution based on that and the games target output resolution > games target output resolution will almost always be set to 720p or 800p.

In that instance with FSR 2.0 set to balanced it will set render resolution to 72% (from memory) of the games target resolution. To a higher percentage resolution if you set it to quality. FSR 2.0 very costly compared to FSR 1.0. But also mostly dependent on the games target resolution, as it will set render resolution based on a percentage of that.

Games target resolution is set to 720p/800p because of the games container settings, that can be changed in the games shortcut options in gaming mode, and  presuming, that the game autopicks the highest available resolution. Which it is told is 720p/800p. You can change that in the games shortcut settings. (Away from default.) And then would also have to change it in game settings. (Container settings are just the maximum the game is told (lied to) the display is capable of.)

Valve tries to not show that to the user too much, because once you start to set games output resolutions to a TVs resolution by auto, auto picking everything, like every honcho would like to do it - the steam decks GPU cant handle that on most games. Its designed for 800p@40Hz output on most modern games. So if you connect it to a 1080p@60Hz TV and let it dictate what the game renders, screaming by people increases. But you can bring your steamdeck to actually render a game in 1080p@60hz or even 8k@60Hz natively - if the game is very ""light"" - or if you enjoy playing on 1 frame per second.

So lets say you stuck to 800p.

FSR 2.0 built into game and enabled, balanced preset picked, game autopicked 800p because it was told by the ""container"" thats the highest resolution the monitor supports (it isnt - but the container tells it any value you like, and by default it tells it either 720p or 800p based on detected aspect ratio).

Game looks at 800p output resolution and at FSR 2.0 balanced settings, takes 72% of that, sets games render resolution to 576p and outputs 800p FSR 2.0 scaled.

At that point the decks built in FSR can kick in - always looks at the games output resolution which in this case would be 800p and FSR 1.0 scales it to whatever target display resolution is set or autopicked in the steamdecks display settings, when an external display is connected.

Steamdecks FSR 1.0 could also kick in if you set the games base resolution to 576 or 640 or anything in the games resolution settings and didnt enable the games built in FSR at all. It doesnt care, it doesnt even care if the game supports FSR. It takes the games output resolution (576, 640, or 800 or anything really) and scales it to whatever resolution is set (or auto set) in the steamdecks display settings for the connected display. And all that it takes for doing that is 1 frame of games performance, maybe. (Just as a rough outline.)

Hz are interesting as well.

So for many games Steamdeck operates best at 40Hz, but not many displays support that as an input. Some do.

So when you connect an external display Steamdeck creates a second config (as in connected to a TV or monitor config) per game that always defaults to 60Hz again, like your steamdeck does out of the box. You can then force it to 40Hz f.e. (by enabling a special setting acknowledging that you know what you are doing) in the battery menu again - but if your external screen stays dark after that you know it doesnt support 40Hz. :)

Using 40Hz instead of 60Hz if the game is only able to provide a locked 40fps f.e. using the graphics settings you chose, might improve frame pacing. Meaning not every 3rd frame or so gets doubled (cost free, but judders). Thats why you'd potentially pick it over 60Hz at all.",SteamDeck

But just putting out ""wishes to the universe"" (which was a popular self help book series, I'm told) might not scale if you look at an environment where the last three pages of a subreddit were people trying to solicit expert professional help individually.

Testing different proton layers or looking into what a game might require to run, based on what you know it uses as a graphics backend, its not just a quick, hey hit me up with the information issue. Its you trying to get someone to work on it for multiple hours.

So if you show understanding, and indicate that this really is just a last ditch effort after you've tried many things yourself - its totally fine, but then we still need to differenciate, if you even used protondb before to find information on it.

So it does help, if you state that on your end.",SteamDeck
jhmgvwh,"Why doesnt service work, with something thats not expected by the service, is always a very fun piece of interaction to take part in.

Well, just hack into epics servers and steal their source code to find out. Actually, dont do that.

Because something broke.

Because you are doing it wrong.

Because the service provider decided against it.

Because a server is down.

Because Heroic updated.

Because your game broke.

Because you broke it in an unexpected fashion, by picking a path.

Pick one.
Pick two.
No, treats on the house, pick three.

The list is endless, really. Best place to find out? Heroics github.

But you could fish for ""it works for me on some game"" answer here as well I guess.

Is it the service, or you not understanding the UI? Or something entirely differently?

For all of these, you need to go to Desktop Mode: Steam button->Power->Desktop Mode

**Install Proton-GE**

This one is going to be pretty straightforward. In Desktop Mode, open the Discover Store. By default, it's on the dock at the bottom and the icon looks like a shopping bag. 

In there, search for Protonup-Qt. Then hit the Install button in the top-right. It'll do its thing and install that.

Then click the Steam Logo to bring up the menu. Look under the Games folder and you'll find Protonup-Qt. Run that.

It should bring up a window. Click on Add version then give it a minute to check the internet for available versions. Once you see it load, it should say ""GE-Proton"" at the top. If it doesn't, click the dropdown menu and select ""GE-Proton"". 

The bottom part, Version, should have the latest version of GE-Proton loaded. If not, use the dropdown to select it. Mine has GE-Proton7-55 so I'll use that as the example from here on.

Once done, click Install and let it do it's thing. Once it's done, you should see GE-Proton7-55 is installed. You can close the window now.

**Install protontricks**

Go to the Discover Store again and search for protontricks. Once you find it, install it just like you did with Protonup-Qt.

Once protontricks is installed, we need to open a console window. Open the menu again by clicking on the Steam logo in the bottom-left. Look under the System folder for Konsole. Open that.

In Konsole, you need to bring up the Steam keyboard by holding the Steam button and pushing `X`. Type in the following:

`protontricks 1293820 xact`

You can now close Konsole.

**Change the settings on the game**

Open Steam by clicking on the icon in the lower-right of the screen and going to Library. Once in your Steam Library, go to the game, click on the cogwheel icon, and go to Properties.

In the Shortcut tab, you're going to type the following into Launch Options:

`PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 %command%`

Then, click on the Compatibility tab. Check the box that says ""Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool"". It will give you a dropdown field. Click the dropdown and select the version we installed with Protonup-Qt earlier. In my case, I chose GE-Proton7-55.

You can now close the Properties window.

**Go back to game mode**

Close any windows you still have open. On your Desktop should be a link that says ""Return to Gaming Mode"". Double-click that and give it a minute. It should boot back into Game Mode.

Once in Game Mode, try to launch the game.

jhjz26l,"I have a main PC with some big drives and have been taking advantage of the ""[Steam Local Network Game Transfers](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/46BD-6BA8-B012-CE43)"" and it's been really helpful! Essentially you do have to download it again BUT it detects that a local computer on the network already has the game and instead downloads it from that computer locally via wi-fi.  After upgrading the drive to the NVMe M.2 it hadn't occurred to me to use an external. I'm curious if you feel there is any kind of noticeable difference when playing games on the base drive vs the MicroSD.",SteamDeck

jhjhx4f,Also curious,SteamDeck
jhfp1ay,"The tip says that the game installed in some media that is not connected, for example another SD card. So instead of downloading again, he could look for that card and plug it again.",SteamDeck
jhfp3sr,"It means that the game files were downloaded on this deck before, only to a different MicroSD card (one would assume). OP just needs to install that drive and theyre on their way to play it without needing to redownload all that data over again

Im playing through Dying Light right now and enjoying it but wonder if Days Gone would be a good follower to it",SteamDeck

jhhwyzk,">But how the deck will know when the card is lost, or stop working, or died because we forgot to remove it when we change the ssd ?

That's why it's only a note, and not a straight up restriction if you can download the game or not",SteamDeck

My sincere condolences.",SteamDeck
jhik6yw,"Unlimited has only recently become available. It’s still common practice (and courtesy) when going to someone’s house and asking “how much bandwidth do you have left?” before downloading anything. There are people still on 100 GB/month plans at 10 Mbps which is $50/month usually so I understand why people wouldn’t want to up that to say, 500 Mbps with unlimited bandwidth for more than double that.

I remember I used to have a 100 Mbps plan with 120 GB of bandwidth for $90/month (this was 8 years ago now) and we used to go over that with our Netflix subscription often to the point where everyone I knew monitored their usage and most didn’t get Netflix because of the bandwidth usage.",SteamDeck

jhgojg8,"It doesn't, it's just a note and not an error. Just a helpful little friend.",SteamDeck
jhid1nq,"The Deck keeps a lot of metadata around. It probably already had enough info to piece this together since shadercaches are always stored on internal storage where game files are stored on external storage.

jhfvv8h,"I loved the weapons in dying light and the hectic nature of running around when the lights got dark, but I feel the story and ambience so far (not finished yet about 20 hours in) of days gone is much better and I'm a sucker for a good story.

jhe3nf8,"The thing I love about the Deck is that it’s built on an idea: That since we own the hardware, we should be the ones in full control of how we choose to use it, and that there’s no “wrong” way to play.

I did find that occasionally when shutting deck off without closing game and turning it back on... the game (Hogwarts) would have in game voices speaking rapidly.  I quick close of program and reload fixed without tweaks.  I have heard that you can get better performance with adjustments... but I'm not a serious gamer.

The only 3rd party utilities I use are ProtonUp-Qt, Heroic, and ""Bonk(?)"" for SteamGridDB. I use sshfs and Barrier to connect the deck to my PC for the occasional file transfer, and to use a M+KB.

jhgv1ht,"My buddy is like you. I try to motivate him to using the desktop mode so he can learn some new things but he’s scared to mess with Linux. I recommend taking it little by little. If you know how to operate windows then Linux will be ver similar but if you don’t then here’s what I recommend learning/doing  first. 

1. Just learn how to search for stuff on the web browser by pressing the select button (idk what it’s called) + x it allows you to use the keyboard and by pressing those combinations again it will close it.

2. To download some apps, you can use the discover store to search for apps and download them. Like google, emulators, and ect. Just take the time to click and search and after a while, you will get better at it.

3 after getting used to that, I recommend downloading a program called wine. It even looks like this emoji 🍷. What this program does is allow Linux to run window programs. (Not all of them work but a good majority of them do). This will be the experimenting part that you will start to get better at. Even natives still have to tinker with programs sometimes just to see how they can get things to work.

4. Learning how to open folders and get to your destination. Take it little by little and you’ll soon get better at it. Heck even I’m still learning where some places are.


And from there you will slowly grow your knowledge. Reddit is a great place to ask questions and get answers I am by no means a native to linux because I only started using it since I bought my deck but I can tell you now, I know how to navigate the software pretty good but it came with trial and error.",SteamDeck

jheduys,"LOL, I had my deck all of two days before I had it open and tinkering.  Upgraded from the stock 64GB eMMC to a 1TB NVMe SSD, and installed a Jsaux clear back plate.  Then installed Cryoutils and Chiaki4Deck.  I do have to give Valve credit for making the deck easy to work on!",SteamDeck
jhedxrz,"I used to need around with stuff a lot to see what I could get working. Ice tried most of the stuff I wanted now, though, so I mostly just play games on it",SteamDeck
jhee466,I'm doing both,SteamDeck
jheehdp,"The only ""tinker"" I did was install windows on a SD card so I can play Destiny  on the go.",SteamDeck
jheem9m,"The only tinkering I’ve done is set up maybe 3 plugins(boot animation, protondb, and I just downloaded storage cleaner with hopes of my shader cache clearing up some). Other than that, just playing my steam games and WoW. I seriously can’t get over how easy it is to play WoW mobile.",SteamDeck
jheemd4,"I've basically just done 4 things on my 64gb:
1. Upped UMA buffer to 4gb through the bios
2. Moved Compatdata and Shadercache to SD card and linked it back to the main folder.
3. Yuzu, PCSX2, Retroarch for tons of games.
4. Warpinator for all file transfers between Linux and Windows.

Everything else is just Steam games",SteamDeck
jheewdt,"Meeee I'm a pretty basic gamer. I bought the Deck, bought 10 games on the steam sale and have just been...playing them. No changing or tinkering. The furthest I've gone is to lower the FPS lol.",SteamDeck
jheezkp,I pay for the device so I am going to fully utilise the value.,SteamDeck
jhef2fo,The only time I tinkered with it was when my fan went out and I didn't want to send it back. I do occasionally use it for web browsing or watching Hulu or something but nothing crazy.,SteamDeck
jhef2za,I juts straight up play games of steam and I’m loving it,SteamDeck
jhef32v,I'm definitely in the not tinkering club. Just download the games and play em!,SteamDeck
jhefi3j,All i did was replace my ssd and download emulators. Everything else is fine for me,SteamDeck
jhefvm3,Same. I just use it as is and everything is great enough for me!,SteamDeck
jhefwg3,Vanilla all the way.,SteamDeck
jhefxts,"Yeah. We just deck, I think is the parlance.",SteamDeck
jhefz1h,I changed the hard drive. It was actually pretty easy. I just took my time. I haven't done any software alterations or add ons yet but I have been looking at Cryo Utilities. But for the games I'm using the deck for I don't need to adjust frame rates or graphics settings,SteamDeck
jheg00z,"I’m just playing it straight up. I used to be on beta channel and adding plugins but now I just simply wanna play. I don’t even have emudeck setup anymore I just use retroarch because it has cloud saves natively. 

No hate to the people tinkering, but I’m the type of person that will tinker all day and never play a single game, which is silly so I stopped.

I also don’t enjoy the brand of person that is confused on why people aren’t adding 50 plugins to their Deck. 

I can simply say “I hope [feature] gets added.” And someone will scream “WELL YOU KNOW THERES A PLUG-IN RIGHT?!”

I’m a stock settings kinda guy now. The plug-ins glitches out multiple times and I said nope. Never again.",SteamDeck
jheg32b,I wasn't for a while then had the urge to. Considering there's a tutorial for almost everything you'd want to do it just makes tinkering alot easier and accessible,SteamDeck
jheg4pl,"I haven’t tinkered with anything except controller settings or occasionally the in-game graphics settings. No HW mods, no cryoutilities, nothing else. 512GB model.",SteamDeck
jheg54d,I just use it for vampire survivors. No tinkering necessarily.,SteamDeck
jheg9qx,Do what you want,SteamDeck
jhega6t,"Depends on what you define as “tinkering”
I use some tool to make my non-Steam games launch seamlessly, including game streaming. One way or another, I find methods to avoid other launchers (or simply hide them from view) to give a seamless console-like experience.",SteamDeck
jhegeh7,"My tinkering consists of things that don't require ""dialing in"" if it can help, and I just need to run a program then that's awesome! I've loved the steam deck, and since I figured out how to stream/ play games from my PC, it's amazing at home on the couch!",SteamDeck
jhegg1v,"Yeah! The most I’ve done is go into desktop mode install battle.net / world of Warcraft and ea/madden. I don’t see the need to do all this crazy stuff to it. 

It’s good enough for who it’s for (me).",SteamDeck
jhegm82,For the money it’s a great extra. It’s a nice bonus but I prefer my pc,SteamDeck

jheh7o0,Same. I've got too many games I want to play and have been playing to waste time not playing games on it.,SteamDeck
jhehatb,"I tinkered mine just enough to get emulators and roms on it. Now it's a vpw2 machine, basically",SteamDeck
jhehd6y,"I don't, I find it tedious and really annoying.  Most mouse and keyboard peripherals don't work properly.  Everything is slow in desktop mode. The most I do is add mods to things and that's a chore to even get it in the proper files.  Also, fun fact I'd if you have a ps5 controller connected and a wireless keyboard and track pad mouse setup. The ps5 controller has major interference with it and will override your track pad making it useless.  I just want a mouse and keyboard to be fluid and its not. So yes, I basically just use the deck as is because even thinking about doing an emu deck sounds exhausting when navigating files takes twice as long..",SteamDeck
jhehh82,"Yes, same here. I’ve had it since last year. I believe u got it in July of 2022 and it was the 512 model. I haven’t even used an SD card as of yet. Just how it’s been out of the box. I am going to get the official dock this June/July. And possibly a 512 to 1gb SD card but it’s been all just out of the box so far and I’ve enjoyed it quite a bit. Probably done most of my gaming this past year on it as well.",SteamDeck
jhehhxd,"Non tinkerer here, having too much fun playing the games I didn’t play on my pc on my deck",SteamDeck
jhei0dm,I haven’t until recently. I installed Cryoutilities to manage my shader caches and ended up clearing almost 40gb from my internal drive,SteamDeck

jhei3cf,"I put a screen protector and a vinyl skin on, on day one. But I've just been playing as normal since then. It really is a fantastic little device for the price of it.",SteamDeck
jhei4pp,"I bought my deck with the sole purpose of being a party jukebox I could carry around to places. (Jackbox, rifftrax, etc.)

I don’t play portable games, I don’t commute and I always have access to a top of the line PC or most consoles on a home theater system.

This thread is basically the only time I had a reason to post in this sub! There’s dozens of us I swear!",SteamDeck
jhei5sv,"I use it to play games , only “tinkering” i’ve done was some sd card but it works well for travelling.",SteamDeck
jhei7y5,I’m not. But I don’t know Jack shit about computers (console player). I already had to factory reset because of shaders- I am family sharing my sons Steam account and tried nearly everyone of his games. 256 model with a 256 SD (since upgraded to a 512). I now install everything on SD. Couldn’t figure out how to delete shaders.,SteamDeck

jheik2u,"Tinkering is using.

Hope this helps",SteamDeck
jheiqw5,"I’m happy to use mine as it is right now. I got the 64gb version and as a pc gamer I know already that may become an issue at some point in the future but right now it isn’t, I bought a 512gb high end Micro Sd card and that serves quite happily to store my steam games. When the OS and system files start to make the 64gb internal drive a problem I’ve seen the guides and know what I need to do to upgrade that. But for now, the sd card suffices",SteamDeck
jheiwin,"CryoUtilities and set Vram to 4GB. Thats the minimum anyone should do to be able to play many games that stutter/micro freeze. Using the latest proton build also helps. These things only require 15minutes to do, and they are mostly set and forget things. Without these minimum fixes, its better to just go back to the Nintendo Switch.",SteamDeck
jhej0zo,"I did set up EmuDeck but after that was configured I've been strictly using it for gaming, both Steam and non-Steam.

That said, I've thought about getting a second one to use as a really portable development device lol. My laptop is fine, and honestly the second SD would probably just end up being used for co-op games lol.",SteamDeck
jhej63v,Just play games. Unless it doesn't work I Dont tinker.,SteamDeck
jhejksj,Anybody else not tinkered with it or had the time to play for any amount of time as well...... 🥲,SteamDeck
jhejn9b,Same. I just use it to play my steam library and only adjust whatever stock settings are available.,SteamDeck
jhejre7,"Me! Lol! I'm not very tech savvy, plus I'm very simple and easy to please lol, I'm content with everything the Deck does, it honestly blows my mind. I never imagined as a kid I'd be playing all the games I love and have grown up with on the go, and I also never thought when I played Elden Ring for the first time I could play it at work on my lunch break lol. 

I think it's fascinating all the things people can get it to do, and how capable the Deck is, I just personally don't have the desire to mess around with it too much. It does everything I want/need it to do.",SteamDeck

jhellrm,I’m running mine stock. I’ve had no need to do anything to it yet.  When it starts having trouble running stuff I’ll mod it then.  Only thing I’ve done is plug in a usb mini fan into the dock so it blows cool air on the back of the SD.,SteamDeck
jhelq1s,"I got the Deck because my partner had a windfall and got a gaming PC a few years back and I could finally decide for myself if I was a PC Gamer™ properly for the first time in my life and I'm... just not, largely for all those tinkering reasons you outlined.

But I have always been aware that mentality locks me out of lots of stuff, which Deck ownership has largely let me access in a form factor I enjoy. 

With Deck I can be a puny console gamer as I so enjoy being, but also with added potential for mods and so on.

I have, of course, invariably fallen down the tinkering rabbit hole with the Deck anyway though, almost as if they planned it all along...",SteamDeck
jhelu2x,"I use a few things like EmuDeck for convenience, but I've done no hardware tinkering. I intend to put a 2tb drive in though at some point",SteamDeck
jhem3fx,I hear you OP. For the first couple months I didn’t do anything but play games. Last few weeks I started messing with plug-ins and customizing themes and boot vids. Downloading all the recommended decky plugins. It’s a lot of fun and I’ve been really surprised how much extra power you can get out of this thing. God I can’t say it enough. I love my steam deck so much. Pretty much became my exclusive gaming system and has given me a gaming life back after getting old and having kids and working startups that required a lot of hours. Just love it. Sorry for going OT.,SteamDeck

jhem9mx,"I’m a non tech guy and have emudeck and CryoUtilities installed. To be honest not sure if can tell what CryoUtilities does necessarily as I admit my games all seem to run as I would expect and I don’t think I am pushing the envelope of the steam deck capabilities.

Emudeck has been fun as I have been able to re-live my hey day of gaming my PS2 and PS3 days! Although I want to also try sega CD NHL 94 as I played that game to death with the piped in music.",SteamDeck

jhen693,"This is me.  I have built my own PC's and love to tinker and tweak my laptop and my pc to maximize performance.  However, I have only used my switch in it's ""out of the box"" state.

I have mainly been playing Elden Ring, Days Gone, and RDR2.  So far I have not experienced any need to drive me to tinker with Cryo or Plugins.  

Also, the consistent updates from Steam make me reluctant to invest too much time into tweaking as it seems Steam is very focused on unleashing more potential from the Deck that I would not want my time in tinkering to be erased with future updates.",SteamDeck
jhen6j5,"What's great about the deck is that you can really use it anyway you want, I just use it to play pc games not emulators or anything but some people buy it as a retro emulator for example. It's pretty easy to tinker with the deck but if you're not interested in the other stuff it can do that's completely understandable",SteamDeck
jhena1i,Me. But I don’t use it much. Thinkin of selling it,SteamDeck

jheo65e,Anyone got any good yt video guides on setting up the most useful plugins and emus on deck? Cuz honestly i dont have any bc i just was too scared to look for them,SteamDeck
jheo7fq,I don't. I love it as is. I did a little emudeck but once I had to tinker with stuff I was over it. That's why I don't usually like PC gaming. I want to boot up and go. I usually stick with deck verified games and some playable depending on the restrictions,SteamDeck

jhepg0r,"Well, I installed Proton-GE because it's generally helpful for games that are not Verified or Playable according to Valve, and I have a handful of those.

I tweak settings a little for every game to get a good balance of performance and battery life. I care a lot about battery life and the out of box experience usually has room for improvement in that regard.

I might install some emulators, but haven't yet, so much else to play. Haven't installed any non-Steam games yet either, though there are a handful I might try some day.

Oh, and I modded a few games here and there, pretty minor stuff and mostly copied over from my laptop I used to use for gaming. 

That's about it. I spend almost all my time on Deck gaming and very little time in desktop mode or tinkering.",SteamDeck
jhephkt,I’m tinkering because i like it and it’s fun for me! Shure you can just Play out of the box but I think it just depends What you want to do with it and its great to have freedom of choice :),SteamDeck
jhepiet,I am like you. Pure gaming console. I feel like adding any extra software could just mess it up or slow it down.,SteamDeck
jhepkps,Yup I haven't tinkered with mine since I got it a couple weeks ago. It's been able to play all of my games just fine. I finally ordered a skin and grips for the deck to personalize it more. Going for a fallout themed deck,SteamDeck

jherzk8,"Other than sticking the stuff for GE and emulators on so that they're their if I need them and don't have internet that's true for me.

I've got no real interest in some of the MOD or tweak tools. The performance for me is fine and other than occasionally needing a GE proton version I don't need to play with it to get things working.

I've dived into the spending more time tweaking a thing than playing. And the decks actually meant to be the solution for that for me not another venue for it.",SteamDeck

jhesmy2,I only installed Cryotools and that actually all made the difference.,SteamDeck

Both are valid ways to use the Deck, and Valve has made it pretty clear that they want to support both types of users.

jhex4nl,"Same here. Im way to paranoid and not well off enough to be buying another system if something goes wrong with my trying to tinker with it. Would I like to try cryoutilities and see how it feels? Sure. Would I like to try play a bunch of emulators? Sure. But no way am I risking it with my budget.

Also, Im kind of lazy. I dont even like switching to desktop mode on my SD, so meh.",SteamDeck
jhex7aq,"I don’t tinker with utilities - but I do use the SteamOS power limits (TDP), frame limits, and GPU limits when I am playing docked vs portable. 

I abandoned Sony consoles back in the early PS3 era when my backwards compatible model died and they were pushing the slim. The deck has been my portal to Sony exclusives, played on a TV in the living room - and 1080p in some of those titles takes some light tinkering.

I also use the desktop mode as a portable DAW with my travel sound card, Bitwig Studio runs great. It performs on par with or even better than our older gen Intel MacBook Pro - easily handles 50+ track projects when powered off the wall.",SteamDeck
jhex8qk,"I tinkered with mine a lot when I first got it, but now I really only use it for games that work well on it without a lot of drama. The most ""tinker"" thing I do is add emulated games to Steam by hand, usually only a couple at a time.",SteamDeck
jhexacd,"I would find some tweaks to install. Deckyloader at least just to have a plugin system that will be the one that grows over time. 

As for hardware tinker. I still don't know if I would wanna upgrade the SSD. Hear about how careful one had to be retightening the screws else you get screen bleed.",SteamDeck
jhexoon,I'm pretty much the same but only due to limited free time in life.  The most tinkering I did was change my loading video and install a PlayStation Remote App.,SteamDeck
jhextmh,"No I like to enjoy games lol. Not saying you need emudeck or custom loaders or anything, but at minimum you should check settings on every game you play on PC. Not every game auto adjusts to your hardware for best performance.",SteamDeck
jhexz1f,"I changed the vram to 4gb and installed cryoutilities. That's about it other than the booting videos. It takes less than an hour to do all of that and just makes it seem a bit better. Some games run smoother because of those changes, that's about it.",SteamDeck

I haven’t tinkered beyond that, and probably won’t. I thought I would set it up for Emulation and stuff but I have such a back log that I won’t even bother for a while. 

Had the deck a month, in 2020-2022 I finished Elden Ring, that was the only game I had time to play and complete. In one month with the Deck I have finished Spyro 1 and 2, Bioshock 1, Party Hard, Crash 1, currently playing Dredge, will play Control next.",SteamDeck
jheyqyk,"I tinker it to the point where I have a few emulators as well as epic installed, that's enough for my uses",SteamDeck

jhezc8n,"I did for the longest time, and just this week, my wife mentioned she’d never played the original Animal Crossing and wanted to try it out, so I went and get emudeck and which sent me down a retro rabbit hole of game hunting and adding bios - all has gone quite smoothly so far. It’s opened up a new level of deck appreciation.",SteamDeck

jhf0hjd,Yeah I'm just playing games too. Nintendo switch games,SteamDeck
jhf0laf,"Zero modification, had the deck for close a year. Went from maybe 20 games on steam to roughly 450. There are some games and emulation I would like Diablo and Zelda. However, with an ever growing backlog I just play what I can and will never run out of games to play.",SteamDeck
jhf0uwx,"I spend for the “high end” model specifically because I didn’t want to spend the time and effort tinkering.  

Yes I’m aware there are “cheaper” ways to get the same or better hardware stats starting from the baseline model, but I also locked in the model I chose before I knew it would be a solid year before it shipped.   

Plus I do place a value on my own time which tends to be overlooked by a large portion of the modding community.  If I expect labor to be a factor in car repairs, I try to assume my own labor should be a consideration as well.

jhf1thv,"I'll add something new to my deck when it matters. I think people can over value the potential to do everything all at once. You can spend hours preparing for every possibility and then only use 10% of your new capability, or you can wait until you identify the 10% that matters and then only spend time adding that utility.",SteamDeck
jhf1xl8,If you don’t count emulation then yeah for sure. Emulators are game changing on the SD.,SteamDeck
jhf2h53,"That’s why it’s such an awesome device. You have the OPTION to tinker with it as you please, or just play games from your steam library. It’s something the console gaming market has needed for a long time. But most if not all consoles, you are stuck to the performance, or games for that system, and that’s completely ok ✅ but it also opens up for us pc gamers that like to improve and build on something. I’m loving the steam deck so far.",SteamDeck
jhf2oyi,"Me. I've added emudeck/emulators and some roms. Aside form that, I'm just literally using it to play games.

Haven't been successful at playing switch gsmes on it yet, but I've got a switch so I'm not too worried.",SteamDeck
jhf2rqe,Yeah this was me. Just downloaded a few games and settled on playing Dinkum. I recently downloaded crypto utilities (think that’s what it’s called) because it was so easy to install and set up but I can’t tell a difference in dinkum.,SteamDeck

jhf3vuq,The only thing that I did was install plugins like decky loader it was very easy,SteamDeck

Screen flickering when docked on the tv.  Changed the display to 1080p and it doesn't flicker anymore.  

Last thing I'm doing is a new controller.  Using a usb connected Series X controller for now, but have the 8bitdo 2.4ghz ultimate controller on the way.",SteamDeck

jhf7j0l,Yup,SteamDeck
jhf7me1,"Same. The whole reason I bought a Steam Deck in the first place was because I have no experience tinkering with PC stuff, I’ve only ever played on consoles.

jhf7un9,"Honestly emulation was one of the biggest draws to getting a Steam Deck, most of the stuff you don't need to tinker with I could get on PS5 or Switch. 

I'd say my game time on Deck is 50/50 between my Steam Library and emulation. I probably wouldn't have paid out the cost of a Deck purely for the exclusive stuff that is directly on Steam and not available elsewhere.

That said, now I have it, I find I buy games on Steam rather than Switch now because Steam will be more forwards compatible.",SteamDeck
jhf7w2m,"The most 'tinkering' I do is using the deck as a normal PC in desktop mode when docked half the time.  And also using desktop mode to set up some non-steam games to work in gaming mode (FFXIV, Minecraft).  I do have decky installed, but it was just for stuff like setting artwork using SteamGridDB and updating flatpacks from gaming mode, lol.",SteamDeck

jhf8ip9,"I just play my bog standard steam library games, if I start tinkering I’m gonna break something!",SteamDeck
jhf8j4f,I haven't yet but part of it is because I never really gamed on a PC with the exception of D2 Load. I am not familiar with modding and such and a little scared since I am not a techie guy. But I do want to do some so I can play games like Diablo on this,SteamDeck

jhf998k,Nah man just keep playing with the stock setting you aren't cool enough to get the best performance.,SteamDeck
jhf9bvu,"Yeah that’s me, I don’t know anything about computer science, barley change any settings, just play steam games. I did follow a YouTube tutorial to get the steam version of fall guys running on it cause I’m hooked on that game",SteamDeck

jhf9gt4,"Not much tinkering going on here, though I would like to add an external fan if I can find a decent one",SteamDeck
jhf9oao,I'd assume 80 percent of the people who own it may have only at the most used decky or done nothing to their deck and play it as is. Things you see on Reddit make up a very very small percentage of the user base same with YouTube and other social outlits,SteamDeck
jhf9obg,"I tinker... why? Simply because I can. If there's a setting to change, it will be changed at some point 

90% of my games will run fine first try, but if I can eek out a little more performance or efficiency you can bet I'll find out how to. As for that other 10%, I just want to make it run, even if I'll never actually play it beyond seeing my work be successful 

Will I appreciate that slightly more pretty scene? No. Will those 12 extra frames help me? No. How about the extra 30 minutes afforded by limiting wattage and clock speeds? Maybe it's useful twice a year",SteamDeck
jhf9q4q,Depends on what tinkering means? Haven't used Decky loader but use CryoByte utilities.,SteamDeck
jhf9vcf,"I should install the new fan because the wheeze is super distracting. But I don't really want too. 

Same for dual booting windows,I'd rather not, me and Linux aren't friends even if I wanted too so I'll probably ruin it.",SteamDeck
jhfa1lr,"For me, sometimes the process of making something work is more fun than actually playing the game.

I got KH2 randomizer working on the deck, which took bottles, navigating programs with no UI, installing things with scripts, and eventually adding it all to steam and making it work, and I've sunk less than an hour into the game after all that work.

I just enjoy the process of getting something to work, moving on, then playing it later if I finally want to. Most of the games I actually end up playing through on deck are ones that require no initial setup and just worked properly from the start, but I really enjoy tinkering and messing with stuff to get it just how I want to.",SteamDeck
jhfa42l,Setting it up to seamlessly play stuff from my free Epic library is about the only thing I’ve done beyond stock. Also using cryoutilities to reduce crashing,SteamDeck
jhfa56k,"While I intend to tweak and mod later, for now I'm content with cursing at EA's launcher until Mass Effect legendary edition loads lol. About the only real tweak I've done was set the Gamescope stats to occupy the top black bar when i set games to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. It's only 80px tall but that's a total of 102,400 pixels the Deck doesn't have to worry about lol.

Or to really blow your minds... 2.66x the pixels displayed by the Gameboy Advance! That all fits in the tiny 40px wide strip at top and bottom lol

The other tweak is switched to Old fan curve when I'm outside, and new fan curve inside (or just when it's cool weather)",SteamDeck

jhfh79p,"First of all - I guess I envy you. If you're happy with it the way it is, that's honestly great.

What I've personally done: 1. I've installed Fantastic - a plugin that allows you to have more fan control. Honestly, this one is the only mandatory one for me. I played a lot of undemanding games, which with the default SD settings means that the fans don't have to run at all, until the components heat up enough, then they kick in into quite fast RPM, then they turn off completely again. This was really distracting to me.

2. Vibrantdeck plugin - simply just better screen saturation.

3. PowerTools plugin - i wanted more charging control, e.g. being able to force charging off when wanting to play plugged in with a partially depleted battery to conserve battery health. Honestly, in my experience, the battery control has a mind of it's own most of the time, so I couldn't even really recommend it at this time. Maybe it's actually not even worth it fussing about with this, but who knows how the battery will hold up with in time?",SteamDeck

Something like Decky Tools, Cyro Utilities quite literally take a minute each.

Decky Tools let's you change boot animations, themes, really cool stuff.

Cyro Utilities gives you slightly better performance in most games.

jhfktnq,"I tinkered, like swapping out for a 1TB ssd, using cryoutilities to tweak settings, just general comfort/performance increases, installing emudeck,...
But I do just play. Those were initial things I did just to get more comfortable with the device and tinkering is what I enjoy. After building a new computer or reinstalling windows, I set things up just the way I like and then just not tinker much either.

Did the same with my switch, my model can handle cfw out of the box, so I've set that up. Now I can play it with whatever controller I want, backup saves, install my games to the device instead of switching cards, ... And I'm sure it's why I played it quite a bit because of it. Of course, my Steam Deck replaced it entirely (that is, until the new Zelda game is out).

You absolutely don't have to tinker. I can advise cryoutilities to get better performance, but if you like it, then don't. Oh, and the plugin loader to find tested settings to have great performance but lower battery usage.

jhfowp2,"I literally had my deck for an hour before tinkering with it because Desktop mode doesn’t have a built in On Screen Keyboard without turn on Steam for whatever forsaken reason.

Plus I’m a huge fan of Mecha and Anime games, so they either don’t work cuz of EAC or just meh cuz they aren’t fully supported.

It was pure luck that DNF Duel ironically ran better on the SD vs PC since the screen tearing issue didn’t exist on the SD. Then luckily Capcom didn’t put EAC on Battle Network Legacy Collection so I can play that online with no problem. 

I had to do A LOT of digging to find Linux EAC just to run Gundam Evolution on it. Granted I can’t play online but I can at least do everything else on it.

Then again if I wanted to fix those issues I would have to at least put Windows on it at the cost of other issues.

If I were to recommend one almost-zero-effort, lots of bang for your buck software mod, even if you did nothing else, it would be downloading the Decky Loader/Vibrant Deck combo.

Only thing i would do is if anything broke to just go to the ifixit website and order replacement parts( hopefully that's a long way down the road). It really does work good right outta the box.

Valve has done enough to build up the platform to satisfy people like me who just want games to work out of the box. When I saw the SD Verified program, that was the final factor that convinced me to get the Steam Deck.

I can get most AAA games to run at 35FPS max settings and indie titles (and even DOOM) at 70FPS. That extra 5-10 FPS (~15% performance increase) with less noise just looks and feels a bit nicer than stock. I hear that extra fan attachment JSAUX sells ACTUALLY does something for temps, but that's crossing the line for me. XD If I have to bring something else with me, I don't want it. 

But yeah, CryoUtilities 2.0 (with RAM at 4GB in BIOS) and Power Tools, that unlocks SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading?) are a must. Having the saturation up a bit is also nice with the Vibrant Deck (?) plug-in, and then having the HLTB (How Long To Beat) as well as the random game selector plug-ins also just make it easier to get to and through games when I can't pick.

jhg8yy0,"Decky is so easy to install now.  I would definitely have a go at that.  And it is so easy to add plugins once you do the install. Here are my faves from that suite:

The Vibrant Deck plugin makes colors so much better.

My favorite of all though is that it adds ""How Long to Beat the Game"" info directly on the title splash of each game once you've clicked on it.  It really takes away the intimidation factor on some of the games I snag and it also helps me choose which one I want to dive into based on how much time I have in my upcoming schedule.

There are more but these two are my must haves",SteamDeck
jhg91cm,I tinker with the os for fun and sideload games via their launchers and all that; messing with weird proton versions and even put some of my fav linux stuff on there. But 95% of the time im firing it up and gaming.,SteamDeck

jhgddak,"I've probably opened the deck more than I've played it lol. The haptics power supply on the right board is connected by a jumble of soldered wires and spare cable connectors from a repair I did, the RB and LB buttons have been completely replaced with the switches of Xbox One controller Sync buttons (they're a lot clickier, pleasant surprise after the old ones started to show age), the shell and triggers have been swapped out with the iFixit replacements, and the shell itself has been touched with a teensy bit of vaseline around the plastic connection tabs to eliminate any creaking.

I have not opened up mine since Valve spooked me into not upgrading my 2230 drive while under their warranty.

If you don't want to tinker with it... then don't do it. Tinkering has a very broad term on the Steam Deck too, you have to play with all the onboard options to get the performance you want out of EVERY game.

jhfvqp1,">Very basic question, but I feel like I'm doing my tinkering wrong. Are you all just switching to desktop mode and navigating using the gamepad and trackpads? 

For all the tinkering, you basically need to do it in desktop mode. Everything you could want is either from the discover store and requires configuration after installation, or you are downloading something from a website like emudeck.com or something else which requires konsole.",SteamDeck
jheq6bt,"Depends. If you can do it in gaming mode it usually works better in gaming mode since that is what the deck is designed for. But you specifically need the desktop version to do certain things like downloading non steam games into the deck or going into the filepaths. Basically if you could do it on the PC without ever opening up a non steam program then there's no reason to leave game mode, if you need to open non steam programs to do something (including any kind of file explorer) then (edit: ~~gaming~~ desktop mode) is the way you want to go.

Personally I think desktop mode without peripherals is fine, totally serviceable, if you just need to pop over to desktop to do some quick tinkering.",SteamDeck
jhgh8mq,"I have done a ton of tinkering with my deck. The only real time i HAD to have a keyboard is when i used a usb drive with smokeless ui to access hidden parts of the steam decks bios to do an undervolt before trips and an overclock when I dont need long battery life. This takes me about 30 seconds to do now that i know my decks limits. Fun thing is on undervolt in re4 remake capped at 30fps i get an extra 20 to 30 minutes of battery compared to stock. On overclock my deck went from 40fps in cyberpunk to a near locked 60 too...granted battery doesnt last more than roughly 50 minutes buuuut lol.

Regardless, those are the only two things i needed a keyboard for. Anything else is 100% serviceable with the stock deck controls.",SteamDeck

Beyond that, I can't quite figure out how people end up troubleshooting issues with any of them or really optimizing the configuration of emulators in gaming mode. I mean, I understand mechanically how to navigate in desktop, but the why of selecting individual options in Linux is a little mysterious.",SteamDeck

jhm3u1q,I’ve been obsessed with BTD6,SteamDeck
jhlvshu,"It really depends on your taste. I’ve found a ton of use for my deck that I never expected, and went the opposite way, recently selling my gaming Pc.

I find a lot of joy in the easy to play games, that I can pick up to play for short periods, but don’t completely forget how yo play if I don’t play for a month or so. Some recent examples are Dredge (awesome RPG like game), no man’s sky (though this one can be hard to pick back up after a long period), cities skyline, bravely default 2, Skyrim, and Forza Horizon 5.

On the completely unexpected side of thing(some of which require desktop mode), I do most of my 3D print modeling, 3D print slicing, and fine desktop games. One thing I’ve found especially pleasing, is leveraging the decks ability to play a game both in desktop and handheld mode. For instance, cities skylines plays well in hand held, but very few mods are usable due to their reliance on keyboard shortcuts and commands. So I’ll often “rough in” a city expansion while on the couch, then dock later and fine tune everything with mods later using keyboard and mouse. I know this isn’t directly what you asked for, but just some ideas of how to breath some life into the deck.

If you have a solid desktop, it’s hard not to play it. My gaming pc was having some issues with the mobo, so I was in the unique position of spending $500 updating mobo, processor, etc or buying a deck for the same. I rolled the dice on the deck and have been super happy (enough to part out and sell the working pieces of my desktop).

Hopefully some of my couch game suggestions above help you out. Good luck!",SteamDeck

I actually prefer using the ""mouse,"" because the trackpad is a lot easier for my tiny baby hands to reach than the c-sticks. It just moves and feels so intuitive that my thumb naturally gravitates there anyway.

Not just for use in the menus, either. I use the trackpad to move the camera around. It took about a minute of getting used to, but once I did, oh my God, controlling the camera with the trackpad is just so much more responsive. The c-stick just moves it way slower and in clunkier movements for me. It feels awful.

I used to use a GPD Win with NorthernUI controller support for Oblivion. It worked, but still felt so clunky to me. Not so with the trackpad on the Deck--plays smooth as silk.

Oblivion isn't the only game I enjoy the trackpad/mouse with, either. Probably the best thing about the Deck's built-in controller imo, which really sets it apart from the Switch and other handheld competitors.

If you cancel that dialog and then navigate somewhere else, like documents, it should stop happening.  
Dolphin (file manager) remembers every folder you had open and you were trying to open /var/efi which requires root privileges (same password as your account, it's similar to Windows asking for permission with UAC).

Does it handle emulation any good",SteamDeck
jhm45uo,You can run bf2042? Do you actually get kills? Handheld mode?,SteamDeck
jhlqcui,"Yes you can just put Windows on it and run anything natively. 

It’s not as simple as just installing Windows, there are some other steps you have to take to get everything working like controllers and WiFi on Windows. Not a seamless setup, but once it’s setup it works great.

The Deck is as powerful as a midrange laptop, but the screen is low resolution (720p) so you can run pretty much every game. Newer demanding titles will run around 30fps at 720p. eSports are 60fps all day. Warzone runs around 40-50fps on low for reference.

Emulation performance is very good. GameCube and older all run really well. Every GameCube game I’ve tried has been flawless. 

Switch is hit or miss. Prime Remastered, Metroid Dread, Pokémon Diamond have been rock solid for me, but I’ve heard other games struggle. A lot of the switch performance issue are due to the fact that the emulators are not mature yet. So it’s getting better all the time.

I’ve only done emulation on SteamOS, but I imagine Windows performance is similar.",SteamDeck

If you’re okay with not being as good as you are on your desktop, they’re both perfectly playable.

I hadn’t been able to play any of my pc games for so long and finally I truly sat down and read up on the steam deck about a month ago. I’m so glad I did because I now have one and it’s a major game changer for me. I used to love playing WoW several years ago. And I had to stop because you know, life does that to you sometimes. I couldn’t dedicate the time to sit down and play at my pc. But now I can take my steam deck anywhere with me, kick on my hotspot and play WoW wherever.

Maddeningly, I explained to my wife a few times that my main reason for getting it wasn't to ""main"" the device, but rather to keep as an emergency option for times where I couldn't use my pc e.g. (and I literally used this as an example) if we ever had to go into hospital for extended periods of time. As it turns out, she was diagnosed with MS last year and we're at the hospital regularly now. Crazy how things turn out! If my steam deck broke tomorrow, I would order another ASAP.

When I realised, I was gutted but my deposit went down immediately (512GB) and from that day forth, never purchased another Switch game again (or any other game for that matter and focused on building up my Steam library). Sadly, I have an obsessive personality and the wait to actually hold my own in my hands, nearly drove me insane; it felt all consuming and for a year, all I did was consume every snippet of info from every source I could find to keep me going until I got it! I genuinely HATED the wait. I wanted to be one of the first. Call it FOMO, whatever. Anyhow, it was a year to the day ordered when mine finally arrived and it was and is everything I wanted and hoped it would and could be. I love it. The hype here, was fucking crazy. In my mind, it was the one device to rule them all and the trackpads were a deal maker for me. Could it be ‘better’ - of course, better screen, better battery and what not -  but does it need to be right now? To me, not at all. My money will be down for a Deck 2 instantly. No hesitation. 

I have many, many other consoles (retro gamer here) and I still have my Switch, my Vita, my Series X and a £4k PC upstairs with a G9 (not flexing at all, I just do) and yet my Steam Deck is my go to. The ease, the convenience, the experience and equally my experience with Valve and the hardware itself has been flawless. Not one problem. 

I’ve customised it with Decky, skinned it, upgraded it (512GB to 2TB) have a 1TB card in it and it’s used daily. It is MY deck! Currently tidying up all my emulators etc. and the list goes on.

jhqozeu,"Basically how to network 🛜 two decks together. Directly would be ideal, but isn't well developed on the deck. A hotspot device is a combination modem, router, and wireless access point. A portable hotspot creates a WiFi signal, connected to the internet via LTE or 5G cellular data (like the hotspot feature on phones). A hotspot device is usually preferred to a phone because it should have better battery life, and stronger signal from larger antenna 📶.

Travel routers were popular in the days when many places only offered wired internet, hence their declining popularity nowadays. They don't have a modem which makes them cheaper. They also usually offer NAS (Network Attached Storage) functionality, which allows one storage device to be accessed across the network. Some products were made with this specifically in mind, for example the Seagate wireless hard drive and SanDisk connect USB sticks (although neither example has Ethernet for wired networking).

But if two steam decks connected to the same network host device, such as the SanDisk connect, then they should be able to play lan games together. Or valve could make it easier to designate one steam deck as a network host for other decks with an update.",SteamDeck

jho851u,"Sure... I definitely need it for next week

I didn't said that, it would be better if steam just implemented it on its own, and it would be even more amazing if some one ends up doing it by themselves, just like the cryo utility's thing

steam link as far as i am aware steams the whole thing producing lag at least on the screen, maybe something on settings like ""enable deck control mode"" or something like that, and essentially work as a Bluetooth controller

If you can use your joy cons as controllers on steam why not the steam deck as a Bluetooth controller, that's the whole idea, if it exists (because the steam deck keeps surprising me all the time) awesome, if it doesn't, well, maybe some day it becomes real and that would be awesome, that's all",SteamDeck
jhpz130,"Ok so correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't steam link also steams the game?

Or is there a way to use steam link just to use the deck as a controller?

jhs7e0p,Why does it matter if the game is on the screen too?,SteamDeck
jht7gqg,"It requires Wi-Fi, doesn't it? If there was a Bluetooth version not only the battery consumption would decrease dramatically, but you could use it without Wi-Fi

And not everyone has stable WiFi, I tried the Steam link, my screen (on the deck) just froze, I could still play on my PC, but again, with Wi-Fi (and some lag)

And I know this would be absolutely absurd but imagine playing on a PlayStation or a switch with the weird USB adapter to connect other controllers (using seam Deck as one of those controllers) 

In it itself, it's just the idea that we ""technically"" have a fully functional controller with us, why not use it as such, if the joy-cons can be used separately from the switch, why not the steam deck as a controller

That's the whole idea

and what if Wi-Fi is not available, again, why not just Bluetooth",SteamDeck

Im the person who HAS to do all side missions. I’ve played oblivion so much I could do all side missions in order from memory!

For example — [Final Fantasy VII Remake](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/1462040/achievements). Only 27.9% of owners globally have earned the achievement for finishing the final chapter. And 3.6% have never earned the very first achievement for winning a battle. (Which is lower than I would have expected, honestly!)

1. in the games controller settings, goto action sets

If you want to go down that road it is possible to do more. The safest bet would be to increase the max boost clock on the CPU by 100-200mhz, keep the TDP the same etc, then when you have GPU clocks lowered it will be able to boost higher.

However let me point out again that doing such things is at your own risk, and especially if you undervolt there is a severe chance to brick your deck, the above said, it definitely **is** possible to bump up CPU performance a bit, the main risk is from increasing TDP/Temps or from undervolting.

Explore other things first and enjoy it how it is, if you get to a point where you really really want more out of it and are willing to take the risk, start out small like above and see if it helps, and don't get greedy, thats when things go wrong.",SteamDeck

modding the thing is super easy and you can very easily install titles from all 3 of those systems and have them run natively through the system with no emulating involved. even GBA roms are going to run natively if you use virtual console injections, thanks to original DS hardware still being in the system and THAT hardware already being backwards compatible with GBA.

getting an actual 3DS is also going to make the whole dual screen thing less of an annoyance.

Basically, if your looking for accuracy and comfort grab the 3DS. i'd specifically recommend the New 3DS XL.

Valve understanding how essential shader cache is, and yet choosing a 64GB home drive initially without the official support to move it to another disk was consciously insane.

Dude, I'm now playing games that I never got a chance to play in my teen years (i'm 35 now). This thing blows the Switch out of the water. I have like 70 games just from emulation alone across various consoles including PS2, PS3, Wii U, and even Switch lol. I got Metroid Prime Remastered on my Deck when it came out haha.

What really sold it for me was playing Doom Eternal on Ultra Nightmare settings on the Deck and getting a smooth 60fps. I had the same game on the Switch and it's SOOO much better on the Steam Deck! It's night and day. And I haven't even bought Elden Ring and FF7 Remake yet (I'll get those later). 

I had to sell my Switch, games, and accessories as a bundle and took a loss, but I wanted to sell it quickly to get the Deck. I would probably sell the console, games, and accessories separately to get the most $$$ back.

Also, if you do get the Steam Deck, I'd go with the 64gb model and get a 512gb Samsung Pro microSD card (they're like $50 right now). Hella worth it. You can always upgrade the internal SSD later on (it's easy to do).",SteamDeck

Maybe wait for Steam Deck 2?",SteamDeck
jhmd78l,"Yea. Steam Deck is great **value** for all it can do. But there will come a threshold of price where you are paying more than what it can do is worth. So if you’re in a country it’s not available, and have to pay 50% more … that may be it.

IMO it’s definitely better than a Switch, if only for all the games you have access to that you straight up would not have on the Switch. And many that exist on both that look better on Steam Deck because of the lacklustre textures on Switch; even with an OLED screen.

For probably a similar reason to why you have a Switch in the place, is the biggest perk of the steam deck; portability. You’re basically getting the PC-gaming library, with the ability to take it anywhere. And you can hook it up to your TV just like the switch and play it console-like like you did with the Switch.

jhk6iew,">Have you considered using another input for menu navigation instead? Left joystick, touchscreen, or even an otherwise unused left trackpad.

Yeah, in case with Risk of Rain 2 I use the left joystick + shoulder buttons instead for menus. But it then gets problematic when I like to (for example) open the player tab menu to hover over items with the cursor.

Since I use ""as joystick"" for the right joystick + gyro action on joystick touch (but without trackpad), the cursor is also too fast there. In some other games, the matter gets even hairier unfortunately. But I used Risk of Rain 2 as an example here.

I had seen that a workaround can be to create an action layer for this that I toggle with a button press. But before I do that (and making my configs too complex), I got really curious if there is perhaps a way to solve this at its root.

And if there sadly isn't, if there is a convenient alternative that I haven't thought of. What would you suggest as a binding here?

>a menu action set to activate **on cursor detection**

If it is a 64gb or 256gb, you could try using an automotive rubbing compound such as ScratchX, however I do not think that is going to help here because most mild abbrasives are not going to remove a scratch from a glass screen.   


Cerium oxide is something that I have heard can be used to remove scratches from glass, but keep in mind that it is a messy process and you could end up causing a warping / halo effect if you dont remove an equal level of glass across the board. You also may introduce other smaller scratches and imperfections during the process.  


With all of this said, the best thing you can probably do is to buy a screen protector and place it on top. The adhesive may help fill in some of the gaps from the scratch and will thus reduce the visual impact it has.

jhhv3c1,Not everything is available as a flatpack (from the discover store) so people want to use the AUR.

That's what systemd units are for. It shoudn't break anything, unless Valve makes some big changes (I'm not even sure what kind of changes might break it tbh), and even then, all your data should be safe in `/home/nix`. I have it on my deck for at least 2 major updates while switching between channels and it works as intended.

>And the article even explicitly points out that this is a prototype they're testing out to see how stable that kind of install is

That's not what was stated in article though. Installer is a prototype, not the method itself. Creating `/nix` and mounting `/home/nix` to `/nix` are pretty simple tasks that is hard to fuck up.",SteamDeck

Fair point. Although I'd personally still rather find something that doesn't require flipping readonly on/off, I'll concede that Nix looks like a good alternative.",SteamDeck

So technically, undervolting should be only done when knowing the risks, knowledge, and having the hardware to avoid a (potentially no longer free) RMA.

Edit: On this Youtube video the author [also says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GztHMm6lX_o&lc=Ugw5x0ZXhvJAi0w4h094AaABAg) in the comments the reset button combo is not enough when you ended up with an unbootable Deck.",SteamDeck

The 7950 takes several heating/cooling cycles to get settles in nicely and working better.  Especially after the first one or two cycles.  So if you ran the 7950 test right after install and then ran it with the backplate next, the 7950 would have been working better by that point.

It's hard to tell for sure based on screenshots tho because there's a ton of variables such as ambient room temp, how long was it running, what intensity was it pushed to in periods BEFORE the screenshot, etc. To really get data on the effect of the shells you need the deck in a mount and running in dry off a few mins standby and then roll through a tester on repeat for like 2 hours whilst recording temps.",SteamDeck

Had to stick a clip on plastic fan cover on the fan as the blades are exposed and you can stick your finger in it, ive seen less intrusive metal grilles i might stick on instead, bcuz metal > plastic imho and the metal ones arent as chunky.
