But the maintainers became too few and too slow to keep it viable as a rolling gaming distro, and with the recently announced switch to an immutable filesystem it no longer appeals to me. I'll just be sticking to Arch for the foreseeable future.

I also think OpenSUSE should be more popular. It's more user friendly than Arch and even gets updates sooner generally. It also treats KDE Plasma as its flagship DE, and I'd imagine at this point most gamers are on Plasma.",linux_gaming

If the vulkan driver version is the same (as I think it should be between opensuse tw and fedora 38 at the moment) and you also didn't somehow install amdvlk or amdgpu-pro vulkan on the opensuse machine, then the only other guess I have is the broken-by-default power management on rdna2.

Could be a Wayland/X11 thing, a lot of games runs faster on Wayland, but some tanks heavily.",linux_gaming
jibgl7g,"it could have to do with the quality of drivers provided on each distro/OS. to test it out, try dual booting fedora on the openSUSE one and see if there is any difference",linux_gaming
jibwbiu,"Somebody here had the stupid guess that it *could be* drivers. Lets start there. TW has newer mesa and newer kernel that has the AMDGPU module. No performance difference should be expected, of it there is any, TW should be a bit faster having more up to date graphic stack.

How are both CPU's set UP? Is XMP on? How is the infinity fabric set on both? FCLK:UCLK 1:1 or? How are they being cooled?

Let's go to the GPU side of things. I've had a few generations of AMD cars that just HAD to be undervolted in order to get temperatures in check and prevent throttling. Highly recommend taking a look at **corectrl**. On their default modes both my 580 and 6600XT would overhead and strat throttling. Was ablte to overclock my 580 to a stable 1400MHz while undervolting it from 1250mV to 1075mV. Before that it was throttling to 1200MHz. Same with my 6600XT. OC to 2700MHz and a 75mV undervolt to get it running at a constant 2700MHz.

That's just an example, but from my tests with AMD hardware, it might just be the GPU overheating. Simplest thing is to set a fan curve in corectrl and monitor the coreclock with mangohud.  


We also don't know how Re-BAR/SAM is set in BIOS on both machines. Having it ON on the fedora rig could explain it running faster.",linux_gaming

jibxs6l,Definitely not Picom unless a WM is used.,linux_gaming
jic2lut,shouldn't matter?,linux_gaming
jibwz8h,"Yes. GPU driver module is in the kernel. In both distros it is not modified. TW has a newer kernel, so has a newer module. Other part of the graphic stack is MESA. Both distros ship stock mesa. Fedora has a fairly recent mesa. TW has latest stable mesa. In both instanced TW should perform better having newer more optimized code for the hardware. In practice it is the same. I'm a long time TW user but have played around with Fedora too. u/lighttraffic comment just shows that he is unfamiliar with the graphic stack used under Linux for AMD.",linux_gaming

jibcvdp,"Thanks, that clears it up a bit",linux_gaming
jibpxgh,"That only selects the display language for the Steam client (and possibly some internal locale-relevant stuff), not the system locale (or even the display language for desktop mode), doesn't it? At least that was the case the last time I played around with this on my Deck. No Japanese input support, either.

*** 
You'd think one UTF-8 locale would be as good as any other, but many (most?) Japanese Windows games will simply refuse to run or not run properly unless run under Japanese locale. This is not a Linux-specific problem, it affects Windows just the same. It's worth noting that these games expect a [Shift-JIS / CP932](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_932_\(Microsoft_Windows\)) compatible environment under the hood, really, not Unicode.  
I suspect WINE pulls a lot of strings behind the scenes, sets a lot of compatibility options when it detects a Japanese locale, because it manages to run most things with `LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8` (sometimes `LC_ALL`) set for just the WINE process. I've only come across one or two that actually need `LANG=ja_JP.sjis` (which is a horrible hack on Linux, because it's *not* forward-compatible with Unicode).
***

Last time I looked, there wasn't a supported/elegant method of enabling Japanese support on the Deck, nothing that works without going read-write on the system image. Since I mostly play Japanese games these days, my Deck is (mostly) sitting in a drawer waiting until Valve get their act together. If broad availability in Japan won't do it, well ... I have a few ideas—but I'd rather play games in my limited free time, not tinker with something so basic. Normal desktop distros have had this down for decades now.",linux_gaming
jibj1w2,"Oh for sure, I'm just saying it's not really a crash, and the game would likely work totally fine and without issue if they just connected it to the network.

It definitely is a bad first impression. I think the store shares the bulk of the blame since it seems that they didn't test it beforehand, but Valve should probably make it clear that the games need to be started on network first.",linux_gaming
jibpz6k,"**[Code page 932 (Microsoft Windows)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_932_\(Microsoft_Windows\))** 
 
 >Microsoft Windows code page 932 (abbreviated MS932, Windows-932 or ambiguously CP932), also called Windows-31J amongst other names (see § Terminology below), is the Microsoft Windows code page for the Japanese language, which is an extended variant of the Shift JIS Japanese character encoding. It contains standard 7-bit ASCII codes, and Japanese characters are indicated by the high bit of the first byte being set to 1. Some code points in this page require a second byte, so characters use either 8 or 16 bits for encoding.

I say this because Goverlay sometimes does weird things on its own and messes up the .config files. In my experience at least.

You have shared the config file in Goverlay forum? they have see something wrong with it?

If the values you are adding are overlapping ones over others it may be related to the ""table_columns"" setting. Is just a blind shot but you can add that setting in the config file and increase the value (the default is 3).
Maybe other values such high and width fixed values, or activate hudcompact setting can help to short out some problems.

In any case the best way to configure Mangohud is start from a full featured MangoHud.conf file template. And from it add and remove things (at ~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf).

In my current machine (a Dell g15 5520) it comprised installing the right packages, blacklisting the nouveau module and appending nvidia_drm.modeset=1 to the kernel parameters and... That's it, really.

My dgpu (a RTX 3050) is selected automatically by vulkan apps, so for most games (including windows games via steam/proton, since they mostly use dxvk) and emulators I don't have to do anything else. If a game or app doesn't select or recognize my dgpu at first, I just start it with ""prime-run"" and I'm good to go.

The performance is what I expected from this card and from the look of benchmarks online I'd say it's the same I'd get on Windows. The overall experience is reasonably stable. The last time I had problems was about 3 months ago, because a driver update wasn't playing nice. I just rolled back to the previous version and updated again later when nvidia released a fix some days later.

Why the asterisk earlier, then? Well, there's Wayland... *Almost* everything works as it should, except for native WL apps running on vulkan. It's a [known bug](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/issues/72) that's supposedly being worked on, but with no fix in sight. Vulkan apps running through Xwayland run fine, though.

Those are not risks with incredibly low rates: it's basically the first thing people try to escape sandbox and that's the main reason why, besides a few ransomware, keyloggers have traditionally been the main ""threat"" under Linux.

And indeed a keylogger is probably the most realistic malware you can practically get out of X11, the other ""weaknesses"" aren't really that useful for malware - except in practice how often do you actually hear this happening? From a quick Google search all i could find (at least in the first couple of pages) were proofs of concept that it is technically possible (amusingly one of the results was about a Wayland keylogger) but no actual news of this happening in the wild.

I mean, what X11 allows an application to do is pretty much the same as what Windows allows applications to do and while malware keyloggers do exist on Windows you don't see everyone running for the hills because of that.

Meanwhile in both cases (X11 and Windows) being able to listen for system-wide key events is very useful for tools like xbindkeys (X11, listens for events), xdotool (X11, can generate events), AutoHotKey(Win32, both listens and sends events), AutoKey (X11, AHT alternative), etc. I myself also use that functionality very often via, e.g. OBS' global shortcuts for screen recording.

> Very concretely, what's the point of using Steam in flatpak with tightened permissions if the first random game you launch can use X11 API

FWIW i don't use Steam in Flatpak - or Flatpak in the first place as i find that every ""runtime"" installs pretty much an entire distro by itself and applications tend to replicate all sorts of libraries that already exist in the base system, both wasting a ton of disk space (which i don't have much of) without any real positive while not integrating as well with the rest of the OS as ""native"" installations.

What GamersNexus is saying kind of throws that into question.  There were recent BIOS updates released by the board vendors to limit VSOC voltage, but if that wasn't **the** root cause, then it might not have fixed anything and we could potentially still have issues.

It's basically been kind of a black mark with all kinds of drama over in /r/amd for the past few weeks.

AMD had less sway with MOBO manufactuers than Intel/Nvidia, as Ryzen wasn't a sales powerhouse until late in X570.

AMD didnt let them cook, MOBO manufactuers should know that these CPUs don't need 1.4V+ to function & have always pushed voltages too high for no real benefit, on both Intel/AMD.

Basically the design of the menu doesn't need to be changed, I like the way it looks, it just needs to be compacted and more efficient. Also, I would probably need to be told that there's stuff above ""Last Hope"", you should make it more clear that there's stuff above that.

That’s a clever touch, well done!

One way you might be able to reclaim some ergonomics/usability without sacrificing any of the flair could be pressing and holding a direction to quickly jump to the end of that branch in that direction if that makes sense 

This would make navigating menus a bit faster for when the novelty wears off for the player and if they need to, for example, tweak some video or audio settings real quick it won’t feel as tedious to click through.

Go with any of the mainstream distributions, almost all will be fine for gaming.

'beginner friendly' has gotten to be a rather meaningless term these days , you will have to learn new things.

Remember Linux is not windows, it is not windows with a new theme or other little changes, it is different at many fundamental levels.

Ubuntu is fine, mint is fine, I use pop_os, but really any of the mainstream distributions would work.

also there is /r/findmeadistro

ji6msdx,"As a beginner I found Ubuntu and Linux Mint both great. They tend to be the most easy to get started and when searching for issues on the web most people assume Ubuntu (Mint is an Ubuntu derivative) so guides and help tend to be super easy to find and follow.   

In my experience Ubuntu and Mint are quite strong usually in stability and you do get updates as needed. Both of them are on a 6 month release cycle. So you get a new version with all the newest versions of all the things. And you could get a LTS version as well if you wanted less changes.  As your hardware isn’t bleeding edge you should be good to with either of those two. 

Once you are comfortable with Linux as your daily driver you could consider a rolling release like openSUSE tumbleweed for bleeding edge and frequent updates. However it isn’t the most beginner friendly.",linux_gaming

Hmm, maybe.  It's most unlikely that your machine can run Windows 11, so even if you're running W10 on it, that EoL clock is now ticking.

As your hardware is old, you don't need to care about getting bleeding-edge kernel updates so you might as well go for whatever you feel like.

As for reinstalling, remember that this is free software, in both senses of the word.  You won't have to remember where you put your license key or what your account password is.  If you are unlucky and pick a distribution that later becomes abandoned, then you can just switch.

One thing I would say is that if this old PC does not have a solid state drive, get one.  SSDs are getting pretty cheap these days and even a SATA will make  phenomenal difference.  It's not impossible that your motherboard has an M.2 slot, so have a look!",linux_gaming

I understand Nobara isn't as popular today as Pop OS or something like that, but that does not mean it is being unused and will be abandoned. Far from it, there are a ton of us using Nobara. Just those YouTubers really like to say Pop is the *best* gaming distro. Also, like many others have said in reply to you, there is no best distro, any distro will do just fine. BUT, I do think some distros come pre packaged with more which would result in far less tinkering and an easier out of the box expierence. This is my expierence with Nobara. Ive also lived in Fedora for a while before, so if you would rather go with a Debian/Ubuntu derivative maybe Pop is better for you. At the end of the day it's just preference, but i'd absolutely recommend at least watching some videos and read up on some documentation about both Nobara and Pop to really see some differences that come in both. [GloriousEggroll ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9khdYpMI5s) also has this really cool video walking through a flowchart of how steamplay/proton works and talks about Nobara in addition.

ji6ob6m,"no i wouldn't say there's anything you ""must do"" after installation. it'll show notifications for updates and things and there's a software center to install the things you need including steam.
you might need to install nvidia drivers but I think it prompts for that during install or just after. if not it's a quick Google to get them installed.

as for other hardware, unless it's truly exotic I'd use a take it or leave it approach at first. if it doesn't work, and you can't get it working easily, maybe try something else, your investment is so small at this point it's probably easier to try a few things to find what works for you rather than spend days configuring things.

i can't imagine why a keyboard wouldn't be detected, it's one of the most basic things. but some Bluetooth chips do have issues with linux, in that they've not released drivers for them or allowed anyone to have the specs to write our own drivers. so yeah, Bluetooth usb dongles are probably the weakest link at the moment. most work, some just won't. i can't really tell you which is which, best to google what you've got really.",linux_gaming

5 years later I still have that PC running Ubuntu.  There are some valid criticisms to make of Canonical, but it's been rock solid set-it-and-forget-it for me.  The biggest disadvantage of Ubuntu is that they're slow to add new kernel versions, but as you're running old hardware, this will be less of an issue for you.

As I said - they're free to try, so don't get too hung up on needing to get the right one for you first try.  

Different people seem to have different experiences with individual distributions, but almost all modern Linux distros are *very* easy to install and get running well enough to test-drive them.  I was shocked how easy it was back in 2018 - I'd set aside a full weekend, expecting to have a steep learning curve to climb, but the reality was that I had Steam installed and was playing a game well under an hour after I started!  Most installers now are basically ""Click yes 3 or 4 times, pick your keyboard language, agree to install proprietary drivers for your Nvidia card, then wait a while for the installer to download everything""

Most will also offer the facility to run them from a USB stick so you can try before you install them on your actual hard drive (obviously they'll be a lot slower from a USB than fully installed on your SSD, but this is really just to check compatibility and whether you like the look and feel).",linux_gaming

I run Arch Linux and I built my PC about 3 weeks ago.  On Wednesday I tried to boot up and it just... wouldn't.

I probably didn't downgrade correctly and broke something.

But yeah, I was wondering if I'd have to completely wipe and reinstall for about half an hour before I found a neat trick to reinstall the Linux kernel only without touching my files.

It's hard to explain like ELI5, but the key part is these are NOT distros, some distros uses only one or have both supported. Gnome uses wayland, Xfce uses X11 and KDE uses both as examples.

The thing is X11 is getting slowly deprecreated and it's 30 years old in favour of wayland. Wayland has less input lag, less tearing, less resources and it's theoretically more secure BUT this security comes with the downside of almost all apps that ""simulates"" keystrokes or moving the mouse doesn't properly work (but KDE has a workaround).

ji2lu6m,"I'd wager this is a question better asked of the developers themselves.

Anyone who's releasing on [itch.io](https://itch.io) will probably have a good chance of answering you.

If I were to speculate, I'd consider how likely a Windows user would be to download the Linux version by mistake on each storefront.  

There are also games on Steam whose Linux version is abandoned and does not get updates anymore, yet the old versions remain around, so maybe removing support for a platform is harder on Steam?",linux_gaming
ji2m6ss,It's up to the developer/publisher where they want to put it. This has been a bone of contention for some Linux GOG customers for quite a while now. Sometimes the Linux version will get put up on GOG but then not updates so the Linux version falls behind. All you can do is reach out to the publisher and ask them to make the game available on stores other than steam. It is effort on their part to package it up and make it available so they may decide it's not worth their time.,linux_gaming
ji30g1l,Likely the existence of the steam runtime makes it easier to distribute linux builds on steam.,linux_gaming
ji3064t,"Very small (yet unpublished) game dev here.

We do plan on releasing on all the stores we can get, as far as I know all the deals with regular devs on exclusivity are made quite publicly because the whole point is to attract devs there, doesn't work if you made it a secret lol. Big dev companies are a whole other thing and I can't speak for them.

Mostly what we look is the market share + time developing it. Steam is the biggest one and iirc the easiest one to update the game with hot fixes. There is no point in developing to linux and breaking faith of the users if the product you sold breaks and you can't address it as quickly as possible.

If you fragment your patching process, for example, you have to see how you'll deal with all the other shops and hope for the best. You'll likely end up prioritizing steam anyway because most people are there, and it would be unfair to the others, or failing everyone on a bug-whack-a-mole that divides resources, for a small team that is already thinking of windows and console ports to stay afloat, a delay o that would be not great.

And that is before other things that might be niche problems, for example, Itch doesn't believe in DRM, neither do we, so no problems there, but others may not share the same opinion, and might not have the resources to develop their own.

I don't remember how GoG deals with most stuff (it has been a while since i looked into them), but what I do remember is my gf's experience with it as a linux player, and it wasn't fun. How much of the game's fault or the store was unclear, you could even argue that it was the user's, but that was not a problem we got elsewhere, and a developer won't win a blame-hot-potato in that situation.

We still want to publish there, but that just means more time considering when there are bills to pay and more money to be made elsewhere. Hopefully this will change over the years.",linux_gaming
ji2s1nk,Depends on developers. Some don't care to support more stores as well as Steam.,linux_gaming
ji4003y,"other then just plain developer negligence, steam provides a lot of stuff some games need to run, such as their networking and game input stack, could be they use those stacks on the linux build and thus releasing elsewhere is a problem.

Could be that they are also specifically targetting steamdeck support, and if thats so then releasing on gog doesn't really make too much sense.

And they might specifically be testing against the steam linux runtime, which provides a bunch of OS libraries so games don't need to support multiple distros, itch.io and gog games don't have that luxury.",linux_gaming
ji41xlh,"It's up to the developer, who may be operating under the impression that Steam is *the* go-to place to target their audience.

ji2w7g9,"You must understand Valve, unlike almost every other major publisher, is privately owned by the employees. They don't have shareholders to answer to like other companies. 

This gives them *a ton* of freedom to take risks other companies could never justify.  A hand-held Linux box?  No one would ever make that, but now that valve has shown there is a market, the cheap knockoffs are on their way. 

Valve was also the first ""app store"" I ever used back in 2004 to download Half Life 2.  Everyone else was still putting their games in boxes and shipping them to stores.   Soon after everyone else wanted to add their cheap knock-off game launchers too. 

Bottom line: what we get from Valve vs other publishers is the difference between a company beholden to their customers and fans vs a company beholden to their wealthy shareholders who just want more easy money for themselves.",linux_gaming

ji5ctix,">understand changing existing code to support Linux, but starting a new game? That shouldn't be too hard.

Depends.

On our end, the only real trouble we're getting with linux is the steam deck, because we don't have one on our hands. Appimage works wonders for the game, and so far all the problems we had with a raspberry pi are all a matter of automating some installation.

But many big projects might have a bottleneck on more complex graphics if they didn't consider linux at first. But indeed, that is decreasing less and less. Valve wanted to change the landscape of PC gaming and they certainly did that.

Not just for developers, but for the marketshare. Linux and Windows might as well be considered as different as PS5 and the Switch, but they made their platform known to buy once, run everywhere cover that. It is insane.

Valve would have a hard time saying ""this is the steam deck, it is great, buy again"", but they didn't. And people in this thread still insist there is some conspiracy of the small-medium game devs I wasn't invited to.

In order to actually get those calls to the hardware, it needs to go through the kernelspace driver. These include `radeon`, `amdgpu`, and I forgot the names of the Intel and Nvidia ones but they're the same deal: the driver itself is open source, but requires firmware to actually use.

This is not a shortcoming of the drivers, but rather the hardware. The GPU will not start up properly unless that firmware is provided. Since that firmware is cryptographically signed, it is *impossible* to produce open source firmware either, unless you somehow obtained AMD's firmware signing key (or compromised the GPU).

The exception is using the GPU as a simple framebuffer output. BIOS and UEFI both provide framebuffer interfaces which can be used without loading the GPU firmware, as they're typically used during early boot before the firmware can be loaded. These of course don't support any kind of fancy hardware acceleration features, though; they are simple, slow framebuffers, intended only for early boot.

This is the case for all AMD, Nvidia, and Intel graphics cards (as well as various other devices, like Intel wireless, and many other wireless cards. CPU microcode works in much the same way, but it's stored internally by the CPU and so doesn't require loading from the OS every boot).",linux_gaming

I don't think people use weird drivers very often. Many do use Wayland though which, in some cases, has weird performance on Nvidia cards even with latest drivers, where AMD are fine in my experience.

Another ""issue"" would be cases where you need [KMS configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Kernel_module_parameters) and rebuilding mkinitcpio every time your nvidia drivers or kernel itself gets updated (which is quite often in Arch). I remember needing that to get my laptop to be less stuttery and I had to use the \`nvidia-dkms\` package to help automate that. It worked in the end but update time skyrocketed due to all the extra builds that had to happen.    


In general Nvidia works just fine, especially if you don't care about wayland it should be safe. If you like rolling releases and tinkering with your system though, there a decent chance you will at some point have a bump due to the nature of the drivers.

If you prefer LTS releases, NVIDIA's proprietary drivers are going to be a more straightforward solution.

As for Wayland, at this point in time it's literally in a state of perpetual beta with varying issues under both KDE and Gnome.

As you are new to Linux I wanted to make a comment about your original post:

>Gaming on Linux is actually good, but patience is needed

Yes, it's normal to need patience for gaming on Linux. Windows has been on the market since long before and from the beginning it had a large number of users and a company to grow, be improved, polished. Linux, on the other hand, although it is widely used in servers, never got attention in the market of desktop computers, therefore, it took a while to have be user-friendly, polished and have tools that replace most of what you find in Windows. Worst, due to the small number of users the number of native games has always been quite reduced and when I started in 2011 even native games/emulators ran slower than Windows just due to lack of polish in the graphics drivers. In gaming all what you see now is thanks to projects like Wine (started almost 30 years ago and which makes possible to run Windows programs and games on Linux) and Proton (based on Wine, started by Valve/Steam when they noticed that Microsoft was trying to close Windows to installs of programs and games from outside the Windows/Microsoft Store (read [here](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/tim-sweeney-to-microsoft-universal-windows-platform-can-should-must-and-will-die/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/121wp7r/comment/jdp0ypl/)), and which optimizes Wine for gaming).

There is still a lot to improve for the experience to be as good or better than Windows, but being what it is today is already a great achievement and one that many said would never happen.

So keep that in mind the day Windows 10 ends its life cycle and you're caught between being forced to buy a new computer to use a system how Microsoft wants it to be or migrating to a system that lets you use the computer you want and that's how you want it to be.",linux_gaming

>...and Proton (based on Wine, started by Valve/Steam when they noticed

games from outside the Windows/Microsoft Store...

I didn't know that MS tried to do this. They are trying so hard to implement MS Store. By doing this, I think they're digging their own graves. No company should be allowed to impose what the user can or can't install on their OWN computer. ""Oh, but you are using a proprietary OS developed by a company, so you need to play by their rules"". The term PC, as far as I know, is for Personal Computer, not Proprietary Computer. Should I be limited to customize/install programs by what the company offers me? Of course not! This really grind my gears, even though I'm here using a company OS.   


When I switched from Win 7 to 10, I was kinda bothered with the new features, like Cortana, MS Store, pre-installed apps (which I hate so much, I'm looking at you Candy Crush, Microsoft Solitaire, TikTok, etc), all that bs telemetry, the need to create a MS account upon installation (can be bypassed, thank god), but I learned how to disable a lot of things with Regedit.",linux_gaming

ji7d53u,">I must say, I distro-hopped in Virutal Machine sometimes, tried Ubuntu, PopOS, Mint Cinnamon/XFCE and Kubuntu, so I limited myself with two options, Pop and Mint.

I did something similar, started on Ubuntu, also tried Linux Mint, but these are all Debian derivatives. As I got more experienced (Debian can be less user-friendly especially in those days) I decided to go straight for Debian, since, unlike Ubuntu which is maintained by a company, Debian is maintained by a team, it's a consolidated project and has more years of existence than me of life, so here I am.

And to explain, I have nothing against a system (proprietary or not) developed by a company, but I am the one who decides what my system can and cannot do, and that was missing from Windows and Ubuntu.

Side note: I've never used Pop!_OS, but it too is derived from Debian. In this case, the tree is as follows: Linux Mint and Pop!_OS are both projects derived from Ubuntu, which is derived from Debian. Kubuntu is just a variant of Ubuntu, so it doesn't count.

>I didn't know that MS tried to do this. They are trying so hard to implement MS Store. By doing this, I think they're digging their own graves. No company should be allowed to impose what the user can or can't install on their OWN computer.

They started trying to do this around Windows 8/8.1 but it also continued in Windows 10, you can look in Settings>Applications which even has an option, disabled by default, to install Apps only coming from the Microsoft Store. That's why Valve started efforts to support Linux, Steam is a Store for games, if the Microsoft Store was successful, Steam and others (Epic Games Store, Origin Games) would probably start to die and Microsoft could prevent installations outside the Microsoft Store at any time.

And I don't think Microsoft is digging its own grave because of the Microsoft Store. They can do this because when you install the system you are legally accepting the Terms of Use, with all the limitations that this imposes. You can look at the mobile market as an example: Apple develops iOS to their iPhone witch prevent you from installing anything from outside the App Store. You will even void your warranty if you try. The difference, in this case, is that on mobile market you have other options, Android is maintained by Google (and based on Linux) and there are tons of manufactures that use it on their own devices. Even if Google tries restrict Android (which it's been doing slowly for the past few years), you can choose devices that aren't locked down, and ultimately some manufacture can even create a derivative project if Google does some overkill.

None of that is true in the desktop market because Windows is a monopoly, Microsoft takes the system wherever it wants, does whatever it wants with the system and users, because, until a few years ago, what was the alternative if you wanted to use it to gaming for example? Or to work with Office (Microsoft Office is the most used in the world and remains restricted to Windows)? Or to work with editing programs like Photoshop? That's why monopoly practices are harmful even if the users themselves don't realize it. It's also why acquisitions like Activision by Microsoft are facing resistance from regulators.

I can't predict the future, but if Steam Deck is successful and has a long lifecycle, with more versions coming after it, maybe this scenario will change, and Windows having a competitor in the pc gaming market will be good for players themselves.

Linux Desktop in general IMO has a problem of information sharing between userspace & kernel space. Lots of occasions I've seen where compared to Windows, the kernel-space components just can't differentiate through different workloads and treat them differently ( yes, give VRAM to KWIN, also, give VRAM to game.bin. Yes, you can push that Chromium on the 3rd workspace render target to RAM for now, no matter what, try to keep game.bin in VRAM as much as you can). Or the usual: We're running out of RAM? I'd have preferred if you killed ""game.bin"" rather than Firefox & Libre Office apps. 

It gets better and there are cases where it's complex like how you mention it needs un-implemented Vulkan extensions and then some work on the translation layers. I hope it gets better: it has the potential to since we do have DX11/12 drivers (essentially what you can consider DXVK/VKD3D at this point) that can alleviate some bugs on the initial implementation.

Testing and other Arch users was there for grub, so I didn't have to deal with any of that nonsense on my Manjaro install (whereas my Garuda which updates from Arch repo had to). Broken glibc only lasted for a week, as they delayed pushing the broken one to stable and then pushed the hotfix ASAP.

You should probably name them, since most Redditors on Linux subreddits are quite negative about Manjaro (bit of a joke) :)

Bedside's that, basically all the major Linux distro's out there match your list of requirements. Even though you prefer rolling releases.

So a few options might be:
- openSUSE Tumbleweed
- Endeavor OS
- Void Linux

And even though you prefer rolling releases, I would still throw Fedora out there as an option. It needs some setup out of the box. But it's up-to-date, and stable enough for most.

Lastly, since you're on Nvidia, you'll need their proprietary drivers if you plan on playing any game even remotely successfully. So FOSS is kinda out the window in that case (at least in my experience).",linux_gaming

ji46fhn,Stay away from Manjaro - https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/,linux_gaming
ji5nzeb,"I would maybe look into [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) and see if you think it would suit you. From what I understand (having not run it myself, though I intend to try and likely switch to it in the future), Void is a very customisable rolling release distro with a focus on stability, which is what separates it most from unstable rolling release distros like Arch, which you may also be interested in and worth reading up on.

It's a smaller independent distro targeting power users, and since you like tinkering and want to be in control of your OS, it may appeal to you that e.g installation is more complex and manual than most distros, which allows you to pick and choose, configure, and install different parts of the OS like the DE, sound manager, etc yourself, with it all being well-documented. It's distinct from most distros since it's not derivative of another one like how most tend to all be either forks or forks of forks (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch-based).

Main downside is that since it's a smaller distro, the package manager may not always have everything you'd ever want like a big distro like Arch would, since it's just impossible to compete in that way, but you don't sound like someone who would mind having to build software yourself every now and then if need be.

Btw, definitely take a look at the ArchWiki and remember it for the future. It's useful on any distro, amazing resource if you are the type to tweak and configure a lot yourself.

Given your views on Microsoft, Apple, FOSS, etc, and that you clearly care for the philosophy behind software and who is behind it, I also recommend reading a bit into Manjaro if you're currently considering it—I don't mean to compare them to companies as evil as M$ or Apple, as I don't have strong views on Manjaro myself (beyond that its team sounds slightly incompetent)—but it's probably worth reading a bit into for you.

The only way Linux gaming explodes is ALOT more users. That's not really going to happen until Valve releases SteamOS publicly and partners with OEMs.

Also, you'll still be using Steam on it and I can almost guarantee it'll run better on the Deck as it's designed to run there.

Linux gaming is here to stay and the market share will continue to steadily increase as public perception of devices like the Deck continues to get more positive.

Right now the Steam Deck has no real competing products in its price bracket, and I don't see that changing unless Microsoft enters the market themselves or starts paying producers to put their Windows handheld UI plus Microsoft store on their products. I find the latter unlikely, as most people will use the Steam store on their Windows handhelds as well, making it hard for Microsoft to make up for the losses.

jhw45y8,"I don't really worry about this

\- If anything, this is great for Steam Deck. Developers don't have to do anything, Proton does most of the work for you. They can do optimizations of course like making text readable, scaling better to low-end systems and controller support. If they do those for Windows handhelds, that benefits Steam Deck as well. The Deck would be a massive failure if it needed specific 'Deck ports' of games to work. You can already see right now that a PS5 game like Returnal struggles on the Deck, while Xbox games never have that issue. An Xbox game cannot be too heavy for the Deck, since they all have a Series S profile. Some games work perfectly on the Deck, because they were originally made for the Switch.

\- Windows is already 98% of PC gaming today, a few million Windows handhelds won't change that.  

\- I don't see any of these devices compete seriously with the Deck. Laptops and desktops are multifunctional. Handhelds are dedicated gaming devices first and Windows simply doesn't play well with those. They have a historical advantage in terms of game compatibility, but that's sliding rapidly with every Proton update. And without real help from Microsoft, you simply cannot provide a good software experience the way Valve can. And Microsoft seems more interested in an Xbox handheld. Software has always been the major selling point for any hardware device. Steam remains dominant. Most PC gamers have their games on Steam. A windows handheld will never integrate properly with Steam the way the Deck can.

\- On top of that, without your own game store, you'll never hit the Deck's price point, so you'll remain a niche product.",linux_gaming

jhxq6dy,"Steam Deck is a successful device but does not have enough sales to shift the market by itself. Plus, it was never available on major stores, only on Steam web page in select countries. So I believe, studios which took Linux gaming seriously have done it by looking at the company behind Steam Deck, not the sale numbers. 

They wanted a good sample and they had two: 1) The market needed a good handheld device which allowed users to play their PC games and 2) the gamers have well responded to a Linux based device.

Steam Deck's hardware wasn't strong even the day it was released. So, it was a testbench. 

Additionally, I don't think every studio out there like to be limited by the platforms. When you make a game you want to sell it to as many players as possible to maximise the profit. In this case, Microsoft is posing a threat to everyone by holding the PC platform as hostage. Steam proved otherwise. Steam let gamers prove otherwise:) 

So, what happens if a successful Windows handheld device is released? Valve can release Steam Deck 2 or Steam Deck Pro, anytime. Or maybe a price cut. Or, even better, maybe they release it as a regular electronics product on other stores. I personally would like to see Steam Deck on Mediamark or Saturn shelves, which are very common at where I live.

That kind of thing is absolutely not Microsoft's forte.

The price for the hardware, Asus being the maker and the feeling Microsoft may have a hand in the Ally makes me think it will definitely affect Linux. Linux market share is the most significant way to push the platform forward and so the less Deck sells the slower rate it will grow.

That said there are some upsides:

* WINE and DXVK are incredible. WINE is great for older games while DXVK improves their performance, over Windows, in a good amount of cases. 
* Deck has had a good headstart; Microsoft often makes sure that their implementations of new tech is used first by the industry and it's not without reason (e.g CDPR's workflow is centered around D3D12)
* Ally has 120 display, the APU isn't custom and battery hasn't been disclosed. That could suck up battery really quick
* Valve is committed, next Deck will come before next Ally and it'll be even better
* With Valve's improvements to SteamOS Ally buyers could decide to install it for the many benefits it has over Windows 11. I mentioned one with first thing in this list.

Edit:

Other possible benefits of Ally:

* Promotes PC, Windows is not a closed ecosystem, it's free to a good degree. 
* Delays or combats threats to a free gaming platform: mobile and streaming is still a threat to a better gaming platform. I'm not going after people who play games on mobile, don't misunderstand, but mobile is one if not most cancerous gaming platform out there. Preys on every kid having a mobile phone in house and uses psychology and other tricks to condition them into thinking 10$ for a skin is good.

What Asus and many Deck competitors are doing in my opinion is making the exact mistake that has kept handheld PCs a niche item to begin with, instead of a household concept like a video game console. They're forgetting that at some point you'll have to use *a joystick* to control a *mouse cursor*, which is always gonna suck.

Consumers understand trackpads. They've been on laptops for decades. The technology is now suitably tiny that the actual pad itself can often take up more space than the circuitry driving it. Furthermore this control parity with laptops is enhanced by the control parity with consoles and the work Valve has done to build their control configurator into a legitimate product worthy of mention by itself. Which competitors could take advantage of, if they at the very least kept parity with the Deck.

This isn't even me touching that in my opinion many of these devices resemble quick cash grab entries into the market. What is the actual design decision behind not having a way to control the mouse beside touchscreen? I bet there isn't one, they just wanted to make a PSP form factor device that runs Windows.

The optical finger navigation for mouse on the Win4 would be great on something like the ROG Ally, but where is it? *Why did they choose nothing*?

>I doubt that ""random"" open source devs can evolve the project

There are a few things wrong with this. First, don't forget that Proton is a fork of WINE, which has had a long history of solid open-soirce development before Valve bothered with Linux. Of course, Valve's involvement has accelerated development tremendously, but let's not forget our roots. Second, a large number of tools that make Linux gaming possible, such as DXVK, are already developed by ""random"" open source developers.

>I think currently EAC and BattlEye...

Yes, that's correct. And some games have enabled support. I don't personally care for most games that make use of these, and luckily the only one I do care about (Elden Ring) works. But it has been 1-2 years since EAC and BattlEye have supported Proton, and the number of devs that enabled it is small. Destiny 2, R6 Siege, PUBG and Fortnite are games with massive player counts that pretty much refuse to enable it. Tarkov has been ""working on it"" for years.

Well yes and no. 

Tell me one hardware vendor which creates actually good Linux devices. As much as I appreciate the effort of companies like System76, their laptops are simply not good enough IMO. 

So most Linux users end up buying Windows hardware and installing Linux on it, essentially giving those hardware vendors the money despite them not supporting Linux at all.

You can see more details in my thread above with another person who also wanted to help. And I do appreciate that people here are helpful with this stuff.

But basically, my gripes are that every game (in Steam) required additional setup and troubleshooting beyond just clicking install and clicking play. It was never as simple as just install and play for me. And it is that simple on Windows.

In addition, I couldn't find a way to permanently configure the OS to use the full power of my GPU and CPU. It was always trying to run them at an energy efficient capacity instead of maximum performance. I found some applets that let me configure them, but they wouldn't permanently save my configuration, so I have to mess with them every time I restarted in Linux. This is another thing I didn't deal with in Windows.

Additionally, when I did get games working, something would happen causing them not to work again. When it happened with everything I had working, that was when I gave up, because I was just frustrated then.

I agree with you that the performance of the games is great. As long as I remember to configure my GPU and CPU after starting up the computer, I never noticed a difference in performance between Linux and Windows. When the games work, they work great.

I also like a lot of the other points you listed - customizing the OS, choosing which updates to install, etc. And yeah, finding ways around the forced MS account is annoying as hell, I will grant you that. It's an annoyance I deal with because it's less of a config issue for me than dealing with the other config issues I have on Linux, but having to work around that is a big strike against Windows.

I don't hate Linux. But what I want is a gaming experience that feels console like, but with the wide array of configuration settings available on PC. Right now, PC is, 99% of the time, install and play. Linux is, 99% of the time, install, tinker for 10 minutes to an hour, then play. Then have other random things get in the way of gaming at some later point too. It does, in fact, feel like gaming on Windows 95 to me. Except with modern games.

Public or not, Microsoft has 100% been positioning themselves in a place where they can afford to simply drop support for other platforms.  And they attempted to do so once before, so they clearly have the desire.  The threat is real enough to make supporting Linux a reasonable step.

As for launcher support, rumors are rumors, but don't discount the steamdeck just yet.  Valve has built quite the platform for others, software wise, and we \*know\* they'll keep adding to it.

Sure, an exception every few years or so. Meanwhile on modern Windows programs that were compiled 20 years ago still work just fine. The reason for that being Windows API, which serves as an abstraction between the underlying system services and user programs.

On Windows programs don't directly talk to the compositor to draw windows like they do on Linux, they use the Windows API. This lets Microsoft upgrade the subsystems without breaking the programs. For example, between XP and Vista they went through their own ""X11 to Wayland"" transition, by reworking the window manager into DWM. And as you may have noticed, pre-Vista programs run just fine on modern Windows, without the need for any XWayland-like emulation.

Freedom does not forbid Linux from having something like the Windows API. It's just that nobody has actually bothered to develop one. [Unless you count the Wine project, of course](https://sporks.space/2022/02/27/win32-is-the-stable-linux-userland-abi-and-the-consequences/).",linux_gaming

Going to protondb, finding the right review and copying the commands, it's all extra config I didn't have to do on Windows. And it took far longer than 30 seconds for a Linux newbie like me, because they didn't always work, so I'd have to look for more. 

And that single command is still something I couldn't find and get to stick. Why do I even need that? Why isn't there just a GUI option I can click on and make permanent? I still don't know how I would get that command to run and work if I still had my Linux install.

And that Port Proton thing is cool. If I need it next time I try Linux gaming, I'll come back to this comment to give it a try. But again, why isn't there a gaming distro that comes with that pre-installed?

All of these steps are, quite literally, *extra things I have to do on Linux that I don't have to do on Windows.* It's exactly what I'm saying I want to not have to do in order to switch to gaming on Linux. The one time OS setup stuff is less an issue - if I can do it once and never have to do it again, we can call that OS configuration. 

But I still want to be able to Google it and do the setup in a reasonable amount of time, with simple instructions, and preferably through a GUI. If it must be through a command line, then I'm looking for exact commands, not something I have to figure out what it all means on my own. And if the commands require dependencies to be installed first, I need to know whatever those are ahead of time.

But even with one time OS setup, that still leaves the idea I need to go to protondb to troubleshoot a fresh install to get it working. I do not want that as a typical step to setting up a game. I don't have to do that on Windows, I don't want to have to do that on Linux. That is the whole point. It may take 30 seconds for you, but it takes far longer than that for me, because it never seems to work when I try to follow the steps. I suspect because there are implied steps that someone with some Linux experience knows to do that a Linux newbie does not know to do on many of those sets of instructions.

If you want to experiment with the games yourself, the games I remember trying out were Final Fantasy XIV, Devil May Cry 5, and 20XX. That said, I did get all of them working at one point. And then they stopped working, and I couldn't figure out why, and that was about the time I gave up and nuked my install.

Hopefully the info you posted will help others who might have had similar issues to me. Maybe it will help me in a few years when I give it another go too. We'll have to see then. 

But really, what I'm looking for is not needing to do that, and instead being able to configure anything I need to through a GUI, which saves my settings permanently until I change them again myself.

I do not have to look up how to do this. The settings are all in game.

On Linux, I still have to configure graphics, in addition to the extra stuff on ProtonDB - which requires tinkering with the game outside of the game, rather than in the game. It sometimes requires tinkering with the OS as well. This outside the game configuration is extra work that I do not have to do in Windows in most games, unless I'm running a game I don't meet the minimum requirements for (this is rare).

And the problem is, while you seem to think this outside the game setup is simple, I have found, *for me, in my experience, it is not simple*. I have spent hours trying to get games to work that say they are supposed to work. And yes, that includes trying instructions from ProtonDB that failed to work. So this isn't me griping about five minutes of work, though again, even if it were only five minutes, it's still five minutes I don't have to take on Windows.

I don't really know how to make this any more clear. To switch to Linux, I want it to literally be exactly as simple as it is on Windows, or simpler. If there is any more complexity to get most games running on Linux, any extra steps I have to take, Linux just isn't ready in my eyes. For me, personally. It may be for you. It seems clear that is for you, and for many others. And that's cool. If it works for you and others, you should do that.

I will keep those other versions of Linux in mind with port proton setup for the future. Those may be a good fit for me to try. This is the first time I've heard of them or that they may make the experience simpler. Thank you for those, on my next go around I'll see what I can do with them.

And in case it isn't clear, I do want Linux to get there. I would like to ditch Windows for Linux. I'm also interested in the technology and the open source community.

jhycqa6,"Given I just went through the entire process of getting a new app running on Windows, I'm pretty sure I have a grasp on what it entails.  The message \*does\* say that, but if it's unsigned, you have to go through several steps to get it to allow you to run it anyways.  If it's signed, but not by a Microsoft approved certificate, then it says the usually ""this might be a virus"" message unless the app has been individually run through Microsoft's systems. (and that's for each update).  If it's signed by a Microsoft approved certificate, then it never displays the message.

~~On Windows 11, you also have to change a system setting to run unsigned apps.~~  It's well within their ability to start locking that down.  And they have convinced people that it's in their best interest to only trust Microsoft, so it's really only a matter of time.

Edit: And by ""get a new app running"", I mean I was the sole developer of said app, and went through the entire signing process.  Due to my userbase, I stopped short of paying the $200 fee for the approved ceritficate, but that's how I know Window 11 is making things more difficult, as you \*do\* have to manually approve each launch on *some* versions of Windows 11.

Asus want to upsell they do it on all of their ROG products. There's a reason they have three product lines for their gear, meh, TUF and ROG.

When I say Signed, I mean Signed *at all*.  The SmartScreen mentioned ""unsigned"" in reference to not being signed *by a Microsoft certificate*.  

When signing a program, you need a certificate.  That certificate can either be one you make yourself (self-signed), or be made by Microsoft (a ""Trusted Certificate"").  The former results in the SmartScreen appearing for the first thousand or so unique users.  The latter removes the SmartScreen all together.  If a program is completely unsigned, microsoft doesn't allow you to run it at all.  On Windows10, you can make a registry change to bypass either version of ""unsigned"", but on 11, the app must at least be self-signed.  If it's selfsigned, Windows will still call it ""unsigned"", as *microsoft themselves* haven't been part of the signing chain.  There's also 2 versions of the certificate you can get, A $200 version that makes the thousand install requirement a global requirement across all apps you sign, and a much more expensive one (which they don't tell you the price of), that completely removes the SmartScreen window.

Also the higher end devices at least initially are the ones that sold the most. As the deck gets older that will flip after early adopters/needs stop purchasing.

Again no company acknowledges rumours and speculation. This is just part of the press round. I'd like a Porsche for Ford focus pricing doesn't mean it's happening. Product segmentation and differentiation/upsell is standard in this space. Every bit of mood music is that the top end SKU has expensive components and is a premium device. If Microsoft was making it maybe I'd see the pricing rumours. But given the decrease in process node and the increase in cost there, global financial problems, issues with manufacturing, shipping you name it pricing has only been going up for high end goods.

These are the changes since the 8.0 rebase:

Now playable: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Minecraft Legends, Company of Heroes: Battle of Crete, STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN.  
Fixed Proton 8.0 regressions:  
Baldur's Gate 3 no longer launches to a black screen in Vulkan mode.  
Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition no longer crash on resolution change.  
Path of Exile no longer crashes.  
GTA V no longer freezes after each key press.  
Fixed Proton Experimental regression causing Payday 2 to crash on start.  
Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be a bit finicky.  
Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.  
Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.  
Fixed Madballs in Babo: Invasion claiming the game wasn't purchased.  
Fixed PlanetSide 2 launcher.",linux_gaming

ji2iawl,"what filesystem is in use on  the drive? exactly how did you mount it?

------

Notes I made for people trying to use steam under Linux and keeping game files on a NTFS  partition.  Notes  on ext4 filesystem at the end.

Also I Found this Guide - which may  be better or have some details I overlook. 

https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Using-a-NTFS-disk-with-Linux-and-Windows

Flatpak Warning 

- If your steam install is done using Flatpak  that can result in the steam program being sandboxed and limited in what it can access. I have no experience with how this limits things, the **flatseal** tool may be needed to manage the flatpak steam program.  You can setup the specific flatpak to have access to other filesystems and mountpoints outside of your home. 

the command `flatpak list`

  should show if you have steam installed via flatpak or not.

Flatpak notes at the end..

----

I have NO idea how the steam SNAP version differs in how it can access other locations either.   

----

Continueing with the normal guide now..  

------

Steam Game Directory on NTFS (fat32/exfat/vfat)

1. **don't use the file manager to mount the filesystem**
2. setup a  `/etc/fstab`   line to mount it at boot time
3. you do NOT (typically) use chown or chmod on  a mounted NTFS. (you do use those commands  with ext4)


example fstab entry.

------

            UUID=1234-your-uuid-56789 /media/gamedisk ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,user,exec,nofail,umask=000 0 0 

**You Do NOT use  all of  those options for ext4**  

------

On Ubuntu you can use 'ntfs' instead of ntfs-3g  for the filesystem in the fstab options if you have ntfs-3g installed , it auto changes  NTFS to be ntfs-3g. Other distribution may differ.  When ntfs3 gets more commonplace, and stable likely people will switch to using ntfs3, and drop ntfs-3g

Newer Distribution and kernels may use the `ntfs3` driver, I have not tested that driver.  Try it out and see if it works. 

The various issues and problems with ntfs getting mounted Read Only still apply.  (hit up the numerous NTFS  under Linux guides for more information)  These issues also apply to exfat,vfat, fat32, and I imagine using ntfs3.  Disable windows hibernate/suspend and fast boot if sharing a filesystem between linux and windows.


And ..

it's best to not use ntfs for your game storage drive , it can be  slower and more of a CPU load.  It does Work for me, but it is slower in my experience.

also.. there are a lot of bad/wrong/old  posts/blogs/guides  on this topic. so watch out for those.  (some of the info here may be wrong, so dont trust this guide 100%)

 This guide may be outdated or wrong when we start using ntfs3.



Also be sure to check out this guide, and the part about the compatdata directory 



https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Using-a-NTFS-disk-with-Linux-and-Windows#preventing-ntfs-read-errors


--------

bonus tip.   **Steam scale ui Tweak.:**

set a system variable to have steam scale up it's UI.

             $    GDK_SCALE=2  steam

edit your steam .desktop file to make it the default option, or make a second .desktop file for a steam 2x Launcher.


--------

STEAM on an ext4 or other Linux filesystem.

basic outline..

format the Filesystem, get the UUID
make directory for the mount  

           mkdir /home/bob/games 
 
make fstab entry. 

      UUID=123-YOUR-UUID /home/bob/games ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0

mount the filesystem  

          sudo mount /home/bob/games 


make the Filesystem owned by your user.  

         sudo chown bob.bob /home/bob/games 


reboot to make sure it mounts.

use steam and tell it to put a steam library on /home/bob/games
install games as normal.

------------------

**ntfs3 notes**

from user mandiblesarecute who gives an example with ntfs3

      PARTLABEL=Win10     /media/win10    ntfs3   noacsrules,noatime,nofail,prealloc,sparse                                       0 0

 noacsrules **makes everything effectively 777** for when you don't need or care about fine grained access control. 
 
This 777 mode can be annoying and a security issue  in some use cases which is why it's not the default.

I had issues using  `Ntfs3`, so  for now I still use `Ntfs-3g `, i will test out ntfs3 again in the future as it matures. 


------

**Steam flatpak notes from another user. TimRambo1**

For flatpaks  you want to  use the **flatseal** tool to allow access to the filesystem mountpoint of your steam games filesystem.

example: add  mount point 
**/home/(username)/games/**

 under **filesystem** under the steam settings in **flatseal**. 

The filesystem still has to be properly mounted (as shown above)

I keep a separate drive with Windows installed solely for a couple of games that won't work well under Linux and even I wouldn't use AtlasOS for that after realizing just how non-secure it is in its current form.

In computing something has to stop being support and not be functional to be obsolete.

The contention from Sony and friends, and latterly the UK CMA, is that Microsoft will take the biggest titles in the industry and lock them away into their own platforms, XBox and Windows.

The first play is that they won't make any of the big titles XBox exclusive - something that they will add qualifiers like ""for a year"". They absolutely fully intend to eventually make new Call if Duty games XBox exclusive.

A defence is that they would also release the games to PC - an open platform. It is, however, Microsoft owned, and the CMA is actually taking that into account.

So if Microsoft needs to release to a neutral, open platform, doesn't want to give anything to their competitors and can't use Windows-only as an excuse then *maybe* a concession would be that they release to XBox + Linux.

I think that is the response -- there are no terms that'd make Sony happy.  And as much as I'm no fan of Sony, I don't blame them one bit -- coming up with terms with Microsoft is like making a deal with the devil.  I'm quite sure Microsoft would find terms that sound OK but have loopholes; or get  terms that are solid but get loopholes thrown in by the time they got a deal hammered out with antitrust lawyers; or appeal until they get the deal they want; or once they are merged just plain ignore the agreement and pay fines or whatever. They have after all done all of these in the past.

I think the worst is the antitrust agreements -- US one, they got ""Microsoft will be broken up"" reduced to ""you must open up API specs"" (they started bluffing about getting things like Samba pulled off the market despite it being fully clean room reverse engineered, so they could have something to give up as an antitrust settlement; and the judge fell for it hook line and sinker.)  And EU one where they were required to produce a version of Windows without IE bundled (which they did, at 0 price discount, and not really available to buy anywhere) along with a few other trivial concessions, which Microsoft did not even follow.

jhwh5z8,"Two main reasons: 

1) Sony enters into a funding agreement with publishers and developers to make games for their platform. Third party devs are still free to make games for other platforms, and timed exclusivity deals are on the table because Sony will still make that deal to boost the Playstation ecosystem. 

Insomniac could have made games for other platforms while still doing Spider-Man for Sony (who exclusively owns trademarks relating to the character's appearance in media). Sony bought Insomniac because of their close relationship, the history between the two companies, and because Insomniac wasn't interested in offering titles to Xbox for reasons relating to 2). 

Sony invests in developers like From Software, but they aren't interested in buying studios outright unless they address niches that Sony needs filled. Hello Games is one example of the former (funding agreements, remains independent), while Bungie is the latter (funding agreements, was independent, purchased to fill a niche). 

Nintendo, meanwhile, operates in a completely different market for handhelds. The Switch CAN be a home console, but the vast majority of owners take advantage of its portability. Besides, the vast majoriy of game sales on Nintendo's platforms are for first-party titles. 

2) Microsoft buys out entire publishers to control the distribution of games that their studios and indie clients end up making. That's a different ballgame. 

Their strategy under Satya Nadella's leadership is ""meet customers where they are"". Gamers increasingly want portable access to their libraries, and Microsoft has the whole cloud gaming stack down pat.

Microsoft bought eleven different studios in one year to boost Game Pass sales and offer better titles exclusively on Xbox Cloud Gaming. 

Microsoft bought Zenimax to boost Game Pass sales and offer better titles exclusively on Xbox Cloud Gaming (The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, RAGE, Wolfenstein, Prey, Dishonored, The Evil Within, QUAKE, etc.). 

Microsoft is attempting to buy ABK to boost Game Pass sales and offer better titles exclusively on Xbox Cloud Gaming (Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Diablo, Overwatch, Spyro, Starcraft, Tony Hawk's games, Warcraft, World of Warcraft, TMNT, SWAT, Heartstone).

It's not difficult to see the pattern forming. 

ALL (and I really do mean all) of those franchises will or would eventually turn into games that you access with a Microsoft account, and play with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.  

Sony saw big jumps in the number of people using Remote Play with PS4 and PS5 on phones and tablets, so they are investing in that space as well with PS Now. But they don't have the chops or finances to compete with a company that already operates one of the biggest cloud computing platforms on the planet.",linux_gaming

A US government agency is taking Microsoft to court. To stop the merger 

Should Microsoft  just tell the US government that they will just shutdown their US business and cease to sell and support all MS products in the US moving forward

It may not just be the US and UK who have issues with the merger

> When you publish on Steam you can't also publish it elsewhere cheaper
 
 I also don't know where you're getting games can't be sold cheaper elsewhere. Where in the steam TOS does it compell publishers to have the same price everywhere? 

> making it essentially pointless for customers to buy it outside of Steam. If you're not on Steam you essentially don't exist on PC so it's impossible for other stores to thrive.
 
What? Where are you getting this from. You absolutely can publish, purchase and play games without steam. That's what alternative storefronts are. For example any game that's on steam and gog, I always purchase from gog. Steams not involved in me buying and playing that game.

Other stores can thrive when they actually do the job of being a storefront and that means publishing and selling games while providing a smooth user experience. Steams only advantage here is they care about the UX and their users know it so they stay on it. All the other stores (except a few niche ones like gog) are just here to give the publishers a bigger cut of the pie so they bloody suck and no one uses them if they can help it.

I'd leave steam tomorrow if gog got a better catalogue. I'm not loyal to steam. I'm using the best product for what I want at the time.",linux_gaming
jhuzh35,"Also their business model was, to put lightly, absolute crap because it forced users to rebuild their libraries through their store instead of using their libraries from elsewhere. Coupled with the fact that you couldn't download the games to run it locally and it made it a very hard proposition to support.

I don't know exactly how Amazon Luna works, but I think NVidia had the most consumer-friendly idea, followed by Microsoft.

Big problem is that after Google's failure other companies are unlikely to do *anything* of what Google tried.

Not that there aren't a lot of companies that could even come close to pulling it off: 

* Meta is such a clown show that they're basically dropping their namesake and moving into AI so they're unlikely to invest in cloud gaming anytime soon.
* Apple could but it would probably be iPhone exclusive and only for iOS software.
* There's Valve and Epic but while I do think they have (or can acquire) the expertise I don't think they have the infrastructure to pull it off. Also Epic pretty much hates Linux.

Lutris 0.5.12 has moved to using dxvk v2.1 as a default, so if you have an older graphics card or drivers (nvidia 470 or Mesa 22.0) you will need to change this as high probability OW2 won't start. In these cases, use the protonup-qt referenced in the video to install dxvk-async-2.0 and add DXVK\_ASYNC=1 to the env variables.

[Battle.net](https://Battle.net) has an annoying habit of always wanting to update when it launches on a GE wine version (GE7-34 is the recommended GE version for OW2), this is not present if you use wine-8.6-staging-tkg (this is a manual install where you copy the tar file from kron4ek github site to the runners/wine folder and extract it). Either of these two runners are recommended, the GE is better for older hardware, the staging-tkg is excellent with newer hardware.

At this point it's kind of hard to tell how realistic any of his issues are, given how outspokenly negative he's been over time, often to the point of just coming across as trolling the Linux community.

There was a point when anti-cheat wasn't possible on Linux, so understandable that they didn't want to leave an entire OS unsecured against cheaters. The game also ran terribly on Linux, though a lot of that seemed down to them just being stuck on an old version of Unity, but it was at least somewhat understandable that they didn't want to put in the extra time for the sake of an OS with few players?

Now, I'm really not sure. EAC can run on Linux (natively or under Proton), though perhaps it's not quite the same (compared to the deep kernel-level anti-cheat that's possible on Windows). Plenty of games these days do support anti-cheat via Proton though, and there doesn't seem to be a huge issues with cheaters using Linux.

Explanation (since regexes are unreadable):

- `/` matches a slash
- `\(` marks the start of a capture group
- `[0-9]*` matches any number of digits (in this case, ""409720"")
- `\)` marks the end of a capture group
- `/` matches another slash
- `.*` again matches any number of any characters (in this case, whatever text remains after the app ID)

We then print capture group one (""\1""), which contains our app ID. You can improve this further if you know the starting components of the path, eg you could instead use:

`s:\$HOME/\.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/\([0-9]*\)/.*:\1:`

Yes sadly if your GPU does not support vulkan (older ones don't, all new ones do), then games will have to use WINED3D instead of DXVK, this will result in lower performance for sure.

I set up a script as outlined in that post containing the pp_dpm_mclk fix command, and then set the script to autostart rather than start with gamemode, with a short delay to prevent it from launching before CoreCtrl does.

So in /root/scripts I have memory_oc_fix.sh containing ``echo ""3"" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_mclk``

And then in my home folder in .scripts I have memory_oc_fix.sh containing this:

`#!/bin/sh`

`sleep 5 && sudo /root/scripts/memory_oc_fix.sh`

You can set the home script to autostart through most DEs, it's something that varies. Not a Gnome user so I can't say.

Do all this at your own risk, I'm not aware if having your system be unstable and flicker for 5 seconds after boot could cause any issues like sudden crashes.

jhylkxf,"Hi! Normally I would suggest using SteamTinkerLaunch to handle Vortex since it automates much of this process, but since you're using EGS through Heroic you'll have to do this manually. Thankfully, it's not that hard!

Basically you'll want to install the mod manager into the same prefix you're using for the game (whether that's shared between other games or not isn't important; just so long as it's the one used for Fallout). 
Vortex has a dependency on .NET 4.6, so use Winetricks to install that - Heroic has a Winetricks button in the game's settings panel, next to the play glyph, in Lutris it's under the wine glass dropdown when selecting a game. Then ""Select the default wineprefix"" -> ""Install a Windows DLL..."" -> tick `dotnet46` and click okay. It takes a while, but should go through just fine on a clean prefix. MO2 might be similar, but isn't what I use personally.
After this, you can just install it using its setup program (in Heroic, in the game's settings panel, use ""Run EXE on Prefix"" - on Lutris, in the Wine dropdown, use ""Run EXE inside Wine prefix"") and run it. Once it's run, you'll be prompted to install .NET 6, so let it do that and restart it. From there, you're pretty much good to go. For Vortex you might want to disable its hardware accelerated interface, but otherwise it should work just fine.

Pretty much most, *if not all(?)* mods work using this way on Linux. It would obviously be smoother though if you had the Steam releases since, again, STL handles most of the preamble work for you, but that's the gist of the manual setup process.

*MO2 would almost certainly require overwriting Fallout's executable path in Heroic to point to MO2's. If you use Vortex then booting the game normally should work fine to launch it modded.",linux_gaming

Even for AMD users I'd recommend using X11 first then try Wayland as its not perfect there either (is better then NVIDIA experience however).

Be aware Linux has a few missing/nonfunctional features you may have used under Windows such as HDR/AutoHDR and 10bit colour modes.

Additionally the NVIDIA-Settings tool is a bit wonky, it works but has a habit of resetting to default settings each time you load it (and will reset config files without asking).

It will be a learning curve and a bit of a wild ride.  I don't know which Distro would be best, ultimately it comes down to personal preference in the end, such as if you like how things are packaged, if you like the community support, how many problems each Distro may cause on first use.

Just keep in mind that many Distro's have lots flavors (Desktop Environment choices) but ultimately are the same thing.

For example Ubuntu and Kubuntu and Mint etc all run off same ecosystem, a desktop environment does not *really* separate their experiences, try em all, decide for yourself which DE is best for your purpose.

Then, the beta ended, and a couple months later the actual game got released. And it didn't work for a couple days, until someone made a wine-version that fixed the issue. The game worked great from that point on.

- X11 apps ""scale themselves"", which also has the side effect of things getting a bit weird with multiple monitors with different scaling
- X11 apps get scaled by the system, which won't do weird multi monitor stuff, but it causes apps to not render at the full resolution on monitors with a scale higher than 100%, making them a bit blurry",linux_gaming

I’m probably an idiot, but I actually did put it in an adapter, thinking along your lines. This led to a week of hell for me learning about legacy BIOS/ MBR GPT UEFI compatibility issues. I learned a lot, let’s say that 

Basically, as far as I can tell, the drive was configured for UEFI and incompatible with the MBR/ Legacy BIOS of the new mobo. I eventually wiped the drive and wrote it in a MBR/ msdos filesystem to he compatible

But the windows installer gave the disk controller issue even then. 

I actually got the windows installer to install windows though, despite the error, and now I have this new insane situation on my hands where it says the install is bad because of disk controller issues, but that somehow comes up even when I boot from my main disk, or even from an installer USB. It’s like a Windows ghost has installed itself somewhere in the firmware or something 

The error that appears is 0xc00000e and I can’t boot into my main Manjaro, though I don’t think the data on that drive has been wiped. I suspect windows has somehow mysteriously superficially usurped everything

But since the windows usurpation both lead to the windows error screen 

And yeah, what worries me is not only did I mess with the boot drive order/ selected boot disk at BIOS and I got the same windows error screen…

I selectively installed the various disks. The Manjaro drive gives the windows error screen when it’s the only disk physically connected. The targeted windows (PCIe/ SATA slot, both ways) gives the same thing. 

I can still boot into the MS installation media from USB but that’s it. My next step is to go get another jump drive and do a live linux and run the classics (lsblk, fdisk -l, etc) and see what’s going on with the rest of my drives. 

It is honestly super confusing. I have physically isolated the disks and while I haven’t done every single BIOS permutation (there is probably 45-150 of them total), none have even changed things. None of those steps made it make more sense

This used to be a meme everyone could laugh at, arch breaks every update was funny since it never happened but the quality of updates on arch makes me wonder if something will be so bugged it'll get in the way of my day to day usage.

Manjaro could be better because I think they hold packages for a little longer, and even tho they have a TON of issues I'd rather change the time than having to recompile ibus with a wip patch for me to be able to type properly, I don't know exactly how updates work on manjaro but if you can have a line of defense from the horrible updates arch gets then I think it could be usable.

With that said I think the best of both worlds would be just using ubuntu or sticking with pop os, mint is too outdated based on LTS and even when new LTS rolls around the mint team takes a little bit to release their update and arch is on the other extreme of being so new it can become an obstacle.

Their strategy is simple, test it testing branch and if bugs are found, withhold from stable branch until fixed. This was really nice for me since in the actual above example, kde 5.26 branch was a mess. They stuck with 5.25 LTS for quite a lot of time, until the 4th or 5th release of 5.26, but it meant that when update finally happened, it was smooth experience. Arch on the other hand was not as much of a smooth ride. So in a way, the delay is their to smoothen out the rough edges, and it works pretty well since I am almost always with the latest software but can't remember a broken update in a long time. 

Also the reason I have installed it for every friend and relative in last 3-4 years. Ubuntus gave a lot of trouble and I would always be troubled with phone calls and such. Manjaro has been much better recieved in comparison.

Distros that ship Steam and whatnot out of the box are kind of similar to those unofficial Windows ISOs with a bunch of preinstalled things and (supposed) optimizations. Both may claim to be out of the box gaming ready and all that, but it should be taken with a grain of salt.  

There's as many ""perfect"" configurations as there are people. You're not going to find a distro that's has everything you want out of the box. Just install what you want yourself. It's not that hard. Particularly on Linux, where pretty much any program is a click/command away from being installed. No hunting for exes online required.  

I, for example, use Arch (on which I installed Gnome and a ton of GUI tools, so even that is hardly ""terminal-centric"" anymore), which has next to everything in it's repos and what it doesn't have there is available from the AUR.

Many games actually perform worse with the native executable than if you just run the Windows exe through Proton. This is usually because the dev didn't take any time to optimize the Linux build, and just threw the linux executable in as a second thought. And there are tons of games with no linux executables that run perfectly well on Proton, you could never tell the difference.",linux_gaming
jhquayq,"So I went 9 years or so practically only buying linux native releases.  Maybe an odd windows title slipped into my library if I found a bundle with a majority of linux native games.

With Proton having gotten so good I buy indiscriminately nowadays, though I will usually favor a title with a native build.

I've been going through on my refreshed HTPC installing couch co-op friendly games that I own (a couple hundred) and I'm finding that sometimes I'm switching to the windows release w/ proton to get a better experience (usually because native is no longer launching or the controller is wonky).

Quite a few 'linux native' games were just hacked up ports with opengl translation layers and more than a few had old embedded versions of wine to make them run.  In those cases, even though I'm not sad that I did my part to support linux gaming by throwing money at a developer for at least making an effort, going forward the likely more-maintained windows version + proton is probably going to be the better choice.

That being said, there are some developers who have done great linux ports or who have continued updating their port over the years when issues arise.

Frictional Games were releasing linux clients of their games before steam for linux was a thing.  You can't go wrong with any of their titles.

Paradox also has traditionally done solid ports of their games.

Serious Sam 3 and the Talos Principle were both great linux ports.  Anything linux-supported Croteam did up until about 2018 should be a high quality port.

Though Feral's stuff was done with source-level opengl (and later vulkan) wrappers, I'm pretty sure they're all still working well and will probably be updated as long as Feral's around (which will hopefully be forever).  The same, to a lesser extent, with Aspyr titles.  I'm still seeing a few updates come out for their ports, but they seem to take a while.

Unity engine games have offered solid linux support for longer than most of the other big commercial engines and certainly have put more effort into it than say, Epic with the Unreal engine.  A lot of 'linux ports' of Unity games though are not very well playtested though so YMMV with them.

Oh, and an oldie but goodie, Battleblock Theater.  It's an example of an old port that's been updated a couple of times over the years due to showstopper launch bugs and is working better than ever right now.",linux_gaming

- **2013** - uses OpenGL. It's a compatibility nightmare, it relies on outdated system libraries: I had to add, among other things, old CentOS 6 or 7 libraries to make it run on a modern distro. **You're better off using the Windows version instead.** >!If you're up for a challenge, check out [the ArchWiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Steam/Game-specific_troubleshooting#Tomb_Raider_\(2013\)) for guidance.!< *Note: Saves aren't cross-compatible!*
- **ROTTR** - uses Vulkan. It has some missing features like DLSS, but it's no big deal, because its DLSS implementation looks hideous anyways. Other than that Linux version supports Playstation controller glyphs unlike the Windows version, but on the other hand Linux version has wacky stick sensitivity which ignores the sensitivity slider. **In general, it's a decent native experience.** *Note: Saves aren't cross-compatible!*
- **SOTTR** **(I don't own the Linux version)** I've heard the Linux port is pretty darn good, but in case you're interested in the Windows version - its DLSS is wayy better looking than ROTTRs (don't forget appropriate env vars to enable it! You need at least `PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1`). Also, it runs great through Proton GE, I definitely recommend using that over Wine GE, which has poor performance (I played it outside of Steam, but it's also available on Steam so I guess it's still a ""Steam game"" going by GE's definition?) So to summarize **Windows version runs really well,** especially when set to DX12/VKD3D (might require another env vars to unlock).

> Vampire Survivors has native .sh (...)

DDLC does that too.

> Terraria

If your monitor is above 60Hz the game will be very jittery, frame skip can't fix it. I managed to stabilize it with Mangohud's frame limit using `fps_limit_method=early` config option. Other than that **it works great.**

(tip: you can enable Vulkan backend using `/gldevice:Vulkan` option) 

> Valheim

The cursor is wacky in menus at 1440p, but dropping to 1152p (wtf?) fixes it (could be caused by XWayland? By fractional scaling? idk). Other than that, **it works great.**

11 animal classes (Yes, you can play as animals)

The depth is insane.  
The game uses real-life moon phases that the werewolves have to rely on.  
If you walk outdoors in real-life and see a full moon, you can log into the game and be at your strongest as a wolf.  
Careful though, being a werewolf in the game is a permanent choice that cannot be reversed like other curses.    

Every class has the ability to do damage so even the healers have capable damage abilities when playing solo.  
That said, the game does have a trinity system so tanks and healers have a part to play.  

If you get cursed and become a cow, it's advised that you also pick up cheesemaking since you can milk yourself.  
If you eat a vetetarian diet in-game for 2 weeks, your milk production will increase which can increase profits.  
Other players can ask to milk you too so with your permission, you could always assist other cheesemakers.  

Alongside cheese, there are over 840 consumable foods in the game.  
Eating foods keeps a player fit for battle.  
Combine food buffs with snack buffs and you become much more capable in battle.  

If your a male and get turned into a Deer, you become a Stag  
If you're a female and get turned into a Deer, you become a Fawn.  

1 character can switch between any class so all progress made on gathering and tradeskills never needs to be repeated if you don't want to make an alt.  
if you level up and decide that class isn't for you, you can start leveling a different class.  
The game uses a dual classing system so whatever 2 skills you have on your hotbar will determine what items drop for you.  
If you're inventory gets full, you can drop items in the game world for others to pick up.  

All mobs have the ability to drop legendary items, at any level. The rarity only determines the number of stat bonuses an item provides.  
When crafting, you can swap out these stat bonuses to benefit only the skills that you prefer to use.  

When you die to a boss, you get a permanent curse until you kill the boss.  
If you're not strong enough to remove the curse, you have to enlist help from others to help lift your curse.  
There are hundreds of different curses in the game and they can all stack.  

Just reading the number of skills on the wiki is enough to make ones head spin

And unity kind of sucks where the Linux export is concerned. 9 times out of ten, the windows version performs better using Proton than the native port, *and* the effort to maintain a separate Linux port and deal with all these extra headaches is, in most cases, too much for said small time devs.

If a developer puts in the effort to make their game run well on Proton, the results are often much better for a lot less effort, meaning the devs can put their time into improving their game or making a new one.

I consider this investment into a well functioning Proton port ""Linux support"" and will be more likely to buy and support the developer.

If your goal is to support Linux, you can go the purism way, but that will raise the barrier of entry for both developers and users.

ProtonDB suggests that changing the graphics settings back and forth (from epic to high and back to epic) solves this and in my experience this is true.

I'm not sure if the quality is that much better, but the only way to get AMF encoding working is by using the proprietary vulkan driver, yes.

First is to use AMF. On my RX580 is offer best performance and quality. But you need install amdgpu-pro (but to game you can still use mesa).

Second is to use mesa with vaapi but instead using default mode, use it via obs-gstreamer or via obs-vaapi plugin. Both offer vaapi with h264 and h265. In my testing I must say that 265 works much better, but if you want streaming to twitch you then you can't use 265...

There is my work e-mail posted on wiki, together with my Reddit username, and you could have at least tag me.

That said this issue was raised to me before, but due to time constraints I haven't had time to clean the wiki before, I just set the page creation permission to require registered user. This apparently did absolutely nothing.

To combat this in a more long-term way, that wouldn't need my attention too often, there are two possible ways from my quick research. A) using reCAPTCHA (via [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit) extension) B) requiring confirmed E-mail address to edit. I am currently inclined to using both cumulatively, but I am open to further discussion. The reason the wiki was as much open as possible was due to the nature of the Linux community and many of the users being very privacy centric. This approach is sadly not possible anymore, as we see. Using reCAPTCHA needs JavaScript enabled and can be a pain, especially for users with hardened users where it can't detect legitimacy other way than showing pictures. E-mail verification requires you to provide valid E-mail, and even tho I have no intention to use this maliciously and will serve the purpose just for verifying the user, I do understand that some users might not prefer this.

Both ways will require me to prepare some legal documents and do other modifications to the website to be compliant with GDPR, as I would be requiring your private information (E-mail address). With regard to reCAPTCHA (and correct me if I am wrong), that would on the other hand probably create cookies, so then the cookie consent would be required.

Both ways, it will take me some time to resolve this issue, and if anyone is interested in helping I am very open to collaboration.

Long story short, what you pointed as pros are what made me ignore Garuda

\- Heavily themed and not to my taste

\- Ton of added software

Different people have different need :)

The one advice I would give to an user looking to try a new distro is to look how active and friendly the community is. Having a base install close to your need is nice, but being able to ask questions and find help when something happens is really the ""killer feature"".

Sadly, it took exception to the Nvidia GPU in the laptop a couple of months ago and just refused to work, even with a clean install.  Shame.

I disagree with you that the OS is simple to use, its still arch, you're still accessing bleeding edge packages, there are going to be issues and if you're using KDE, good luck with all of those bloated widgets and wayland.

For someone starting, in my opinion a stock config when it comes to a DE would be better, especially when talking about KDE, which shits its pants with wayland every time. 

Dragonize theme looks good, but the animations and bunch of programs a first time user probs would never use is just a waste of system resources. There is either way not much of a difference when it comes to distros using semi new packages.

If anything I would recommend some to first find a DE that they like, which is the biggest factor in linux adaptation and then to choose a distro which has a lot of users and maybe is being pushed by a big company. Opensuse, Fedora, different flavors of ubuntu, or even endeavourOS since its closed to stock arch (even if its arch) are all good choices. There is also nobara, but since its just fedora with custom repos and pre applied tweaks but only maintained by a single guy, I wouldnt really recommend it to first time users, perhaps after they spend some times on more stable distros.

jhkt3aj,"I think that contributing to the Linux kernel helps them, and making Windows more Linux-like under the hood in order to make WSL better is also to their benefit: it reduces the number of benefits that Linux has.

It looks a lot like Microsoft wants Linux users on Windows and they try to bait them over with stuff like WSL, going as far as making desktop Linux apps work on Windows.

The flip side of the coin however is where the red flags live.

Microsoft has some ""reasons"" for MAUI not officially supporting Linux, and I don't think it has anything to do with letting the community do what they want with it. It seems like to me that it's another thing to have the Linux community go waste their time on while Microsoft finds more ways to screw over the Linux Desktop community.

It doesn't really stop there. Microsoft took over MonoDevelop and MonoDeveloper 8.x doesn't even compile on Linux because of private dependencies. It works on MacOS though... and there just happens to be an IDE called Visual Studio for Mac. I wonder where that came from. I also don't see who it is even supposed to be for, because I do not see a lot of people trying to target MacOS in .NET, I do however see that being the case for Linux because Linux is good for servers and Microsoft can't expand market share in the web runtime market if they don't get their stuff working on Linux servers.

Looks suspiciously like MacOS isn't a perceived threat for the Windows desktop, probably because Apple is basically anti-gamers, and the hardware is overpriced. Looks a lot like Linux on desktops *is* a threat though.

And no, I don't think Microsoft made Roblox tell us to fuck off, but I wouldn't blink if you told me that they helped, it wouldn't be a surprise.

The solution is to use Proton-GE from upstream, not the Flatpak packaged version, or use Valve's upstream Proton with shader cache enabled in Steam's settings. Enabling the shader cache is necessary because Valve uses the same cache to redistribute transcoded versions of games' videos, using a codec that they can use in Proton, so if you go that route it means you never use WMV, so you don't need it.

Flatpak Warning 

- If your steam install is done using Flatpak  that can result in the steam program being sandboxed and limited in what it can access. I have no experience with how this limits things, the **flatseal** tool may be needed to manage the flatpak steam program.  You can setup the specific flatpak to have access to other filesystems and mountpoints outside of your home. 

the command `flatpak list`

  should show if you have steam installed via flatpak or not.

Flatpak notes at the end..

----

I have NO idea how the steam SNAP version differs in how it can access other locations either.   

----

Continueing with the normal guide now..  

------

Steam Game Directory on NTFS (fat32/exfat/vfat)

1. **don't use the file manager to mount the filesystem**
2. setup a  `/etc/fstab`   line to mount it at boot time
3. you do NOT (typically) use chown or chmod on  a mounted NTFS. (you do use those commands  with ext4)


example fstab entry.

------

            UUID=1234-your-uuid-56789 /media/gamedisk ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,user,exec,nofail,umask=000 0 0 

**You Do NOT use  all of  those options for ext4**  

------

On Ubuntu you can use 'ntfs' instead of ntfs-3g  for the filesystem in the fstab options if you have ntfs-3g installed , it auto changes  NTFS to be ntfs-3g. Other distribution may differ.  When ntfs3 gets more commonplace, and stable likely people will switch to using ntfs3, and drop ntfs-3g

Newer Distribution and kernels may use the `ntfs3` driver, I have not tested that driver.  Try it out and see if it works. 

The various issues and problems with ntfs getting mounted Read Only still apply.  (hit up the numerous NTFS  under Linux guides for more information)  These issues also apply to exfat,vfat, fat32, and I imagine using ntfs3.  Disable windows hibernate/suspend and fast boot if sharing a filesystem between linux and windows.


And ..

it's best to not use ntfs for your game storage drive , it can be  slower and more of a CPU load.  It does Work for me, but it is slower in my experience.

also.. there are a lot of bad/wrong/old  posts/blogs/guides  on this topic. so watch out for those.  (some of the info here may be wrong, so dont trust this guide 100%)

 This guide may be outdated or wrong when we start using ntfs3.



Also be sure to check out this guide, and the part about the compatdata directory 



https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Using-a-NTFS-disk-with-Linux-and-Windows#preventing-ntfs-read-errors


--------

bonus tip.   **Steam scale ui Tweak.:**

set a system variable to have steam scale up it's UI.

             $    GDK_SCALE=2  steam

edit your steam .desktop file to make it the default option, or make a second .desktop file for a steam 2x Launcher.


--------

STEAM on an ext4 or other Linux filesystem.

basic outline..

format the Filesystem, get the UUID
make directory for the mount  

           mkdir /home/bob/games 
 
make fstab entry. 

      UUID=123-YOUR-UUID /home/bob/games ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0

mount the filesystem  

          sudo mount /home/bob/games 


make the Filesystem owned by your user.  

         sudo chown bob.bob /home/bob/games 


reboot to make sure it mounts.

use steam and tell it to put a steam library on /home/bob/games
install games as normal.

------------------

**ntfs3 notes**

from user mandiblesarecute who gives an example with ntfs3

      PARTLABEL=Win10     /media/win10    ntfs3   noacsrules,noatime,nofail,prealloc,sparse                                       0 0

 noacsrules **makes everything effectively 777** for when you don't need or care about fine grained access control. 
 
This 777 mode can be annoying and a security issue  in some use cases which is why it's not the default.

I had issues using  `Ntfs3`, so  for now I still use `Ntfs-3g `, i will test out ntfs3 again in the future as it matures. 


------

**Steam flatpak notes from another user. TimRambo1**

For flatpaks  you want to  use the **flatseal** tool to allow access to the filesystem mountpoint of your steam games filesystem.

example: add  mount point 
**/home/(username)/games/**

 under **filesystem** under the steam settings in **flatseal**. 

The filesystem still has to be properly mounted (as shown above)

AMD needs new hwmon interface for adjusting fan curve and that hasn't been built yet. Source: [this gitlab issue](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2402#note_1817202)

Broadly speaking, the reason for this sort of thing is that I don't think AMD cares *that* much about overclocking, *especially* on linux (where their biggest customers are probably server farms and not individual gamers) and things do tend to move a bit slower on account of the kernel release cadence.",linux_gaming

So third-party developers has actually tried to make GUIs for overclocking and fan control. It sucks indeed.

Edit: Because AMDGPU is in the Linux kernel, and the kernel has specific date releases (when new code can be injected before of at least 6 weeks, all the release candidates). So that means that AMD has to literally time their code with release when the kernel opens their code requests for evaluation/revision (cannot really ask AMD to do that).

Technically yes, but the better analogy of how immutability operates is more like a git file system. Your update come down and git commits and are layered on top of each other, at least in the case of ostree. OSTree is also able to boot any OCI container though. 

**\*Edit: It occurs to me**, that also, it's not clear that immutability in this context refers to the system being run readonly - /usr/ is only changeable in most scenarios by the ostree process. All the system files are protected, and are only changed when a new snapshot or new layer is applied.

~~Game still crashes from time to time, but hear me out.. crashing frequency is the same as Windows. Yeah.. game just likes to crash.~~ *Turns out crashing was caused by using kernel 6.2. More below.*

I'm using native steam, stock mesa and a stock kernel. Running under openSUSE Tumbleweed KDE Wayland. Using a PS5/Dualsense controller over BT.

**Minor Linux tweaks:**

\- Enabled [hugepages](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/uhfjyt/underrated_advice_for_improving_gaming/)

\- ""Performance"" CPU power profile, ""Compute"" GPU power profile (**corectrl** was used)

\- Using **AMD P-state** for the CPU

*- Edit 3: currently experimenting with kernel-tkg 6.3. It has gaming oriented tweaks and the game runs great. Original footage was taken over openSUSE's default 6.2 kernel.* 

**Steam configuration:**

Using Valve's Proton. Version: **Experimental - Bleeding Edge.**

Steam overlay is disabled.

Launch option in steam: **gamemoderun %command%**

Upper option needs ""gamemode"" installed as a package.

&#x200B;

**Important Forza settings:**

\- ""**SSAO QUALITY**"" must be off as it causes artifacts!

&#x200B;

**Hardware:**

CPU: Ryzen 5 5600x (-20 PBO / +200Mhz)

GPU: Radeon 6600xt (2700MHz / 2200MHz VRAM / -80mV)

*GPU undervolt, overclock, custom fan curve, power profiles are set with* ***corectrl*** *(graphical interface tool)*

**BIOS tweaks:**

\- Personally I have disabled fTMP and HPET in BIOS (disabling them fixed stuttering issues on Windows machines), but doubt you need to bother with them.

\- Resizable BAR/ SAM is on.

Here is how to enable AMD's Smart Access Memory (Resizable bar) on Linux:

""Above 4G decoding"" is Enabled in BIOS while ""Re-bar""/""Resizable bar"" is Disabled. We have found out that having both causes massive stutters with Gigabyte motherboards (maybe others too?). Having only ""Above 4G Decoding"" enabled provides a massive FPS boost with no stuttering. Having only ""Above 4G Decoding"" Enabled gives access to the whole memory BUS with no need for ""Re-BAR"" to be ON in BIOS. More discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/v58ts5/quick_heads_up_about_something_i_discovered/).

*~~I recon NVIDIA still has problems with this game under Linux.~~* *Seems to be better with newer proton experimental bleeding, based off of wine 8.*

Two nights ago I was going through all the things I have changed because it was running before. I explicitly remember turning TAA on and searched if it causes issues.

    ✅ Solution 1: Run sudo sh -c 'sysctl -w abi.vsyscall32=0' then reboot

jhg7qjy,Try upgrading to 6.2.11 & Mesa 23.0.x. RDNA3 support is still kind of fresh on the kernel & on Mesa. It's not impossible at this point that some critical bugs have been fixed/ironed out.,linux_gaming
jheyle7,"Definitely sounds like you're having GPU reset events.  Like Renderwahn suggested, an out of date Mesa is probably the most likely cause.  Your kernel is modern enough to use that GPU.  Hard to say about your firmware blobs.  You might benefit from fetching the latest blobs in the kernel firmware git instead of using whatever your package management system provides.

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git

You can clone this into /lib/firmware, but you'll likely run into issues with firmware provided by your package manager.

That's the main checklist for graphics:

[X] Kernel (hardware drivers)

[?] Firmware blobs (required by the hardware drivers)

[?] 3D API drivers (Mesa in this case)

[?] Display server, DRI, etc (rarely)

On a semi-related note, I've found that there is a bug somewhere in the stack currently.  At 144 Hz, the card doesn't ever exit its lowest power saving state for the memory array which leads to very slow and jerky performance.  At 120 Hz and below it works fine.",linux_gaming

It seems, the dependencies are not even fetched directly from Microsoft (if you trust this company, that is). I don't quite like that idea.

Your workflow is not defining everyone else workflow. And even then, you can give Flatpaks permission. Just like you can do with GUI applications. The thing is, nobody forces you to install a software that you don't like.

- Having to use an external monitor. If not, I have to use a weird HDMI device that allows passthrough back to the internal monitor. If I'm on the go, I have to remember to pack that device.
- Audio didn't pass through correctly for me, but [Helvum](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/helvum) fixed that.

Wasn't an problem to Google and figure out how to create and dump into one of the qemu folders. The asus-linux guide has a great section about the qemu hierarchy.
- Setting the CPU to give up exactly 14 out of 16 cores of my choosing helped performance.
- I have 40GB of RAM and use 16GB allotted to the VM.
- Perhaps a me problem, but I'm not able to switch back to having the dgpu available in Linux without changing my graphics mode from vfio to hybrid and relogging/rebooting. I don't really care.",linux_gaming
jhhxhfx,"I did not have first issue because I pass the USB device through and my Logitech keyboard shows up as Logitech and my mouse too shows up correctly, I had to use a usb hub that automatically gets hooked to the VM with the use of udev rules.

I also have a method for hot plugging GPU for Linux but I'm not sure if that works outside KDE. Basically, you set Kms to 0, set supergfxctl mode to integrated and echo 1 into `/sys/pci/rescan` and run nvidia-smi and `modprobe nvidia-drm modesetting=1` and KDE automatically detects the display. Once I'm ready to switch to vfio, I just run `supergfxctl -m integrated` again and it rmmods all the nvidia-* and then I switch to vfio. You have to unplug the display for `-m integrated` to be successful though

I use linux-zen kernel, it may not work for you...",linux_gaming

jhd1d7j,"Hi! I've been running Linux at home for something like fifteen to twenty years now. And I'd suggest that if you're new to Linux, you could consider a noob-friendly distro to to learn the ropes with. Things *will* go wrong and the more advanced your setup, the more likely you're going to need some deep magic to fix it.

You don't have to stick with it long, but I'd recommend starting out with PopOS or even plain old Ubuntu until you have a feel for the bash shell, your distro's package manager, X (or Wayland), and how to fix GRUB issues (unless you're using pure VM and it's ok to blow it all away.)

That said, nobody learns anything by playing it safe. If trying out one of these newfangled immutable distros sounds fun - go for it! Just make sure you have backups of anything important and a secondary machine you can use to fix the first... Just in case.",linux_gaming
jhc4uoa,"I personally wouldn't recommend using immutable distros since they don't have the same flexibility as other distros when it comes to gaming.

jhd0bia,"Go immutable, it's the future, you can do any changes you want to your base system, the only difference is the restart requirement.

Now for gaming better to go with OpenSuse MicroOS because it's rolling and you will always be with the latest updates of MESA and Kernel. 

It's also awesome for NVIDIA users because if a NVIDIA driver is not compatible with a newer Kernel you can hold updates on your base system while all your applications (flatpak, distrobox) update independently to their newest versions.

Distrobox yes it is CLI only for now but flatpak has you covered for most GUI applications.

I'm just waiting on the release of VanillaOS 2.0 to decide between that and MicroOS.",linux_gaming
jhdcgtv,"Personally I can't get excited about Silverblue.

Debian and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) were created to be stable operating systems. 

For example Debian has a gated process to ensure applications aren't pushed with release critical bugs. The gated process takes 6 months to a year.

While Debian releases ~2 years today there was a period it took 4-5 years between releases. Debian and RHEL will add security fixes (usually one of the quickest) but today potentially you are running 3 year old software (just with security updates).

Fedora was originally aimed as the upstream test distribution for RHEL. It pulled in the latest software and pushed it. This is known as a rolling distribution.

The issue with ""rolling"" distributions is you need to keep them updated and new software drops can contain bugs (e.g. every minor KDE release has a couple of patch releases shortly after).

This can mean you spend as much time fixing stuff as using your computer. The upside is you will get the latest drivers and features.

This is where Silverblue comes in, the idea is a gated base (similar to Debian/RHEL) where everything sits in containers so the system works.

In my opinion Red Hat Maintainers aren't very good, it feels like their primary goal is to make everything depend on GTK. In my experience Arch is more stable than Fedora. So this feels more like Red Hat compensating for not being great.

Honestly you can largely achieve the same thing by using Debian as a base and installing Flatpak versions of applications you want the latest version off.",linux_gaming
jhccj6z,"Immutable is a pain in the toucans.

jheh7m1,"I'm a no on this one.

Immutable distros have their place, I don't think that place is in personal at-home computers unless they are heavily modified or have other software buzzing around them. They are great in government, library, and educational settings, or settings where general user computing isn't the focus.

""Stability"" is talked about, a lot, without a clear definition of what people mean by it, and there is a vast valley of nuance. Immutable distros can be ""unstable"", even without you installing some random service that breaks stuff. (Even now, I'm sure people are coming up with hundreds of similar but very different definitions for ""stable"" to refute this very idea.)

To outline an example: someone running a new AMD GFX card is generally going to have a more stable experience on a rolling distro than someone with a new Nvidia Card, and someone with an old AMD or Nvidia card may not be able to leverage new drivers causing stability issues. This doesn't just apply to graphics cards either, it also applies to Wi-Fi (Realtek vs Intel), Bluetooth, motherboards with weird features that need software support, etc.

As such, stability, I would argue, is less dependent on the distro itself, or whether a file system is immutable, and more a whole picture of what you are running, as well as what distros support that setup best. Consider as well that gaming and stability don't always go well with one another. Typically modern games exist on the edge of technologies and not based on tried, true, and tested tech.

With all this said, I would gravitate towards Nobara (again depending on your setup), as there are lots of GUIs to help out, and a full CLI when you learn how to get stuff done quickly.",linux_gaming

Thank you for your well thought out post. First and most importantly, we are not trying to punish the use of Wine.
Our Windows 64-bit client is in some regards quite different from the 32-bit client. We are currently gathering telemetry to analyze and hopefully fix existing issues and prevent future ones from popping up. For this process to work, it is of utmost importance to collect data from the indented target operating system. You will also find that we blocked the usage of VMs for the very same reason.

Saying they're ""both pretty terrible"" is vague to the point that it's genuinely unhelpful to anyone, no offense. [Nazi Germany's Generalplan Ost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost) was a plan to genocide and ethnically cleanse a huge majority of Eastern Europe, and would've lead to the deaths of tens to hundreds of millions of people. Even the Holodomor is a drop in the bucket compared to that, and **the USSR was fascistic** and state capitalist **whilst disguising itself as a communist**, putting down actual socialist protestors.

Lenin and Stalin betrayed the revolution, and Trotsky slaughtered Makhnovia. But make no mistake, the Nazis were genocidal maniacs who were far, far, ***far*** worse. Stalin and Hitler also nearly worked together, so, meh, take what you will.

It was to be undertaken in territories occupied by Germany during World War II. The plan was attempted during the war, resulting indirectly and directly in the deaths of millions by shootings, starvation, disease, extermination through labor, and genocide. However, its full implementation was not considered practicable during major military operations, and never materialized due to Germany's defeat.

I don't think you're from Europe, no European would ever say that. My mum's family was taken to Siberia, and half of them either starved or froze to death. The ones who managed to escape and came back home were persecuted and killed if caught. There are tons of stories and records that prove how the Soviets committed horrible acts while claiming to save Europe from the Nazis. Some that lived through both occupations believed they were worse than the Nazis themselves. Here are some of the atrocities the soviets did to its supposed allies:

* Estonia: After occupying Estonia in 1940, the Soviet Union launched a campaign of terror against the Estonian people. This campaign involved the forced conscription of Estonians into the Red Army, mass deportations to Siberia, and executions. Additionally, in 1941, Soviet forces committed a war crime by carrying out the mass murder of Estonian civilians in the village of Viru.

* Latvia: The Soviet Union occupied Latvia in 1940 and immediately began a campaign of terror against the Latvian people. This included mass deportations, executions, and the forced conscription of Latvians into the Red Army. In 1941, Soviet forces also carried out the mass murder of Latvian civilians in the village of Cesvaine.

* Lithuania: In 1940, Lithuania was taken over by the Soviet Union, and the Lithuanian population suffered from a series of terrifying actions, including being forcibly deported to Siberia, executed, and Lithuanians being made to join the Red Army against their will. Additionally, in the same year, Soviet troops were responsible for the slaughter of Lithuanian civilians in Rainiai village.

* Ukraine: In Ukraine, the Soviet Union perpetrated several acts of war crimes, such as the Holodomor, a forced famine that caused the death of millions of Ukrainians. Moreover, during World War II, Soviet troops committed multiple atrocities, including the massacre of Ukrainian Jews in Babi Yar.

* Poland: The Katyn massacre was a mass execution of Polish prisoners of war by Soviet forces in the spring of 1940. The victims, who numbered around 22,000, were officers, policemen, and other members of the Polish intelligentsia. The Soviets carried out the executions as part of their efforts to eliminate the Polish elite and prevent any potential resistance to Soviet rule.

The list provided is just a small fraction of the Soviet Union's crimes. It only scratches the surface. Make no mistake, the soviets were no better than the nazis.

Fascists require constant targets; obsession with a plot. 

Make no mistake though, if I had to choose between living in the USSR or living under Nazi Germany, I would kill myself, but if even that were off the table, I would have a very small preference towards the USSR, because at least I wouldn't be dead or worse, used as a test dummy for the sick, fucked up experiments that the Nazi doctors perform on people they see as inferior, I would just be freezing my ass off in Siberia and would probably then be shot and/or die of hypothermia.

Fact of the matter is, I'm not trying to convince you that somehow communism is 'better' than Nazism, because that would be working within your definition of communism, which I would say is more akin to modern day China (aka a totalitarian state capitalist hellhole where people disappear), than the literal Marxist definition, that is to say, a society that is classless, stateless and moneyless, which I'm sure you can agree would be wonderful and way better than even the society we live under right now.

If you don't have VRR and want proper frame pacing for these games you need to use a vsync-based frame limiter that blocks on the GPU. Options are either what you did and switch the monitor to 60hz, or use something like dxvk's `dxgi.syncInterval` option, setting it to 2 would limit to 60 fps on a 120 hz screen with proper pacing.

But tbh, considering that you have a high end GPU like a 3080ti, you probably also have a VRR-capable monitor, and using a single monitor on x11 should mean there are no road blocks to using it.

Create a file in /etc/systemd/system/ named ""change-performance-level.service"". So, the full path would be /etc/systemd/system/change-performance-level.service. Then paste the code block below into that file:

```

Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c ""echo 'high' > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level""

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save and exit. Then follow it up with a `sudo systemctl enable change-performance-level`, to activate the service.

jh7wjqo,"Since you mentioned being new to Linux:  X11 and Wayland are protocols for displaying graphics.  In practice, the names of the protocols are used sort of interchangeably with the display server software that runs on a computer that provides that interface.

Your desktop environment and graphical software run on top of whichever system it's compatible with.  Wayland is much more modern, built with contemporary GPU hardware in mind.  X11 has a deeper history spanning back to the late 80s.  It's essentially EOL but still has the best support.

That's what you were testing here.  You found that your issue existed when running through Wayland but not X11.  This suggested an issue related to the display server in use.  Wayland was probably running with vsync, so anything drawing through it would be limited by vsync also.  X11 doesn't run with vsync (TearFree) by default, so it sort of made sense.

There exists DRI also (direct rendering, bypassing the display server).  It's something to be aware of, but it didn't come into play in your scenario.",linux_gaming

jh51f6a,"Some clarifications:

- HDR is not supported on desktop Linux generally, regardless of which display format you use. It is available, albeit in a very experimental form, through Valve's Gamescope. Experimenting with this is very messy as of right now, and doesn't even work with all HDR games. This is a problem that is actively being worked on.
- Other variable refresh rate technology, like Freesync and G-Sync (through Nvidia proprietary drivers) is available. HDMI 2.1 VRR is not fully available (see below)
- General HDMI 2.1 support is available through Nvidia proprietary drivers, and IIRC Intel Arc GPUs as well due to the hardware containing active DisplayPort -> HDMI conversion. I am not sure if HDMI VRR works with those solutions or not. It is legally problematic to support HDMI 2.1 in open source drivers due to how it specifically is licensed, but the latest update in this space is that AMD Legal is evaluating what they are able to deliver in the space.

I am hopeful that these issues will be resolved in the future, but it is unwise to make an expensive purchase based on hopes and dreams for future support. I, like you, am in the market for a display that supports both HDR and some form of VRR, but will be limiting myself to DisplayPort 1.4-compatible displays as I am using an AMD RX 6xxx GPU that I do not plan on upgrading for a very long time (constraining my screen size, and max resolution/refresh rate).",linux_gaming
jh5gtax,I would try to stick with DisplayPort for the best feature support.  HDMI is a crapshoot.,linux_gaming
jh51p9c,"Only option if you actually want to game at 4k 120hz w/ VRR is nvidia. HDMI closed the spec without paying, which makes implementing it into the Linux display stack incredibly difficult legally. AMD is trying to fix this, and while Intel does support it it is exclusive to Intel and Arc still sucks on Linux for gaming

HDR is in the works, Wayland needs a protocol and there's a host of display stack implementations that need to be finalized still. Maybe by the end of the year",linux_gaming
jh5zvae,"I have a 42 LG C2 and can confirm that i can do 4k 120hz including VRR with a Radeon 7900 XTX card. It seems like they included it in the Firmware blob instead of the open source code because the IGPU of the Ryzen 7000 cannot do 4k 120hz when it should be HDMI 2.1 capable.

~~I did chroma tests and cannot any errors there, so i can only assume its true HDMI 2.1 that being used.~~  I managed to find the diagnotics HDMI Menu of the C2 and can confirm its still only HDMI 2.0, its using Chroma 4:2:0 to get to 4k 120hz.

It really seems like they ""hacked"" it in, because if i try to read out EDID infos with tools they all report ""unknown edid infos"" and other errors.

Im using arch with 6.2 kernel and plasma kde as UI.

But this is definitely new behavior, at the end of 2022 with a 6800 XT i could only do 4k 60hz and needed a HDMI 2.1 to DP 1.4 converter to get 4k 120hz.

VRR does seem to work but I haven't really messed with it too much as I'd rather just set it to the 120fps setting. However, I have confirmed the C2 does recognize the AMD VRR in the settings once it is turned on (using Wayland).

You likely will have issues with VRR in a multi-monitor setup but I just use the C2 as my only monitor and have generally had a really good experience. I just finished playing through Horizon Zero Dawn.

I use blackout curtains in my room and it's plenty bright enough if sunlight isn't hitting it.

In ""game ready"" drivers it mostly comes down to replacing game provided shaders with vendor optimized ones, but in more complicated cases an entire code paths are bypassed and live patched by the driver.

This is a sad state of things, ideally the bugs should be fixed by the ones who created them, not worked around by some third party.

It would obviously be a stunt, since Valve is a company and needs money from sales, and Windows is very obviously a larger platfrom then Linux/Steam OS at the mo. 

Being multiplatform requires dev time to support all the platforms you support. Games become exclusive because of corpo agreements, but also because the devs don't have money/time/knowledge to support certain platforms. They have to make choices on which basket to put the eggs in. 

In an ideal world every game would be an open source passion project that is available on every platform, yes.

There's a good reason as to why DXVK is by far the easiest way to fix Sims 2s graphical problems on modern systems and is considered essential to fix the bodgy performance of Fallout New Vegas and GTA IV, in all three cases because it includes specific fixes/workarounds for known issues that aren't necessarily still shipped with the drivers for your brand new GPU due to the age of the game.",linux_gaming

Yeah AMDVLK is a little bit faster on raw rasterizing (on synthetic tests at least) but still much slower on most tasks [ćompare it yourself if you want to](https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead) which makes it much slower on most cases with DXVK/VKD3D (not always though) and stuttery.

Publisher-specific launchers (e.g. ubisoft, ea) are the safest in this sense, as long as you trust these publishers not to push malware (there have been a few cases of launchers integrating questionable data collection practices etc.) .

Steam and itch allow anyone to publish so both have the potential for people to use them to push malware. I know it's happened with steam, and I assume it's happened with itch too. That's the price for a more indie-accessible platform, and so far it seems well worth the trade.

Steam presumably runs sort of virus scan (itch may as well), but malware can slip through - although steam seems to pretty quick to remove malware. I can't speak to itch's speed at removing malware but given they're smaller than valve they're probably a little slower - but itch is hardly known for being filled with malware so it doesn't seem like a huge issue. Steam's slightly higher barrier to publishing probably helps a little too.

The best solution would, as you allude to, be running only vetted open-source software. Alas, this is not really practical if you want to play more than a handful of decent games. The next best option is limiting the damage that can be done (flatpak is a convenient way to achieve this in my view).

jh5vhue,"Systemd services are about controlling the userspace processes. Kernel modules are in the kernel space.

Why it's hard to update the kernel or kernel modules without a reboot? Because  they're designed that way. It's easier to write a kernel that doesn't have this feature. It's just software like everything else. There are efforts to do live patching, there are other OS/kernels/systems that have no-downtime updates as their primary feature.",linux_gaming
jh7wav6,"On AMD, AFAIK, you don't need to reboot for most driver updates because the userspace (non-kernel) mesa driver does not require a specific kernel driver version and the important parts of the driver are in userspace.

On Nvidia, the userspace (non-kernel) part of the proprietary driver requires the kernelspace part to have the same version so a userspace driver update also requires a kernel driver update. It is possible to, stop all graphical processes, unload the kernel driver using `rmmod` or `modprobe -r`, load (`modprobe`) the updated kernel driver then start graphical processes again but this is typically considered more trouble than it's worth.

Pcie4 and 5 are huge speed upgrades and MASSIVE price hikes, but you will not saturate those connections with consumer SSDs. The mentioned Aorus drive barely beats pcie4 drives in any realistic tests, it just kills at sequential writes, as expected. It is not useful at all for 90% of people.

Windows has had support for PCVR from Day One seven years ago. I don't do Linux VR constantly, but the responses are still very mixed in this very forum. Supposedly now ALVR is just as good as Windows with the Quest 2. And in my opinion ALVR is nowhere even the native Meta client, based on my use of it in Windows. Not that I've tried to figure it out. I just use the Meta client.

Windows has had HDR for five years. It's just not getting seamless. Fear not, soon Linux will be better. Ray tracing, fear not soon which was two years and it's extremely iffy. It goes on and on and on.

I'm not blaming Linux but the notion that these technologies instantly become better on Linux is preposterous. But all of these command lines to do things I never even had to think about. I just don't think some Linux fans hear themselves and are so whatever that they think that Microsoft just screws ever thing up. When Windows has had HDR tech working 5 years ago.

And game capability and performance are a lot iffier than conventional games. So yes, VR can work under Linux but it's clearly well behind Windows. 

As for HDR coming this year, sure the basics might be there but then there's going to be need for more driver support, Proton integration, work on DEs, etc. It's taken Windows years to get decent with HDR support and even after it's available for general use it'll take years to straighten things out. 

Raytracing and DLSS generally work but seem to be more problematic. Frame generation doesn't work yet, not sure what the progress is.

I know this is higher end stuff that caters to a small PC market but it's even that much smaller under Linux.

What's sky rocketed Windows compatibility. Nothing wrong with that, just not necessarily of practical benefit to folks running Windows. Privacy and security concerns are valid, but in an era where people are attached to smartphones that are tracking their every movement, I consider that a mostly BS argument. If Windows is too invasive, most every other connected tech people use is as well. It's a meaningless argument in a world that long traded convivence and easy access over privacy.

>I enjoy gaming in Linux and that's all it matters to me.

I've countless times said that Linux gaming is viable and, in some situations, can be better than Windows. One situation I press against is new games and hardware.

Like the Linus videos from last year. ""But his hardware!"" Right, that new expensive hardware that costs 1000 times the going market price of Windows, that's the problem. Complete and nothing more than blame the user BS for obvious developer flaws.

Team, unlike Skype, seems to matter more. If it doesn't benefit them, and it does not, why are they providing inferior builds of their software on Linux? It's because they realize that if they don't a competing app will take their place and grow in popularity alongside Linux's growing market share.

I've always thought this to be ironic. Valve, the company that's invested the most in Linux PC gaming every month releases a survey that kind of makes Linux look irrelevant. If it were Microsoft releasing these numbers then sure, you could think that Microsoft was lying.

Not saying that these numbers are spot on by if they weren't accurate after all these years, you'd kind of think that Valve would have just pulled this tool or fixed it or anything besides to constantly state inaccurate numbers that make Linux look bad.

Proton is great but just getting a bunch of Windows games to run on Linux isn't as compelling as some Linux fans think. Windows too is good at running Windows games. And for new releases it's much better supported.

But until recently the issue was for cases above monitor max refresh rate, where you couldn't get tearing if you wanted to. Now there is an option for it.

I generally disable vsync option in games to prevent games doing anything extra for it which can result in forcing fifo mode for example. Then I just limit framerate at monitor's max refresh rate - 1 and let adaptive sync handle the rest.

If you want some lower latency, you can avoid capping and allow tearing or mailbox above the range for cases that can reach or benefit from it. Though I don't see a lot of value in that if your monitor has high enough max refresh rate which modern monitors easily provide.

Also, try KDE instead of Gnome. Gnome's take on presentation modes in relation to gaming is not very good - it takes them a lot of time plumbing things up unlike KDE. So some of your problems are likely not related to Wayland, they are related to Gnome.",linux_gaming

Wayland + freesync Is perfection.",linux_gaming

This is fifo present mode in vulkan terms.

If you turn vsync off, then Wayland will currently emulate this by using a mailbox present mode, which will allow the game to run with unlimited frame rate, but still sync every frame to vblank (potentially discarding excess frames if it runs way faster than the monitor's max refresh) and not tear.

If you want to turn vsync on or off in the game settings will pretty much only depend on if you want unlimited frame rates or not and shouldn't change much else. So option C from your list is the most correct.

However, once the Wayland tearing protocol gets plumed through the whole stack (can't tell you when that'll be the case or be available in distros or other compositors than kwin), vsync off should again work as you'd expect from x11 or windows, meaning unlimited frame rate with possible tearing.",linux_gaming

Which takes exactly? Gnome behaves exactly the same with regards to present modes as KDE does.. The only difference right now is that they don't support vrr (which has no influence on the used present mode) and that they don't support the tearing protocol yet to allow immediate present mode (which doesn't work on kwin for anything in practice either yet due to missing mesa and xwayland support).",linux_gaming

> I generally disable vsync option in games to prevent games doing anything extra for it which can result in forcing fifo mode for example. Then I just limit framerate at monitor's max refresh rate - 1 and let adaptive sync handle the rest.

You should make clear that this is only a decent option on a monitor and compositor that support VRR. Otherwise this will lead to terrible frame pacing with vsync, or horrible tearing without.

* Switch to using Steam Linux Runtime - Sniper for the built engines. This provides newer tooling for builds, which should make future development easier, for example being able to build qt 5.15 and have gcc 10 available. The 100+ engines have been re-built. Note that previous clients should still work on the older soldier, but any new updates will only happen to sniper (this client and above). If you run into any issues with the engines, please open a new issue in the [packages](https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/issues/new/choose) repo.
* Rust panics, if they occur, should now be caught and displayed in the Godot UI.
* [dreamer] Use steamlocate v2 alpha
* Bump h2 from 0.3.15 to 0.3.17

As well, lot of engine/package updates occured as well: https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#630-2023-04-13

To install games to this drive from lutris, the easiest way is to, ensure that your owners on the files on the drive with `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $MNT`, make a directory under the mountpoint e.g. `mkdir $MNT/lutris` and then, in lutris, install GOG to `$MNT/lutris`. 

Another option is the keep the original GOG installation, find the location that it is installed to and inside its wineprefix, create a subdirectory (call it `$DIR`), create a bind mount (`sudo mount --bin $MNT/lutris $DIR`) or symbolic link (`ln -sr $MNT/lutris $DIR`) to the drive and then configure the GOG launcher to install to that directory.

Compatibility-wise you're limited to 2 platforms:
- SteamVR native: Vive, Vive Pro, Index
- ALVR: Quest 1, 2 and I think Pro

There are some attempts like OpenHMD and Monado in order to get other headsets working on Linux (ex. Rift S) but not everything is implemented yet",linux_gaming
jgzp525,"> Question 1 : about this, can I mix headset, controlers and base stations from different vendors ?

It doesn't matter which base stations from which vendor you use, as long as they are V2 or V1 depending on which headset you choose. Valve Index is V2, HTC Vive is V1, HTC Vive Pro is V2.

V1 base stations are compatible with V2 headsets, but not the other way around.

You can in theory mix and match controllers as long as they are compatible with Linux but I would recommend sticking with one to prevent issues.

> Am I missing some hardware for linux ?

As long as you have a decent AMD or Nvidia card and a solid USB 3 port you should be fine. Can't speak for Intel cards, not sure if they support VR on Linux.

> Which one will be the easiest to use for simple VR ? And for the full body ?

Valve Index and HTC Vive are the easiest as they work out of the box on Linux.

For full body tracking you can either use HTC trackers or the Tundra Labs trackers. They both work out of the box.

> Which one has the best display ?

Best is relative but the Index is 4 years old by now and the display isn't the best anymore. I have never used them but the HTC Vive Pro 2 and the new Quest 2 are supposed to have very good displays. Some of the Windows Mixed Reality headsets have excellent displays but they don't work under Linux from what I have seen.

> For the Quest 2 with ALVR, is it required to make a Facebook account ? (I've never used FB for the obvious reasons)

I stopped using Oculus products after the DK2 so I can't really give you a response there. I have heard that it requires one but there may be ways around it.

> Question 3 : which setup would you recommend for the best VR experience ?

SteamVR is a pain in the ass as is but the Valve Index definitely provides the best out of the box experience and is much newer than the HTC Vive.",linux_gaming
jh06qt2,">Which one will be the easiest to use for simple VR ? And for the full body ?

On Linux, probably the Index. But steamvr on linux is kind of jank regardless of your setup and has been neglected by valve for years. Also keep in mind that many proton/steam play games don't work well in VR (like HL2:VR mod).

>Which one has the best display ?

Too subjective. What is important to you? Refresh rate, FOV, colour fidelity, resolution?

The trackers both require base stations but do not come with base stations because people usually buy them together with a headset or after they already bought a headset. I'm using the Tundra trackers right now in SteamVR and they work fine, although there's not a lot of games that support full body tracking.

> Isn't the HTC Vive Pro also compatible with Linux ? How is it compared to the Valve Index ?

Good question, I'm not a 100% sure if the Vive Pro also works on Linux. Compared to the Index, at least the controllers are far superior.

The Index controllers really add another layer of immersion with the finger tracking. Looking at the specifications, the headsets look quite similar.

It can be. But it's not as plug and play, and you'll forever have to deal with encoder/network/decoder stuff, which puts hard limits on latency and image quality. Q2 is much cheaper and still has great displays, though.

Installed ubisoft connect from lutris and the only problem was the stupid ""looking for patches..."" infinite loop bug. You disable fsync and esync from settings and you can solve the problem (then you can re-enable them).

Once the ubisoft connect client actually opened, from there it was a one-click install and play the game!!!! It was great! I got easily 144fps 1080p, high settings. I played for 2 hours straight without a single problem or disconnect.

jgz4wfu,"I use an 8BitDo Pro 2 that likely suffers from similar issues. You can make it work with a bit of tweaking, including the Gyro. I can't speak to the adapter since I don't have it, but I have full Switch mode functionality via Bluetooth with the steps below.

**Gyro and Steam Behavior -** Steam does work with the Gyro in Switch mode if you give it direct access to the controller. Likely the problem you are facing is that Linux actually has a kernel driver for Nintendo controllers that will pick it up for general controller use, and Steam can't get the gyro input from this driver currently. Steam can use raw access to the controller device instead (via hidraw). To achieve this, you can [blacklist hid-nintendo](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3270624/blacklisting-modules-on-linux.html), then after a reboot the device will show up as an available hidraw device and Steam will pick it up with full functionality. Keep in mind that the controller will not work outside of Steam while this module is blacklisted.

**Extra Buttons -** The back bumper buttons need to be mapped to other buttons or a macro to be useful in *any* modes, since none of the consoles actually have native support for these buttons as their own inputs (unless this has changed recently?). You can do this via the [phone app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abitdo.advance). I have not tried to get the desktop app working on Linux since the phone app suits my needs. It can even intercept the controller while its paired to your PC for configuration tweaks.

**Switch Mode Digital Triggers -** Lastly, as mentioned by others, the Switch mode has digital triggers only. You can adjust the deadzone for their actuation in the phone app, but no analog triggers in Switch mode. You have to pick between gyro and analog triggers on this controller.

FYI these limitations are all the same in Windows as well, other than access to a native desktop app for controller configuration and firmware updating.",linux_gaming
jgxq7ff,"I have no problems on arch after installing [udev rules](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/8bitdo-ultimate-controller-udev)
Even the adapter works. The controller shows up as a regular xinput device whenever it's undocked.",linux_gaming
jgxq5bg,"The triggers are digital in Switch mode because that's the standard there. Having to pick between analog triggers and gyro controls is thus a best case for using the controller.

I had a good experience on windows, sad to see it be such a hassle on Linux. I used it relatively briefly before handing it to a friend, I believe the software for configuring onboard profiles and assigning the back buttons is only available for windows.

I should check out SteamOS functionality on Deck when I get the chance.",linux_gaming

jh0ruly,"> some posts have been relying on some services + xboxdrv to make sure it works under SteamOS

Why are people using xboxdrv on an OS that integrates Steam Input??? Before the current iteration of SteamOS was a thing, you could use Steam to create mappings for unknown controllers that would then be exposed to SDL2 and Wine via environment variables.

It is so frustrating to use arch recently because most packages just get pushed with bugs: ibus, grub, even plasma crashes are something I've started to become used to. The ""arch breaks when you update"" was starting to become a meme because it never happened, now I'm doing my best keep my arch install alive sweating every time there's an update that it won't be bugged or broken.

The quality of updates is making me question why I even bother, arch stopped being the OS I install and do everything on and is starting to become an obstacle to my everyday use, yet nobody talks about this and people recommend endeavour or archinstall and I question if anybody talking about these distros even use arch to begin with.

Generally speaking newer software has more bugs fixed.

Oh, and then there was that time when I removed the boot loader on accident. That was also my fault.

What I'm surprised is by the fast rise of Garuda Linux. I suppose it is basically the more Arch-compliant gaming-oriented distro that people would naturally flock to if they're not using Arch directly, Endeavor, or moving on from Manjaro.

I'm quite happy with that -- I used it for around two years on my gaming rig, only changing because I took the grub breakage as a chance to restart with a cleaner config on another distro. Despite its garish default theme on their flagship image, it is still a pretty good distro with a ton of cool GUI tools and good community. They used to be more unstable with too much default tweaks, but moving to linux-zen (over linux-tkg-pds) and relegating the tweaks to their Garuda tools menu made it a lot more sane OOTB experience (again, themes aside).

Also, I still use chaotic-aur on distrobox and conty as well as whenever I drive an Arch-based to this day. They're just super convenient. And after two years of using the distro? I trust them enough to not do anything funky with their builds.

Aside from that, it's configured just about exactly how I would want a desktop OS to be set up before putting any of my friends or family in front of it.  It has reasonable desktop and gaming oriented tweaks (ie latency over throughput), it preinstalls decent apps (something I think is good for a general purpose distro, as it's easier for an experienced user to just uninstall something than for a new user to know what to install), and it keeps all that updated.  The official version of a modified Gnome is laid out like Windows/KDE and is going to be reasonably accessible to people coming in from Windows, but it also has an unmodified GNOME and actual KDE versions.

I do think ""gaming distro"" can be applied to other distros though.  Obviously SteamOS and ChimeraOS are very literally gaming distros, they go for a more HTPC-like setup to make them a functional console OS, with gamepad navigable menus, there's RetroPi and other similar projects meant to turn a low end device into an emulation machine you can put in front of kids, but there's also experiments like CachyOS that do promise improved FPS in games by precompiling binaries to favor newer hardware (by breaking legacy hardware support) - something that's obviously not ideal for new users who aren't going to know whether their hardware's going to be supported, but might be interesting for people who want Arch with more performance but don't want to use Intel's Clear Linux.

Manjaro doesn't have the resources to. Things like creating a package manager to connect to a web service that does not offer an API, can only be done properly if you have money and resources to throw at this problem, which manjaro does not, hence why their package manager has been improperly made and ddossed the aur 3 times.

Humans are not perfect and make mistakes. Manjaro is by far not the only Linux distribution that has made mistakes. Why hasn't Arch Linux received this level of criticism every time something breaks?

In addition, the article states that two of the three things wrong with Manjaro have nothing to do with how the actual Linux operating system runs and the user experience. The third one from distrowatch may likely have been an outlier, in terms of hardware configuration, user experience and knowledge, or the specific Manjaro image version had issues with their hardware. Without seeing logs of why the installer crashed, or other programs crashed, it's hard to say why it happened. The author could have had a great opportunity to interact with the Manjaro forum to figure it out and help the development of the OS. I'm given the impression that without the author trying to resolve why this happened, it's not really a fair and unbiased review. Particularly when the problems seems to point at either a corrupted image download, or a failing USB flash drive it was installed from, which points at user error. Yeah, it's not good press in terms of what their image is to users, but it looks like Arch and EndevourOS got bitten by the GRUB problem that effected a certain amount of people too. Every Linux distribution encounters problems. 

I actually just switched over to Manjaro from Linuxmint that I had been using for over ten years I think. It's lovely to see newly updated kernels and software that never happened with conservative Linux distributions like Linuxmint. And I honestly think Steam and it's games works better on my system, as well as my CPU. I tested out Manjaro on a second PC for at least two years prior with infrequent updating of it every three to four months. And I only ran into two problems that were not that difficult to fix, and one of them was a user error as things work a bit differently in Manjaro than Linuxmint. 

I wanted to consider EndevourOS as a possibility, but at the time there was still no GUI update manager to notify users of updates and apply them. It seems that has now changed. I'm happy to see that. :)  I might install it on my secondary PC now as a test to see how I like it. 

I currently have no issue with Manjaro. I participate in the forum to help it get better as I'm able to. If at some point something changes for me, I'll look for another Linux distribution to use, just like I did jumping ship from Linuxmint. I feel like some people here want to play Linux distributions like team sports, and divide the whole Linux community.  There is no one distribution that is best.

jgtoeji,"Most literally, it's based on the Archlinux project so the differences between them will be negligible for an experience.

Major differences between Archlinux and Manjaro, (based on Arch) are:

1. Manjaro have maintainers for their own package repositories and their own unique packages for their distro rather than just pointing at Archlinux's mirrors. This also includes stable, testing and unstable branches rather than Archlinux's approach to having bleeding edge versions available in the repo the same afternoon they're released as the only choice.

2. It's intentionally designed to be more user friendly (Though recently archiso now has an easy to use installer script provided as a command in the iso these days)

Overall they're trying to give that familiar pacman-powered package experience that Arch provides but with optional slower package movement for an optional package stability experience. For any problems you'll encounter the Archwiki will still be the best knowledgebase hands down as it is for many distros regardless. You can still use Arch User Repository packages on Manjaro, though they may build expecting the bleeding edge Arch package experience so it's theoretically possible to run into environmental issues trying some of them on Manjaro.

Personally I'd stay far away from it and just go for an Archlinux installation.

In addition to using fedora's repositories, nobara also uses fedora's build system (fedora's AUR alternative that precompiles packages), meaning all the updates are automated, even those of custom compiled software, like the kernel. Nobara's ""team"" (mostly just that one guy, ge) only has to step in if the fedora system fails to compile. However, because every one of these custom softwares, aside from the kernel, is maintained by ge for other purposes as well, it is trivially easy to keep the entire thing running without touching anything.

Nobara requires minimal resources to operate because it doesn't deviate from any of the core philosophies of fedora, and can take advantage of existing resources. However, manjaro does deviate from arch's philosophies significantly, and therefore needs resources that their tean can't provide.

That's why I've always argued that manjaro would be a better distro if based on opensuse. Opensuse's stable release still offers very new packages. Additionally, opensuses AUR alternative offers an api, but they have no gui frontend, meaning manjaro would be able to create one less philosophically broken than what they have for arch. And I would love to see opensuse's gui for managing just about everything on your system, yast, be updated to look more modern, but also include a kernel manager like manjaro has. And it would be less broken because unlike arch, opensuse actually supports multiple versions of the same kernel installed at once.

The biggest cause of issues I've had is when I've installed or updated one specific package, but others are outdated, which can cause incompatibilities.

They only officially support and test running all of the latest versions of packages from the repositories together.

So basically, never specifically update an individual package (especially system ones), always update everything. If you install some new packages, it's good practice to do a full update afterwards.

In case you do get into the situation where it's failing to boot, keep a Live USB around. You can boot into that, mount your file systems, and use `arch-chroot` to chroot into it. The vast majority of times where I've been in this situation with Arch failing to boot, it's been fixed by doing this and then running a `pacman -Syu` to update all the packages.

- Get rid of the ""uncertifid device"" error through https://www.google.com/android/uncertified - for this you'll need your android id, which you can get using the following command (after submitting your android id to google you'll need to wait 10-20 Minutes for the changes to take effect. You may also need to wipe the cache of the Google Play Services app)
```
echo 'ANDROID_RUNTIME_ROOT=/apex/com.android.runtime sqlite3 /data/data/com.google.android.gsf/databases/gservices.db ""select * from main;""' | sudo waydroid shell | grep android_id

- Install ARM instruction translation (libndk) into your android image. The waydroid_script tool helps a lot with this: https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script

With all this done, you should be able to log into Google Play and download Goose Goose Duck from there.

I personally recommend the KDE version of Manjaro as a distro because I hate GNOME, It's a rolling release and wanted something more Windows-like in it's layout, but it's all down to personal choice; I can see some love for Garuda and POP\_OS! in the comments which is great because you can try any Linux distro by booting an image of the distro you want to try off of a USB stick. Additionally, be aware of what the distro you chose is based on; it's easier to dig up an existing solution for a problem with an Ubuntu-derived system than a problem with something, say, Arch-derived. This is not to say that you wont be able to get help with problems (you will), but that there may be extra steps and those extra steps did not stop me from continuing with Manjaro.

&#x200B;

In terms of hurdles, you will potentially have them if you have an NVIDIA card because NVIDIA doesn't opensource their drivers (which are often janky) so they can't simply be baked into the kernel like AMD and Intel ones can. ProtonDB will have most of the answers as to whether or not your games are playable, assuming they're on steam and you have them on steam. If you have a second drive, do not mount it in the home folder; you will make your shiny new install cry when you try to reboot. Doing something like `sudo mkdir /mnt/storage` and then mounting it from there (and possibly taking ownership with `sudo chown /mnt/storage`) would work.

The other reason to go with a gaming oriented distro for gaming, is that they're generally rolling releases, or frequently update  packages relevant to gaming so you get the latest and greatest, which can be quite nice if someone has a gaming-heureka-epiphany and comes up with something cool that'll take months or years to get into an LTS-distro, or you're on some new hardware that need the latest drivers or benefit from driver-maturation.

So rather than list distros for you to use, it's probably easier to say what not to use. If you want to game don't use:

* Kali-linux, or some other professionally or specific task-oriented distro outside of gaming.
* LTS-versions of distros, you'll miss out on free performance from latest updates. This also applies (to a lesser degree) to bi-annual release distros for the same reason.

Other than that, I'd say try surfing some different Desktop Environments on youtube and see what floats your aesthetic boat, and pick distro based on that; but if we're talking strictly gaming distros the three that comes to mind are [Nobara Project](https://nobaraproject.org/) ,[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/) and [PikaOS](https://pika-os.com/).",linux_gaming

This question appears here like few times every week. Should be added to FAQ and banned. Nothing new can be said there, to do it that often. **People did answer** btw, despite downvoting.

This one is kinda relevant indeed, despite Insurgency Sandstorm is Windows-only, as the question is more about Wine/Proton in general.

> basic general questions

Yet another ""I gonna install the game 'I Won't tell you the name' under my 'I won't tell you the OS', and want to also install 'I won't tell you the mod name' on it question. Not surprised it's downvoted.

> someone politely asking for help

Pure offtopic and unrelated to gaming, should be deleted by mods, not downvoted.

We should. However some stuff is just offtopic. It's a sub about **Linux Gaming**. Not general Linux questions, not Wine gaming, not PS5 gaming, etc.

That posts are downvoted doesn't necessary mean this isn't the place for it. Sometimes it does, sometimes not. Trolls, or even just average majority (it's not necessary vast majority) isn't a reason to remove the flair/tag.

> I found one example on the main page of users actually engaging in a question.

If by main page you mean the default sorting. It's reddit. I have ""New"" bookmarked instead, so that's my (own, unofficial) ""default"". I'm pretty sure many people do the same. Not necessary with a bookmark, maybe just by clicking ""New"" every time they open a sub.

While you are TECHNICALLY correct, you are not practically correct.

Sure you can use ubuntu and have a stable system, but for gaming a bleeding edge or close to it is preffered due to optimizations, or you would have to install literal test/beta software.
One example being rhel. Sure, it is STABLE AF, but you wouldn't game on it as the kernel and every package would be too old in order for it to practically work, unless you actually have the hours needed to set it up properly and then maintaining it.
In this case ubuntu would be preferred as it would be easier, and most importantly, quicker to set up properly.
An even better choice would be fedora, not as easy as ubuntu to set up for gaming, but you don't need hours for it!

Or, how about the unofficial spinoff of fedora that GE has made, named Nobara. Just install and within 30 min you can be gaming without any major hassle. Even had a friend install it as he was interested and he loved it. Just plug and play, so to speak.

Ofc, ymmv as with everything but this has been my experience.

Yes, this is true. I encountered that doind my unofficial native ports of Unity games. It's kinda 50/50 for modern games without official native version, depending of what exactly devs used. With Godot the situation is much better in practice, 19 of 20 games only officially released for Windows I tried, worked with no issues on Linux version of Godot.

jgv7lvf,"u/FunJackfruit5596

So, I went ahead and tried appimage and snap packages.

First I made appimage executable, it ran but got frozen without launch any GUI.

Then I tried the snap package with following command to be able to install without signatures as there wasn't any provided;

    sudo snap install AlderonGamesLauncher-1.1.79.snap --dangerous

This time it installed but running the launcher resulted crash without launching any GUI instead of freezing.

jgvnmvg,"Wine prefix:

Think of it as a mini windows installation. Each time you run a program in wine, you run it in one specific prefix. That way you can have multiple prefixes if you want, with each configured differently and with different programs installed. Also, 32 bit, or 64 bit prefixes, since some programs require one or the other. The default prefix is usually in your home directory in a folder .wine

This does take a decent amount of extra space on your disk, since each prefix has a lot of files. But, this is still small compared to any modern-ish games.

There are many ways of managing wine prefixes:

\- Command line

\- winetricks

\- Bottles

\- Lutris (it does a lot of other things too, not just wine)

\- Steam play (specifically for games using Proton, a special version of wine)

\- ... several others

These tools might put your wine prefixes in a different location in your home directory.

But, they are all doing a similar thing, which is helping you make new prefixes, configure prefixes, and install programs into those prefixes.

Proton (as used in Steam play) is more or less also doing the same thing. That is, creating a wine prefix and installing a program. One program per prefix. You can find the prefix for each game if you search in your Steam data folder. This is separate to the actual game files.

Proton-GE is a modified version of proton (and therefore wine). In Steam, you can make a game run via Steam play, but specify that it will use Proton-GE (instead of a version of Proton). That usually brings some benefits for games that don't have well established compatibility with regular wine or Proton.

I believe that wine-GE brings the updates and fixes that are in Proton-GE, into wine. That way you can run a game from e.g. Lutris, but using wine-GE, instead of one of the other wine versions that Lutris has access to.

Other thing, most of the programs above (Bottles, Lutris, Steam) are using their own versions of wine, not so called ""system"" wine (although you can configure a game in Lutris to use system wine). System wine would be, what you get installed on your system from your distro's archives e.g. via ""sudo apt install wine"". You don't need system wine installed to use e.g. Lutris or run games via Steam play (Proton). But, if you run games (or windows programs) from the command line, or e.g. winetricks, you will need system wine installed.",linux_gaming
jgvj29p,"Well, it kinda depends on what games you play. Either way, you don't really need to install wine with your package manager.

If you only play steam games, just enable steam play and start playing supported titles.

Personally I just have steam and Lutris installed. Steam for steam games and Lutris for others.",linux_gaming
jgvpfug,"**Wine.** Wine is a software that runs Windows applications on other OS. To do this, it recreates the inner workings of Windows and simulates that environment, so that applications think they're on Windows. Kind of.

**Prefixes.** The directory in which it simulates that Windows environment is called the prefix. By default it's \~/.wine (hidden dir .wine in your home folder), though it's possible to set a different directory through an environment variable. Applications that help managing Wine easily (like Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, Steam to some extent) usually set a dedicated prefix for each Windows app/game installed. This has some advantages (it's easier to remove it later, it avoid conflicts with extra libraries and so on) and disadvantages (it takes more space). Using dedicated prefixes is a bit like having multiples PCs on which you'd install Windows and only one app/game on each.

Wine prefixes can be 32 or 64 bit simply because software can be 32 or 64 bit. It would be a bit long and technical to explain this, just consider that softwares made for older PC were 32 bit (and before that 16 bit, 8 bit...) and those made for newer PC are 64 bit. While there's compatibility to some extent when it comes to launch 32 bit apps on 64 bit systems, it's limited and on specific cases, Wine will need to setup a 32 bit prefix to manage a 32 bit app.

**Bottles.** Some apps that simplify the management of Wine use the term of bottle to call the prefix. Because wine (the beverage) is stored in bottles. Metaphor, yadda yadda. Bottles are just a different name for Wine prefixes (*or* for the the one application that is named *Bottles*, though the term originated in a different one).

**Steam.** Steam is a software made by Valve that is a games store and a client to launch games you buy on it. It's available on Windows, MacOS and Linux. In the past, to run Windows games from Steam, we had to run the Windows version of Steam itself, as there was no way to run Windows games from the Linux version of Steam (and obviously also before Steam was released for Linux at all). A few years ago, Valve added Wine inside Steam Linux under the name of Proton (or Steam Play, for the name of the feature ""run Windows games on Linux""). We can now run Windows games directly from Steam Linux without having to run Steam Windows through Wine. That's not the case on MacOS, where Proton doesn't exist and so people still have to run Steam Windows to play Windows games.

Proton GE is an unofficial version of Proton that adds some extra features. Usually it works the same as regular Proton except that it offers more possibilities (among them is the general support for some video formats that are added to regular Proton on a per-game basis). That's why a lot of people suggest to use it, though there are some cases where it'll have issues with some games.",linux_gaming

Vulkan is intended to offer higher performance and more efficient CPU and GPU usage compared to the older OpenGL and Direct3D 11 APIs. It does so by providing a considerably lower-level API for the application than the older APIs that more closely resembles how modern GPUs work.

Skatterbencher says that for the V-Cache CPUs the Fmax is something that can't be overwritten (Should be about 5.15GHz) because they're sensitive to high temps, so it might be the case that the V-Cache cores aren't something you can accurately and programmatically identify from the OS (at least on Linux).

Only other thing I would note is that using WINE\_CPU\_TOPOLOGY environment variable and setting that in your Steam Launch Options might be a better way of grouping since you can turn it on or off per-game.

I haven't really tried to restrict it to one CCD since the main thing I care about (stuttering) isn't really noticeable since I enabled GPL.

WINE\_CPU\_TOPOLOGY does look to be a different solution but wouldn't work for native Linux games (or native programs should I want them to run on the V-Cache cores). I'm only using the CPPC setting to prefer frequency cores so the scheduler will lean on the frequency cores for background tasks when I tell it to run a game on the V-Cache cores using taskset.

jgsm8ry,"Ah okay, i think I know why I was initially confused.

I originally followed this Linux guide for Star Citizen where it described a similar problem with trying to run the game on a Threadripper with multiple chiplets:

[https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki/Performance-Tuning#increased-performance-for-cpus-with-multiple-dies](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki/Performance-Tuning#increased-performance-for-cpus-with-multiple-dies)

Their instructions specify that the number what follows ""PU L#"" is what you want to specify when using WINE\_CPU\_TOPOLOGY to restrict the threads.  But from what you observed, the number below that in lstopo is what we actually want ""P#""

&#x200B;

From a practical standpoint, I think there's still lower hanging fruit just because I followed that initial pattern by stating ""WINE\_CPU\_TOPOLOGY=16:0,1,2,3,4,5,12,13,14,15,16,17"" which would have used the ""correct"" cores, but later on used ""WINE\_CPU\_TOPOLOGY=16:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15"", which would have bounced the threads between the two CCDs and is ""incorrect"".  But I also added in ""RADV\_PERFTEST=gpl"" and got much less stuttering when playing FF7 Remake.

&#x200B;

It's still useful information and I'll still play around with these settings.  This information is especially useful since I'm running stress-ng wrapped in a Bash script and I was doing the equivalent of CoreCycler, but based on what I read here I was going through the wrong CPU threads the whole time.

While I was able to launch the game and get the main menu to load, I had a few (major) issues along the way:

I was originally trying to launch the game with DXVK 1.10.3, because that's the last version with Vulkan 1.2 support (which is the last Vulkan version supported by official NVIDIA drivers for Kepler).

However, the current NVK implementation for Kepler seems to only implement Vulkan 1.0:

    $ wine gta_sa.exe
    info:  Game: gta_sa.exe
    info:  DXVK: v1.10.3-47-gb144ae28
    [...]
    WARNING: NVK is not a conformant Vulkan implementation, testing use only.
    warn:  Skipping Vulkan 1.0 adapter: GeForce GTX 660
    warn:  DXVK: No adapters found. Please check your device filter settings and Vulkan setup.

But that's no biggie, I was fairly certain that DXVK 1.5 (which supports Vulkan 1.0) could handle GTA SA just fine.

Well...

[Here's the current result.](https://i.imgur.com/mNxKGuK.png)

[And here's what happened after I tried to start a new game.](https://i.imgur.com/cEos8uR.png)

Yeah, that's pretty bad (as expected).

However, to me the *real* bad part about this is not NVK itself, but nouveau.

Nouveau (from the 6.1 kernel) is just very unstable with Kepler. *Very* unstable. Just by opening a text editor, or even a terminal window, I would trigger an entire system crash, which would require me to reboot the computer.

These two screenshots I just posted? They took me about 7 reboots to be able to take them. LOL

What's really unfortunate is that this has always been my experience with nouveau with this GPU. Ever since I first tried to daily-drive it, back in 2014...

So it just saddens me that, to this day, I can still experience irrecoverable lockups just by having an idling desktop environment... :/

But I still want both nouveau and NVK to succeed, so I guess it's time for me to do some investigation and bug reporting, even though in my point of view these crashes look very hard to properly reproduce...",linux_gaming

The problem with nouveau and power/clock speed limits is that the kernel driver part of nouveau was unable to do reclocking, because in order to change clock speeds, you need to load firmware signed by nvidia, and only the proprietary nvidia driver knows how to talk to this firmware.

See this for more information from someone more knowledgeable than me: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/cnpuss/nouveau_developer_explaining_how_exactly_nvidia/

jgs7h2m,"First of all welcome, glad you appear to be enjoying PoP_OS. I'll try to answer the questions that I believe I can help with.

>>How can I tune my GPU (AMD)? Fans? CPU (AMD)?

CoreCtrl is the best option, and appending amdgpu boot parameters is the only way to fully access overclocking on AMD with any software. It's not hard to do, but you should learn how to edit a text file from the terminal at least, so you can undo things if they cause boot issues.

>>how can I monitor my PC in more detail

Mangohud is a game overlay that can display all the information you'd ever want, and goverlay can configure it with a GUI, however I can't comment on goverlay's usefulness as I don't use it. For desktop/terminal applications amdgpu_top or radeontop are good. 

>>If my current Kernel doesn't have the drivers for some hardware (6.2.6), I think I would need a new Kernel version which has them

Correct. You can install additional kernels alongside your primary one without replacing it and select which one to boot to, so the chance of system breakage is pretty low. You'll have to configure a boot entry for the new kernel to appear in your bootloader, which is different for each bootloader, so this is somewhat complicated territory, but if you don't want to wait then it's your only choice short of switching to another distro that keeps its kernel more up to date.

>>How can I tune which Radeon features are turned on?

Gnome currently doesn't support Freesync on Wayland unless you install some unfinished bits of Gnome. If you're using X11 then you can enable it with a config tweak, however Freesync on X11 will not function at all if you have more than 1 monitor. See this page for the relevant information. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Variable_refresh_rate

>>If dual booting (damn you COD/Ricochet), install linux first, create an NTFS partition, and THEN install Windows there.

This is mostly a good practice, however be weary of Windows updates if your dual boot is sharing the same drive. Windows may attempt to overwrite your Linux bootloader with the Windows one during large updates, which messes everything up and you'll be forced to repair things with a bootable USB. If possible I'd strongly suggest keeping Linux and Windows on two separate drives, that way the install order shouldn't matter and they can have their own bootloaders.

>>If you want a similar experience to windows, install Steam and Discord from .deb, as flatpaks are sandboxed, and Discord is not able to spy on what games are running. 

Yes, stick to system packages over Flatpaks/Snaps/Appimages if you want consistent behavior. That said Flatpaks are a great way of getting software that isn't available in your distro's normal repositories.

As an additional thing I will mention that quite a few of your issues or missing features come from the Gnome desktop, and something like KDE Plasma would have freesync support out of the box, a volume mixer by default, clipboard manager, a task manager replacement with full system monitoring, and arguably a more friendly UI to a Windows user. Don't wanna already suggest you uproot to a new distro and desktop, but just laying info out there if you ever get curious.

jgs2n26,"Hi there, welcome to Linux! Let's see if I can answer some of your quests:

1. From what I know, you need that parameter to enable any overclock/undervolt/(fan curves?). Depending on your bootloader, it is just adding a kernel parameter.
2. btop is a great tool to monitor cpu/disks/network/processes. For GPU, you could look at [amdgpu\_top](https://github.com/Umio-Yasuno/amdgpu_top).
3. Can't help you with that, sorry.
4. Sadly can't help with that either as I'm not sure how Pop!\_Os does it all.
5. Freesync depends on DE/WM. As I can see you have gnome, which currently doesn't support VRR out of the box and needs a patched mutter for it (more info [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Variable_refresh_rate)).
6. It is generally recommended to first install Windows, then Linux as Windows tends to overwrite the boot partition.

It's based on Fedora, so an alternative is just to use normal Fedora's KDE spin if you'd rather do some things yourself and get a more default experience. Either of these would be my first recommendations for beginner friendly KDE distros.

A second option is OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, which is rolling release unlike Fedora or PoP. SUSE is known for offering a great KDE experience, however it also leans slightly to the less beginner friendly side of Linux distros. But it does have a unique tool called Yast that lets you configure more things via GUI than any other distro. A downside would be the lower popularity of it, so you'll find less info and guides for it.

The company can promise to fix bugs that only happens on the proton version or contribute with fixes or at least a bug report to Wine devs and/or a patch that can be applied on Proton-GE.

They also can go all the way with the effort of making sure the anti-cheat works since EAC officially supports Proton.

It's official if the company says so. Nothing else matters.

The ""windows-only"" game barrier is very blur now. It's honestly easier to just target a common runtime (e.g. Steam runtime + Windows/Proton) than to target two runtimes (Steam runtime on Windows and Steam runtime on Linux) - and that's not to say the differences if they use an in-house engine.

It's the same for Linux applications, it's better to just target one runtime than multiple and that's why Flatpak is popular right now.

I'm not sure, Tim has been on some kind of weird war path for quite some time.

As far as developing goes, the development is actually easier. There are distribution issues, caused by distro sprawl. Steam fixes that if you target the included runtime. 

You still get some distro to distro quirks, due to differences in release cadence. This is why Valve selected Arch to be their base for SteamOS 3 on the Steam deck and eventual desktop release of SteamOS. Latest versions of everything (especially Mesa and other video drivers)

Some developers point to ""more issues"" on linux but that's kinda a furphy as linux users are more likely to lodge bugs.

The last issue is Linux's pliability. Custom kernel drivers/Virtualization can make it harder to narrow down cheats. Oh and ld_preload to replace binaries (or custom versions of libaries) to get things inside the game memory space. 

All of the above is more of an inditement of the trusted client peer-to-peer networking models that are used in many games today than issues specifically with linux. Of course the outlay/server load of older client-server untrusted client models makes it a hard argument to have. 

Oh and the fact that Windows will let you lock shit down because Windows is actively hostile against its users. So moving to linux where the user is king and the software is just that, software can be jilting for developers.",linux_gaming

If the game doesn't crash and you're happy with the performance, you don't have to do these adjustments (the `PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1` makes Proton translate Direct3D to OpenGL rather than to Vulkan, so I'd assume the ICDs are not even used). I've played for weeks if not month like this and never had any reason to complain.

On the other hand, these days, Vulkan is supposed to be “better” than OpenGL in several ways (mostly performance), so if you find that performance is not as good as it should be, or if you face other glitches, you might want to try removing the `PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1` option and check the ICDs.",linux_gaming

Kde neon is kubuntu+ essentially, it’s based on Ubuntu lts and it removes things that people don’t like about Ubuntu like snaps. I wouldn’t recommend this over kubuntu though just because you will be gaming and it is based on lts so your kernel and drivers versions will be up to 2 years out of date.

Opensuse TW is it’s own thing, it’s rolling and is often faster than arch even in its release cycle. It however uses openQA to ensure stability and this approach works wonders. It is an incrsdibly stable distro for being rolling release. You will of course still find bugs, but an update should never break anything.

I really want to experiment with langchain, and combining models, as well as cross-training them together, but I can't do that atm.
* I absolutely refuse to run an Nvidia GPU. Their software stack on Linux...Kind of sucks. Like, it's really difficult to undervolt them effectively, and I refuse to run a 300+ watt GPU at stock.

If I did cave and get an Nvidia system, it would probably be an Orin AGX 64GB so that I could train models in the backround on battery, and run inference on my main PC, and even that would feel like a defeat.

Granted, I'm not 100% sold on actually pulling the trigger, but I really want to do it. Plus the Vitalis AI stack sounds pretty interesting, and I'd love to experiment with FPGAs down the line, at some point.

As for encode, that is mostly a problem for the gaming/streaming markets, less so for the professional/compute market which is where this card is targeting.

AMD does work well for compute, as long as it is written for their cards. This is evidenced by the number of top supercomputers that use AMD instinct CDNA cards.

Their ROCm offering keeps talking about heterogeneous compute, and they added some ""AI engine"" in their Ryzen 7000 laptop chips.

It seems to me that their strategy is not to beat CUDA by giving us killer features that Nvidia cannot deliver (it would be very difficult to catch up in terms of software + surpass in a meaningful way), instead they seem to be interested in having ambient AI stuff everywhere which is sufficient for inference, but keep the training on their specialized CDNA cards.

AMD recommends using their own custom kernel with extra patches. Performance isn't the best, at least with OpenCL (RustICL supposedly can outperform it for OpenCL Workloads). Running compute workloads alongside graphical sessions can cause the graphical sessions to lock up momentarily, making using a PC with ROCm running nearly impossible in some situations. (Also could have been related to running it on unsupported hardware).

They've been working on it for 5-6 years and this is the best they've got... Compare that to RustICL, which has been in development for... A year and a half total? by some graphics dev on RedHat, and it allows both Intel -and- AMD to run OpenCL apps (as of the most recent Mesa). Even better, it's mostly just Gallium, so it can run on top of Zink, so it can (in theory) also run on top of hardware that only has a Vulkan driver, and no Gallium driver.
On top of that, sounds like RustICL may even be aiming to support SYCL and/or HIP in the future too (https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-23.1-Adds-Rusticl-SPIR-V) which would make the entire ROCm stack somewhat irrelevant.

True, but at least one can see what files a package installed (eg `pacman -Qlq $package`) or in case of .tar.gz archives, simply by opening them. Even compiled software can be assessed by reading source code. Sure not everyone does it, but even a single person discovering something fishy is enough. Also, in case of software installed through distro repos, I don't see why one should distrust the distro maintainer when one is already using the distro. Most of the packages and almost all packages a novice user will use are in distro's repos so they are protected (and files can be verified anyhow if necessary).

So situation in linux is in no way similar to windows as far as I can see. There is no way to check for files modified before or even after the installation in windows, unless someone tracks changes made to all files (or at least important files) post install.

Most of this is wrong.

This is an x86_64 based Chromebook. So the first issue is that MTG:A is an ARM only binary on the app Store. Which is why it's not compatible with OPs Chromebook.

Secondly, they use containers for Linux on ChromeOS not VMs, there is a considerable difference between VMs and containers. Now the container doesn't have access to hardware acceleration but that's true for entirely different reasons.

Lastly the PC version isn't actually that demanding. I have it running on a 2014 Mac Book just fine. It also runs on my son's old ass Lenovo ThinkPad. Both have Intel graphics. (everybody who complains about Arena performance usually have huge ass pings to the Arena servers)

I already clarified this part before you said anything:

> > I'm just saying they have to have actually launched the game. (or **tried to, since some games are so broken you can't even start them**)

i.e. the player had the **intention** to play the game but for one reason or another it wasn't possible or inadvisable, like the game being broken, containing malware, etc.

Then making a review and saying problems they found about the game are absolutely valid.

If they also say something about gameplay though I wouldn't call that portion valid since they didn't play the game.

If you mean using Nexus' Mod Manager, [SteamTinkerLaunch](https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch) handles installing Vortex through Proton. So you could always just use that as you already are used to.

If you're talking about general mod managers *made for Linux,* there is none--at least, any that supports more than Skyrim for instance; and even then, Nexus stuff is made with MO2, NMM and/or Vortex in mind anyways.

Btw, if you aren't sure if a game is running modded, you should check if whatever the modor loader is has some kind of logging or debug support; if it outputs any kind of status log, then it's being used. Proton is *usually* pretty good about auto-loading libraries, including those used as hook mechanisms to enable mods. But if you're using Wine over Lutris, or just want to be sure: if your game uses a .dll as a hooking/mod loading mechanism, use `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=""libraryname=n,b""` as an environment variable for your game's launch command - obviously replacing ""libraryname"" with the filename of whatever dll is used for modding, minus the "".dll"" extension. You can force-load multiple libraries if needed as a comma-seperated list, i.e. `=""libraryname1,libraryname2=n,b""`.

(I guess since you mentioned being new: if this is your first time messing with command line args in Steam for Linux, you put environment variables at the start, followed by `%command%`, then optionally followed by any launch argument switches that a game supports. Ex: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=""wsock32=n,b"" %command% -skip_intro`)

*ALSO* if a mod has some kind of external dependency, like if it specifically mentions needing VisualC or .NET Runtime, [Protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) will be a lifesaver for installing these into Proton prefixes.

So, no deb installed manually here.

You can install a newer version of a deb to upgrade one that's already installed (like the one you have, it's a deb package from the Ubuntu repos) as long as it's packaged in the same way. No need to remove the existing version beforehand.

In theory, download the deb, double-click on it and it should open with the Software Manager and offer you to update it.

In practice, the Ubuntu Software Manager is pretty bad, so I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work to install debs for some reason. Alternatively, you can also install/upgrade a package in command line.

Download the 0.5.12 release on GitHub as a deb from the link I posted before. Assuming it's in you Downloads dir (\~/Downloads), you can use the following commands. If it's in a different dir or has a different name, adapt the first command.

    sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/lutris_0.5.12_all.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f

dpkg is the package manager used on Debian/Ubuntu. APT (that manages packages from the repos through the command apt or apt-get) uses dpkg to manipulate packages.

The first command will use dpkg to install (-i) the package lutris\_0.5.12\_all.deb that's in \~/Downloads. sudo is needed as you need admin rights to manipulate the packages installed in the system.

Unlike APT, dpkg doesn't handle dependencies, so we use the second command to fix broken dependencies: if the deb installed by dpkg needed new dependencies, that command will install them (or remove the package if they can't be installed). In the case of Lutris, it's likely that it won't need new dependencies that are not already installed by your 0.5.9 version, in which case that second command will do nothing. The command is used just in case there are some when you install a deb, it's highly recommended to run it in that case.",linux_gaming

jgj7k7m,"By writing in this sub, it would appear that playing games is your priority. Many windows games work well in Linux and a handful even work better in Linux, but it shouldn't be a surprise that on average, windows games tend to work better on windows.

If playing windows games isn't your top priority, Linux does a passable job of running windows games and it also does virtually everything else better, IMHO.

While Linux is Linux, is Linux, not all of the defaults for each distro will suit everyone, or their hardware. Therefore, if you had a bad experience with one distro, there are literally hundreds of others to try. Once you have the necessary experience, the distro won't matter, because you  will have the skills to configure your environment the way that you (and your hardware) like it.",linux_gaming
jgj6gx9,"As long as you use nvidia-dkms you shouldn't have much problems with other kernels, install the kernels and their headers and let dkms handle the rest.

Not sure what your drive worries are but a root drive of 450gb is massively over specced, even 50gb should be more than enough. Not sure what you do on root that would fill those 450gb. You don't install games via package manger that dumps them in /opt/ or /usr/bin. You are free to setup Steam libraries for your games on other drives. If everything fails you can use symlinks to redirect data to another location.

But yes if you are used to Windows you'll have to ""battle"" and get used to how stuff works. If you have a problem there are more than enough resources out there, archwiki & reddit are a big help. It's the same when I have to help troubleshoot some problem on my buddies Windows gaming laptop, I'll sit there clicking through menus like a deer in headlights and have to start googling shit.

If Garuda and Manjaro were not a good experience for you try a different based OS. Both of those are arch with rolling updates. I believe pop os and Ubuntu are debian, which might be a little more stable for your uses.

Nvidia GPU  + 2 monitors with different refresh rate is problematic in Linux because Nvidia does not want you to move to Linux. Simple as that. You bought Nvidia ( a company that hates Linux) and then want to move to Linux. Next time vote with your wallet.

The ""windows lets me install wherever I want"" is not a problem for linux. You can use symlinks if you manage to somehow use all the root capacity. Also you setup steam's game library to a 3rd HDD/SSD.

It's not linux fault if your keyboard doesn't lit up from BIOS and needs windows only drivers to work. This means you bought a windows-only-depended-from-drivers keyboard. Tell us which keyboard it is and we may help. If it is rgb, most of them can be set from  openRGB.

I needed to tell us a reason so If it wasn't mandatory I could answer to him ""stick with windows"". Gamers with nvidia graphics (a company that hates Linux and will never properly support linux neither will they open source their drivers so the community can fix the problems) come to Linux, then spam the forums asking for help, which give to Linux a bad reputation as a ""beta"" OS while it is purely Nvidia's fault. People that are serious about Linux DON'T buy Nvidia hardware. Simple as that.

Now, if the switch was mandatory I would guide him to use symlinks if he somehow managed to use all his ""450 GB"" ssd and also tell him to setup steam so the game library is installed to a ""games"" drive.

For 144Hz gaming I would recommend physically turning off the 2nd monitor and then setting the 1st properly while gaming.

I think all of the above are easy fixes.

Usually badly ported console games, some emulators, etc. To some extent it's which frame limiter you use as well (`mangohud` works well in most games but not in others and the `gamescope` implementation introduces input lag). And the implementations within games vary in quality.

Mailbox is a nice option, but at the expense of higher resource usage/power/noise. Also, if you're getting frames high enough that you can benefit from mailbox, you probably don't need it (as you can just cap at the refresh rate or slightly below and be done with it).

jg9u23q,"Welcome to the Linux community!

1. At this point the major hurdle with gaming is AntiCheat; Some games deliberately don't work on Linux.  I tend to play single-player small studio or independent games like Subnautica, Satisfactory etc. and it just hasn't been a problem, Go for the big greed machines like EA, Bethesda and Microsoft and you might run into more issues.  You mention the Steam Deck; if it runs on your Steam Deck it'll almost certainly run on an x86 Linux desktop.
2. I personally use Linux Mint.  The biggest ""tweak"" I've had to do is...I had to manually reassign my motherboard's audio jacks to attach my 5.1 surround sound system which took installing some little utility, then...the amp in this system is pretty hot, so every time the audio turns on and off there was a loud pop.  So I had to change an N to a Y and a 0 to a 1 to get it to just leave the audio on.  Otherwise most stuff I've done is just through the settings menus.
3. I typically recommend against Ubuntu as a home distro these days; just about everything they do seems wrong-headed for the end user desktop.  But it's one of the ones you'll likely see in the professional space, the other major one being Red Hat.  I probably would recommend against the Gnome desktop in favor of...literally anything, I personally would rather have no GUI at all and do everything in Bash than be stuck with Gnome, but that's what all the personal preference we have is for.
4. I strongly recommend keeping a Windows instance installed on real hardware, either via dual boot or a separate machine if practicable.  Because you WILL hit those moments where you could get this done in 4 seconds in Windows but you're 10 minutes into trying to figure out what it's even called in Linux and I just need to get this turned in my boss is waiting.  Resist the brain explosion.  Boot into Windows, do the job, turn it in, boot back into Linux, and now try to do the job.  Your brain won't be wasting neurons on the ""There's a deadline hurry up asshole"" part, freeing your attention for learning.  Eventually, you'll stop booting to Windows.  Took about three years for me, and if it weren't for Fusion360 I could have completely abandoned Windows at that point.  ie don't burn that bridge until you absolutely don't need anything on the other side of them.",linux_gaming
jg9ju3z,"As far as gaming goes, I've been using only Linux for 5 years now. The only games I could not get to work were:

- Sometimes LoL when they break their launcher again

2.  Tweaks shouldn't be necessary.  Choice of distribution is important.  Choose a solid, well supported distribution and you don't need tweaks.  

3.  Ubuntu is a great first choice.  The only other I'd recommend is Fedora.  You said you need to learn it for work, there's 2 main Linux camps, Debian/Ubuntu based and Red Hat (includes Fedora)/SUSE based...  Or .deb packages versus .rpm packages.

jg9xrbp,"Just going to address #3 quickly.

I've been using Ubuntu pretty much exclusively for 14 years or so? It's a solid distribution. I used to distro-hop and experiment, but I don't think I've used anything than Ubuntu or SteamOS (Steam Deck) in coming up on ten years.

Having said all that, I think Ubuntu isn't the #1 distribution it once was. You might want to look at Linux Mint and Pop OS. It's great to be able to distro-hop when you are first experiencing Linux, since there is such a great variety out there. Linux is more a family of OSes built on a common kernel. The desktop paradigm can be surprisingly different. Different window managers, different desktop environments, etc.

You'll find that there is surprising variety around even GUI file managers. The terminal is near universal however. 

Whatever you end up doing, distro-hopping, Ubuntu, something else, put effort into getting comfortable in the terminal. Even if you don't need to use the removal for work, just some basic familiarity with the terminal is a useful life skill if you work around computers even a little bit. Heck, I remember using the terminal the last time I had to help someone with a Mac. Mac's are Unix with a flashy environment.",linux_gaming
jg9hq7z,"1. Yes, gaming has gotten really good with the advances in proton and we have some nice tools such as MangoHud, Corectrl, Gamescope and the list goes on. I really enjoy gaming on Linux. 
2. Problems? If you are installing games on Steam, not many. Sometimes with older titles or installing through Lutris I might have to tweak a little. I am sure the experience is very similar to the Steam Deck in that regard.
3. Ubuntu is definitely solid. Another good option which I prefer is Linux Mint due to the lack of Snaps and the team behind it. The advantage with Mint is that it shares many of the same internals as Ubuntu which means any guides/troubleshooting are pretty much the same.

I think you should take a look at Nobara Linux. Not because I personally use it but because it suits your usecase, assuming that gaming is your primary concern and office work is secondary (since you are posting on linux gaming subreddit)

The guy who created it ([Glorious Eggroll](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll)) is responsible for creating Proton, the software that enables Windows games to run flawlessly on the Steam Deck. From personal experience I can tell that the heavily customised OS that he distributes has managed to run practically every game that I have thrown at it on the first try. This is a revelation for me since half my games didnt work on my previous OS because

a) I have a Nvidia card 

b) though not terminal-shy, I wouldnt know how to make the tweaks/customisations necessary to make a misbehaving game run properly. 

I would recommend using the KDE version of the OS, since it resembles a windows interface and has tons of customisation options for you to tweak to your heart's delight.

1) Yes, it's in a good state IMO.  I picked up a few AAA items from my Steam library (FF7 Remake, FFXV, Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, Mass Effect Legendary Edition ME3, Trails of Cold Steel 4) and they all play.  The only exception I've found thus far is Atelier Ryza 3 which was released less than a month ago.  Approach might need to change on purchases (e.g. wait for ""Gold"" or better in ProtonDB before purchasing, and maybe accept that some games might never be playable).  It's honestly surprising and much further ahead than I thought it would be.

2) Not often.  I use LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office, I can use SVP with MVP as a media player instead of MKV or VLC.  I switched from the Outlook application to using web browser for emails.  I don't use any other productivity app like Photoshop or anything Adobe.  The biggest hiccup I've run into is that I run AMD and can't use Ryzen Master or CoreCycler to tune my OC (via Curve Optimizer).  I also genuinely can't find accurate logs in MCE to tell me which core was responsible when I push the offset too far.  That might be one scenario where I was looking to just dual boot into Windows for those things.

3) Pop!\_OS is what the Wiki recommends.  I'm comfortable enough with my own troubleshooting skills (less than 1 year exp with Linux, and only ever in the Cloud and not on actual hardware) to start with vanilla Arch Linux.

At most, you will have to install gamemode and put `gamemoderun %command%` in the steam launch options.

That being said, I was able to play the Diablo 4 beta with everyone else using Lutris! I also played Warhammer 40k Darktide with issues *after* some fixes.

2. Those tweaks are fun sometimes! Most of the time my use cases, I haven't had to tweak much outside of Darktide during the teething period of that game. I mainly play Guild Wars 2 right now, but I also play Warframe, FFXIV, Path of Exile, and some other ones, none of those required any tweaking. I run GW2 through Lutris and I used the Arch User Repository (AUR) to install a launcher for FFXIV. The rest are through Steam.

3. Ubuntu is a good choice, though with my experience with pop!_os, I tend to recommend the latter for the platform switching experience. It has active development (not saying Ubuntu doesn't, but I don't know how much activity Ubuntu has gotten lately), and seems to be more focused on gaming (citation needed).

2. So far, the only thing I played on my system (Debian) since I moved to Linux was Fallout New Vegas. No tweaks needed. Regarding non-games, I've used the native version of those applications and, most of the time, I had no issues. The only exception I can remember was when I had to fix Opera's capability of playing videos. I recommend using flatpak to install apps, at least when possible; it solves the issue of conflicting libs that used to be a hassle on Linux in the past (technically snap and AppImages do the same; flatpak is simply my personal preference).
3. Like I've mentioned before, I've picked Debian. I've actually used Ubuntu first, but then migrated to Debian after a while. You will notice that multiple people will recommend different systems. The fact is: the community can't agree on which Linux system is the best entry system. Ubuntu is the most well known system with the most criticized company, Pop\_OS is known for being better at gaming but can be more unstable due to early adoption of new things, Debian (stable) guarantees your system won't break out of nowhere at the cost of taking way longer to receive new features, and the list goes on.

About the tinkering, I don't know if anybody already say this but:
In Linux when your learn something it will be applicable for more than one specific case, you will learn usable things not just tweaks. And the basics for gaming ain't so hard to learn.

If you have a Deck, for sure you have learn many basics already, with the differences of a desktop distro, which are more ""complex"" because you can do more things in multiple ways (sometimes is overwhelming how many things you can actually do).

When you really need to start doing tweaks it's generally not the games themselves but when it comes to modding. There's simple stuff like having to add some argument or whatever like `DLLOVERRIDES`

However a lot of games with lots of modding like Skyrim and what have you will have 3rd party Mod Managers, and they can be a pain.

For me it was too much of a bother so I just went with the old fashioned way and manually installed mods along with a symlink. Though there should be some guide for running whatever Skyrim mod manager on Linux by now I think.

&nbsp;

But I could not get Frosty (mod manager for Frostbite Engine games) to work for Dragon Age Inqusition and last I checked it's a huge pain to get to work.

Every time you add a mod to the modlist Frosty wants to create symlinks, but the catch is if requires an NTFS drive.

I don't understand, can you explain this further? It's against point 2.

1. Been playing in linux for 5 months and have no real issues. Don't forget to use Feral Gamemode for every game (because it boosts your performance by a lot). Read carefully the protondb page for any game you have bad performance and try to find reviews of people with the most similar rig, like nvidia users.
2. It depends on the type of distro you choose, but it's not a big thing anymore. Maybe you will encounter some issues like audio or fonts, but there is plenty of info out there about it.
3. I don't recommend Ubuntu because they're making some weird decissions and there is already better distros in my opinion. Try not to use any ""rolling release"" distros for now because they require a bit more maintaining than other options. Distros are simply a ""pack"" of a desktop environment (DE), package manager and some tweaks. Choose any DE similar than windows like KDE (Fedora, Kubuntu uses KDE). Some folks here recommends Fedora but I haven't tried it. 
4. Windows VM has very poor performance unless you do some big tweaks or directly GPU passthrough black magic... Try dual booting linux and windows first. This way you will get used to linux without having to worry too much about work. Then, when you find all replacements or use Wine make the switch and maybe make a VM.

jgc5hjz,"Gaming on Linux needs some more steps to set up than on windows but when finished it usually is better then on windows, so here is what i recommend:

1. Install wine, winetricks, protontricks, protonplus, q4wine and protonup-qt (having all of them is not necessary but i have them just to be safe and be able to either change or look up specific things like the pfx ID for steam and to install proton/wine versions easier)
2. Install Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris and Bottles (Steam is a given, Lutris is an all aroung Launcher where you use scripts made by individuals to install games, usually works great, Heroic is basically steam but for epic and gog only and bottles is similiar to lutris it just does it differently on a technical level)
3. Install mangohud, gamemode, vkbasalt, gamescope, vkd3d/vkd3d-proton, dxvk and goverlay (Mangohud is a great FPS overlay that also gives you more information like gpu/cpu temp and your current resolution (this is great if you use Proton-GE and its upscaling feature), gamemode is basically power mode for linux but only during gaming, vkbasalt enhaces graphics and can also be used for reshades, gamescope forces a game into a specific resolution while the windows is forced into a different (great if you use a tiling window manager and the games has problems running), vkd3d/vkd3d-proton and dxvk are just there to improve directx 8,9,10,11,12 games by providing more dlls and apis and goverlay allows you to customize mangohud and vkbasalt)
4. Anti-Cheat is annoying (kinda), if the game has a kernel-level anti-cheat it can work if ts easy-anti-cheat or battle-eye and only as long as it is not required for the game to even start, example: Elden Ring has easy-anti-cheat, but it is not required for the game to work, just for the multiplayer, so if you install the easy-anti-cheat runtime on steam and run elden ring with proton its gonna work and you can even play multiplayer, other games like Black Desert who need the kernel-level anti-cheat to be running wont work even with the runtime.

-----------------------------------------------

As one who started dabbling with Linux on the side in 2018, still keeping macOS my main ""podcasting OS"" and Windows my main ""gaming OS"" (the two sharing ""general internet derping"" duties about equally, and with comparable enjoyment), then became ""Linux-primary"" in 2020, moving Windows and Mac off to the side and seldom used, but still keeping them, who then later got rid of all traces of Windows on my personal devices in late 2021 or early 2022, and then finally became ""Linux-exclusive"" just a few months ago after finally finishing the outstanding podcast project on Mac that had prevented me from wiping it much sooner, and as one who has no intentions of going back, thinks Linux is amazing, and has several different distros installed on several different physical devices, here's what I would say to you and your situation.....

......I'm super happy to hear about your budding interest and passion for Linux, and would love to have you join the Linuxverse. BUT, I actually do not recommend switching ""cold turkey"". If you do, and then run into a major difficulty, then it could sour you on it and send you packing back to Windows. Instead, what I advise is that you (for now) keep Windows in the capacity that you already have it, and since you have the Steam Deck, hook it to a dock at a computer desk and/or TV, and use desktop mode frequently - for more and more stuff, as much as you can. Also, since SteamOS desktop mode uses the KDE desktop environment, which is one of the most, if not even THE most customizable, flexible Linux DE (and my personal favorite - four of my eight current installs are using it), start dicking around with customizing it and making it your own. If you do any creative work, such as music or art or podcasting or streaming, try to start doing that more and more on the Deck. I've done podcast episodes from the Deck before! It's great!

As you do this, you will become more and more comfortable, familiar, and confident with it, and I am confident that it will gradually morph more and more into your main thing. When you feel this happening, shrink (but don't erase) your Windows partition on your main device, and install Linux alongside. And then, when you feel like it, eventually wipe the Windows partition and stretch the Linux partition to be the whole thing, as well as perhaps a nifty metaphor for your computing life in general.

On the one hand, I would encourage virtually EVERYONE to try Linux, in the hopes that many will fall in love with it and make it their own. On the other hand, there are two kinds of people that I make a deliberate, conscious effort NEVER to become: a) the ones who say [in effect] ""Linux is the only acceptable OS and only idiots and perverts disagree"", or b) ""ooh, you're interested in Linux? Then you have to cold-turkey all other OSes and go completely Linux RIGHT NOW!"" ""DO IT DO IT DOOOOOO IIIIIIIIIT!""

As I said, I came into Linux in 2018. It would've certainly been even sooner...except I kept running into people like one or both of the above (particularly the latter, who frequently insinuated that I was either dumb, and/or a chicken shit if I didn't take their advice), and they left such a profoundly bad taste in my mouth that I would just ""nope out"" and go back to my Mac. I think slow and steady (well, gradual and measured) wins the race here. So, get to the business of easing into it, and hopefully you'll agree that this is the best place in all of PCdom! And best of all, in the Steam Deck, you already have basically the perfect device from which to do this! It's an amazing little thing, isn't it? (even if it's not really all that little!) ;-)

All the best, and I hope to see you around Penguinland!

p.s. I did see your question about distros, but with as long-winded as this got, I'll just skim this otherwise vast topic. For now, I'll just say my main distro all the way up til just a few weeks ago was Ubuntu Studio (it was even the central distro back in my ""dabble days""). The greater ""Ubuntuverse"" (especially things like Linux Mint or one of the ""official flavors"" of Ubuntu) is a great, safe, cozy, happy (even if somewhat boring) place to start. I think most of the really cool, hot stuff is happening in the world of Arch (SteamOS is based on Arch, BTW), and it seems like it's where [so to speak] ""all the cool kids are going"". And then there are other great places too, like the greater worlds of Red Hat-based distros (like Fedora and openSUSE), or even Debian. Now, I know Ubuntu itself is based on Debian, but when most people say ""Debian"", the subtext is usually understood to mean ""non-Ubuntu Debian"", and unless otherwise obvious from context, that's how I'm always going to mean it. Of my eight current distros, three are Arch-based (Garuda, Manjaro, and SteamOS), two are Ububtu-based (KDE Neon and Elementary OS), two are Red Hat-based (Fedora and openSUSE), and one is Debian-based (MX Linux). In ordinary circumstances, I'd typically advise you to start with Mint or Ubuntu and begin exploring outside of that once you get the hang of it. But since you're already in Arch via the Deck, in your particular case, I say just start exploring from there. :-)",linux_gaming

Using linux since 2003 time to time until i met Ubuntu and Then switched to Manjaro as my sole OS, I will share some experiences so your transition will be less hard. Distros i used Slackware Debian Mandrake Mandriva Pardus Ubuntu Manjaro

1. Go for Dual-Boot or windows installed to another disk so you can boot windows and use it for neccesary things  ( e.g. games may needs some fix workarounds to become playable again under linux.) until you feel its ok to go Linux only.
2. Try to understand Linux concept as first step its moduler OS  you can install 3 mainframe plus  7 forked desktop system on any Linux distro you want. So You do less ""distro hop"",  its community driven mostly then some company backed distros are exists so you can have premium support for distro. (RedHat, Suse(Novell) ,Gelecek(Gelecek A.Ş.) Magei)
3. Prepare for reading and asking some help in internet of course as a daily driver  everything mostly will go smooth easy with mouse clicks but when u start love Linux u will regret your past.  And then u will start doing or trying to do everything in your Linux. Most of time u will need console commands cus its Universal among distros.  So prepare for reading and asking for help also dont forget to help others while u can.
4. I prefer **Manjaro Linux with KDE Plasma** desktop cuz its rolling release distro so updates frequently and u dont need to reinstall new version of specific distro. İt just installed via updates and upgrades.  Also Manjaro almost install applications from source packages. As it downloads unpacks compiles installs.  so applications becomes very suitable and optimised for your hardware as Cpu to gpu and ram this brings huge performance.

KDE plasma for more traditional desktop experience as it has basic layout enough to do daily stuff. Yet its so customisable you can make any layout as you wish with plasmoids panels and lots of desktop animations if you will. Also package testing by community going very well so its less problematic distro between updates. Even its better than ubuntu updates.  İ couldn't break my Manjaro yet.

 Btw Steam OS+ SteamDeck now based on Arch as Manjaro so more compability between SteamDeck and Manjaro.  Also Manjaro has very active developpers on forums large community also being able to compile from source makes this distro ready to go with any new software while others like ubuntu have to wait for deb packages to be compiled and published. Also manjaro is less bloated. Even tho u can use minimal iso to install bare Manjaro KDE.",linux_gaming

Want to play rdr2 on max settings and 200fps? Bingo.. that's the distro for you...
Cyberpunk on epic settings? Yep.. does that too (minus dlss 3.. but it's sooooo smooth, I don't even need it)


I'm running it with a 4090/i9 combo and it's rock solid. (Tried both the official and the kde one.. I seem to like the kde interface a tiiiiiiny but more because it's really a clone off the steam deck.)

To me the trick to settle down is to not get too hung up on some small detail that might not work like you want and look at the big picture. When you are used to Windows you get used to a lot of it's problem and limitation so why wouldn't you do the same for Linux?

There are some hurdles but for a normal desktop user they are non existent. You just install it and use it like you would with Windows. You have alternatives to almost any windows counterpart in terms of software. As someone said above, anti-cheat is a problem, modding games can be too, however 95% titles work out of the box. Ubuntu comes with Nvdia XServer, so you are covered there. Don't use XOrg.X on NVDIA card , I have RTX 3070 and it's a smooth sail.

You feel like you are actually using your computer hacker style when you type these weird commands to Terminal. It's fine. I am total Linux Noob and I wouldn't come back to Windows if they paid me. I don't know what it is, but seeing shit like RAM usage, CPU usage and just snappiness in comaprison to Win 11 is just great.  


The bad stuff is hardware compatibility. There is no nice way to put it, but it's a mixed bag. I had a corsair mouse that just refused to work without some open software of an absolute angel on github. SO Every time i resintalled OS. (Yup, you will check all the distributions, curiosity is not gonna let you stay on UBUNTU) my mouse wouldn't work. I have second one from Corsair too and that one works fine. If you decide to jump do what other guy said. Do yourself a favour and keep small installation on Windows on your other drive or partition. It will keep you sane.  


So far i rate my Linux experience 10/10. I am currently on Pop!\_OS distribution and it's a smooth sail. I wouldn't jump on some obscure, distribution unless you know what you doing. For starters go with UBUNTU 22.10 check this one out, break it couple of times then jump on other one.

And that handled whatever I threw at it! But I wanted a more ""traditional"" experience, so I started playing around with Pop,  and then Mint, and a bunch of other distributions (Ubuntu Unity, even). 

But the funny thing with Mint, is despite offering both MATE and Cinnamon distros, they break each other. I found threads from googling about it.  And part of it that I can surmise is Mint has such a stilted build from wanting to be ""open source Windows 7 alternative"" that you have one program to find software, another to update, synaptic (OK, synaptic DOES make things simple though) etc.... there's a lot that can go wrong by treating the user simply, particularly by overcomplicating the use case. It seems like the display manager gets weighted down by memory management issues in Mint when you start adding more than the expected amount of environments to it. I even set restore points in TimeShift to try to figure out where I was going wrong. It's plainly just how the OS operates.

Flatpak Warning 

- If your steam install is done using Flatpak  that can result in the steam program being sandboxed and limited in what it can access. I have no experience with how this limits things, the **flatseal** tool may be needed to manage the flatpak steam program.  You can setup the specific flatpak to have access to other filesystems and mountpoints outside of your home. 

the command `flatpak list`

  should show if you have steam installed via flatpak or not.

Flatpak notes at the end..

----

I have NO idea how the steam SNAP version differs in how it can access other locations either.   

----

Continueing with the normal guide now..  

------

Steam Game Directory on NTFS (fat32/exfat/vfat)

1. **don't use the file manager to mount the filesystem**
2. setup a  `/etc/fstab`   line to mount it at boot time
3. you do NOT (typically) use chown or chmod on  a mounted NTFS. (you do use those commands  with ext4)


example fstab entry.

------

            UUID=1234-your-uuid-56789 /media/gamedisk ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,user,exec,nofail,umask=000 0 0 

**You Do NOT use  all of  those options for ext4**  

------

On Ubuntu you can use 'ntfs' instead of ntfs-3g  for the filesystem in the fstab options if you have ntfs-3g installed , it auto changes  NTFS to be ntfs-3g. Other distribution may differ.  When ntfs3 gets more commonplace, and stable likely people will switch to using ntfs3, and drop ntfs-3g

Newer Distribution and kernels may use the `ntfs3` driver, I have not tested that driver.  Try it out and see if it works. 

The various issues and problems with ntfs getting mounted Read Only still apply.  (hit up the numerous NTFS  under Linux guides for more information)  These issues also apply to exfat,vfat, fat32, and I imagine using ntfs3.  Disable windows hibernate/suspend and fast boot if sharing a filesystem between linux and windows.


And ..

it's best to not use ntfs for your game storage drive , it can be  slower and more of a CPU load.  It does Work for me, but it is slower in my experience.

also.. there are a lot of bad/wrong/old  posts/blogs/guides  on this topic. so watch out for those.  (some of the info here may be wrong, so dont trust this guide 100%)

 This guide may be outdated or wrong when we start using ntfs3.



Also be sure to check out this guide, and the part about the compatdata directory

--------

bonus tip.   **Steam scale ui Tweak.:**

set a system variable to have steam scale up it's UI.

             $    GDK_SCALE=2  steam

edit your steam .desktop file to make it the default option, or make a second .desktop file for a steam 2x Launcher.


--------

STEAM on an ext4 or other Linux filesystem.

basic outline..

format the Filesystem, get the UUID
make directory for the mount  

           mkdir /home/bob/games 
 
make fstab entry. 

      UUID=123-YOUR-UUID /home/bob/games ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0

mount the filesystem  

          sudo mount /home/bob/games 


make the Filesystem owned by your user.  

         sudo chown bob.bob /home/bob/games 


reboot to make sure it mounts.

use steam and tell it to put a steam library on /home/bob/games
install games as normal.

------------------

**ntfs3 notes**

from user mandiblesarecute who gives an example with ntfs3

      PARTLABEL=Win10     /media/win10    ntfs3   noacsrules,noatime,nofail,prealloc,sparse                                       0 0

 noacsrules **makes everything effectively 777** for when you don't need or care about fine grained access control. 
 
This 777 mode can be annoying and a security issue  in some use cases which is why it's not the default.

I had issues using  `Ntfs3`, so  for now I still use `Ntfs-3g `, i will test out ntfs3 again in the future as it matures. 


------

**Steam flatpak notes from another user. TimRambo1**

For flatpaks  you want to  use the **flatseal** tool to allow access to the filesystem mountpoint of your steam games filesystem.

example: add  mount point 
**/home/(username)/games/**

 under **filesystem** under the steam settings in **flatseal**. 

The filesystem still has to be properly mounted (as shown above)

jgdvc0j,"while I understand the potential issues with NTFS drivers on linux, the current issue is happening only with majority - but not all - steam games. Standalone games or games in Heroic works without any issue. So I'd presume the Steam is the source of the problem, not NTFS itself (at least not yet / not here / not directly).

\- therefore, probably no issue with the read-write.

\- mounting from 'disks' seems to have same results

\- ""nearly sure"" it was working well some time after tumbleweed installation. Are there any non-ntfs reasons for such behaviour? (especially given it is not 100% consistent)

\- any way to actually get any error log from failed run attempt?

I don't have the space to reformat the drive, but probably will buy the 4tb ssd (already in basket) to use on both system with maybe exfat or similar...

We have to different scenarios:

B: You have one computer, dual booting Linux and Windows with one single internal hdd.​ To have a common storage, you make an extra partition on the same disk. You can unmount it from windows or linux without expecting any interference with the running OS.

Yes. All drives add storage. This is what a drive is.

>On which bus the drive is connected and where the drive is physically located is completely irrelevant when talking about software issues.

No it isn't. Internal drives can have any filesystem because it is possible to install any driver on all operating systems used on the computer. External drives may be plugged in to other computers on which it is not possible (for a variety of reasons) to install missing filesystem drivers, and thus require using the most compatible ones.

In other words: btrfs is best in situations where drivers can be installed on all operating systems installed on the computer the drive is plugged in (i.e. when the drive is internal and will never be moved to another computer on a regular basis). exFAT or NTFS are best in situations where drivers cannot be installed on computers the drive will be plugged in (i.e. when the drive is external and will move between random computers on a regular basis).",linux_gaming

There is room for the Deck, because it shares a gamelibrary with your PC. Buy once play anywhere. MS Promised that with Xbox and Windows, but to my knowledge that's pretty limited.

The deck is a huge success because you pay 400 bucks to play the hundreds of games you bought already. If you had to buy all your games again for 60 bucks a pop, it would be MUCH less usefull. It's the same reason the switch works. It's one console for all you Nintendo games, designed to be played on TV AND on the go. No paying twice or some crapy ""mobile"" port of a game you like, that plays totally differently.

The Xbox arm of Microsoft is pretty decent at playing the long game. Always online was controversial for the Xbox One so they dropped it then only to bring it back with GamePass and Xcloud. With much praise I may add. They are buying up game studios to bolster their first-party games against Nintendo and Sony and are, for the time, open to taking money from PlayStation and Switch owners. They could change that in the future though. They are currently open to the Steam Deck and having games run under WINE/Proton because it is popular and not controversial. They’ll happily take money from Steam Deck users but the real money is data collection which SteamOS and Linux in general is not helping them with.

The one time they allowed that to happen, they lost the entire smartphone and tablet market, a mistake which I recall once even Bill Gates saying he viewed as the biggest mistake Microsoft ever made, not getting in there sooner and obtaining a stranglehold on it faster.

So yeah, Microsoft likes to act on things early, squish them when they're still small and non-threatening, before they get any bigger. I have no doubt someone at Microsoft said, 'Yes it's not a threat now, but it would be if this kept going, lets start fending this off now'.",linux_gaming

The best Linux distros for gaming will most likely be Endeavour OS and Fedora, as they typically have the very latest and greatest software.

I chose the Endeavour OS route and never regretted it. The AUR is amazing.

Get a virtual machine software like Gnome Boxes or Virt Manager (uses QEMU) as it supports KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) which is a technology that's baked into the Linux kernel. This allows for near native CPU performance and cool tricks like GPU passthrough.  Most guides that I read during that time suggested QEMU-based software.

Regarding games installed in Windows, if they are on an NTFS drive Steam won't play nice - they need to be on a filesystem that supports symlinks, as that's how Steam puts together the proton containers. There are some workarounds, but I just keep separate libraries for Linux and the very few games I absolutely have to run on Windows. You can copy the files for the games over to your Linux installation directory instead of re-downloading though.

I've used Debian based distros for a couple decades at this point, but the 'stable' packaging metnality really holds it back in the gaming space - kernels and drivers are sometimes too stable (also known as ooooooold) to work with some newer functionality. I've had pretty good luck with Fedora, though the vanilla Fedora installation required some tweaks to make it play nice (media codecs and such). I understand Nobara is just Fedora with a lot of those tweaks pre-applied, but I haven't personally tried it.",linux_gaming

You're going to want to switch your main GPU to the 6700XT. AMD cards work a lot better in Linux. Using the 3070 for the Windows VM would be a better experience. Even if you don't use Arch, their wiki has a ton of great information that can translate to pretty much every other distro. It'll tell you what needs to be done and you'll have to just translate that to how you do it in your chosen distro. Here's the info on GPU passthrough: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF

There is even an entire subreddit for it:  /r/vfio
  
I also have two video cards and was using GPU passthrough initially with a 6800XT as main and a 6600XT as passthrough also on an R9 5900X CPU. It works well. That said, I have found that I used it so very little that I have since taken out my 6600XT and all the games I play work in Linux just fine.
  
Sharing one steam library between Windows and Linux, while theoretically possible, is a huge pain in the ass and I don't recommend doing it. You will notice ""weirdness"" and stuff just not working quite right.  
  
If you have any other questions throw them at me and I'll try to answer them.  
  
EDIT: You asked about lookingglass. I've used it and it does work quite well for what it is, however, the video latency for me is still quite noticeable. Normally how I frequently used it was for ""housekeeping"" crap on the VM, updates, installs, anything that wasn't latency sensitive, and then for gaming I would just use the looking-glass-client to pass through my input with SPICE, then switch my monitor to my second graphics card's input and game that way.",linux_gaming

jg54ire,"If I'm not mistaken, the easiest distro to do passthrough on is Arch, but unless you have specific games that you know won't work and really care about, I wouldn't go that route since it can be pretty complicated. If you really want that route, you're gonna need to use libvirt and KVM. Check out virtmanager (a front end for it) to get started. Here's [a guide](https://clayfreeman.github.io/gpu-passthrough/) I found that looks promising, though I haven't tried it. I'd urge you not to do this unless you need to.

Beyond that there's no ""right"" distro, and every distro can be changed overtime to suit your liking. It's all about choice.

Here's some choices you can make:

- Desktop Environment/Window Managers (Probably biggest decision):
  + This is your main way of displaying windows and launching applications and such
  + Questions to ask: How much bloat am I okay with/want to spend time removing? How much like Windows does it need to be? Do I want to customize at all?
  + GNOME
    - the closest thing to a ""standard"" that we have in Linux atm. Or at least its library is.
    - It's what Ubuntu, Pop\_OS\!, Fedora, etc use by default, and thus has a lot of support. It's what I use personally.
    - There are ways to tweak it, like I have auto-tiling extensions and Arc-Theme and more, BUT in general, they're going for an out-of-the-box experience, and it has an intended way to be used
    - It's designed to:
      * show notifications and have device settings in the top bar, but has no system tray which you might need for certain apps (ofc, you can just add a tray icons extension to bring them back)
      * start apps via the Super/Win key and type rather than clicking (though there is an app menu when pressing Super+A)
      * Not have a dock (again tho, extensions)
    - It comes with a large suite of, well, really quite good basic applications, but you can uninstall most of them if you don't want them
    - Best support for NVIDIA + Wayland. You probably don't need to know about that right now, but if you use GNOME, you probably won't have to worry about it at all.
  + KDE
    - The best whole desktop experience if you want lots of customization
    - Very windows-y by default
    - Nice set of Apps. All start with k. Some are definitely bloat
    - A little more buggy than GNOME, but not enough to warrant not using it
    - Kinda wonky on Wayland
    - Uses Qt which ""lost"" the GUI wars
  + Xfce
    - more customizable than KDE
    - not pretty out of the box. You'll need to customize
    - uses the same GUI system as GNOME, GTK, which is the de-facto standard
    - BY FAR BEST PANEL
    - Solid app selection. I use Thunar, the Xfce file manager, despite using GNOME
    - Windows-like
  + Mate:
    - Windows-like.
    - Based on old GNOME (but updated) which was mimicing old Windows
    - Kinda rigid in my experience
  + DIY Window Manager
    - You can just make your own DE. Pick only apps you want and choose a window manager
    - minimalistic
    - better tiling if that's something you think you'd like
    - even more customizable than KDE
    - a lot of work to maintain
    - learning curve
    - missing things sometimes, so wouldn't recommend to a beginner
- Main Package managers/Release Cycle:
  + Note: mostly matters for drivers. Application-wise, you really should use Flatpak, AppImage, or snap (I use AppImages) which are distro-agnostic package formats that tend to have up-to-date graphical applications
  + Debian distros use APT and tend to be stable and use older software.
  + Arch-based distros and OpenSUSE use package managers that are on the bleeding edge. Great for graphics drivers, for instance. You might consider this unstable, but really you're only likely to get a break every 3 or more years
  + Fedora is a nice middle ground. Up-to-date, but tested, just a tad behind Arch. It's why I use it.
  + There's some other options too that are pretty interesting like Nyx, but for someone new, I wouldn't recommend them yet
- Application package manager:
  + Flatpak:
    - current ""leader"" in this race
    - hard to develop for tho bc of portals and bc flathub, where you'll get most of your flatpaks, has strict rules on what's allowed, so you're not always going to find something available for it
    - Still can have dependency hell
    - Doesn't respect your theme if your theme isn't also a flatpak
    - Pro: sandboxed
    - Con: sandboxed (doesn't always integrate with the system)
    - Most apps right now, so it's what I'd recommend to you.
  + AppImage:
    - Download and run and that's it. No dependencies
    - Store in Applications folder and a program called ""appimaged"" can automatically integrate with your system
    - Dead simple to make, so as it gains more popularity, there's nothing stopping everything from being an AppImage, but like flatpak and snap, currently 
  + Snap:
    - Just don't. It's just worse flatpak
    - Auto-update is cool tho

I know it's a lot, so let me just say that personally, I'd recommend for you Fedora with KDE with Flatpak, which is just the Fedora KDE spin. However, if you liked the sound of any of the other stuff better, I can give you other distros. You can also change them at any time.",linux_gaming
jg3o1qp,"Try Pop OS. I tentatively made the jump last year. Couldn't believe how much I didn't miss Windows. I've tried a bunch of different distros, and IMO Pop OS has the most features/polish out of the box of any of the mainstream ones (that I've tried anyway).",linux_gaming
jg3pmi1,"For gpu vm passthrough, here's a solid written guide: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU/Guest_graphics_acceleration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU/Guest_graphics_acceleration)


There's a video guide by ""some ordinary gamers"" on YouTube, which I cannot find rn.

There's also [r/vfio](https://www.reddit.com/r/vfio) which should be very useful.


Most distros are pretty similar, but you should probably use something more mainstream for ease of troubleshooting later on. Arch based distros get (sometimes cruical for gaming) updates faster, but break more often as a result. Debian, and thus ubuntu based distros are more stable, and thus break less often. Fedora is also pretty good, but I'm not very familiar with it. The wikis for arch and gentoo are usually applicable across distros. Linux mint is based on ubuntu without the ""bad parts"", and pretty much every problem with mint can be resolved on ubuntu forums, but it also has it's own forums.

Personally I use garuda, which is a ""gaming"" distro with easier gpu driver installs, based on arch, which also comes with a gui installer.


It's possible to use the games on the windows ntfs drive, but it's quite a hassle and i'm unfamiliar with it, sooo...


You most likely won't need gpu passthrough as steam's proton works damn well nowadays unless you play AAA games with intrusive anticheats.


There are a couple tools to help you get started with gaming:

GOverlay for system use monitoring ingame.

Protonup for easy specific version installs of proton.

Lutris as an alternative games launcher with tons of options for customization and support for multiple stores such as steam, gog, and epic. You can also launch your emulation games here for other systems if you have the files.

Heroic games launcher for epic and gog.

Steam

jg4aee8,"Ubuntu and Manjaro aren't very good distros, other than that choose based on desktop environment and not distro since the distro doesn't affect much (just what's installed by default and how out of date the software is)",linux_gaming
jg4vkti,"A few pieces of advice from my own slow progress towards doing this:

* Play with some modern distros in VMs; while you can't evaluate performance or game compatibility, you can get accustomed to some of the quirks of each. Some distros sound great on paper, but actually trying them shows you how rough they are.
* Take detailed notes - I personally recommend a chunk of the VM playtime being devoted towards a 'install my stuff' bash script. Then, if you need to reinstall or switch distros, you have a starting point. A GitHub repo or Gist is good for this.
* Make a list of your hardware and software, and figure out how they work. Little things may surprise you - for example, Elgato video capture cards just DO NOT WORK under Linux. Planning these alternatives (OpenRGB for RGB control, for example) will make the process easier. Some of these changes even apply on Windows (OpenRGB is my go-to on Windows now - it's lightweight and simple).
* Choose a desktop environment carefully. Each distro has one or more defaults, and these have different behaviors; others may be able to be installed, but it will be a lot of work. For example:
   * GNOME is very popular, but one downside with it for gaming is that the WM compositor cannot be disabled. Games in fullscreen mode may work great (they use 'unredirection' to bypass the compositor) but fullscreen-windowed can be very laggy. Multi-monitor can also break this unredirection.
   * KDE has much more flexible compositor control, including per window. It's also not quite as popular these days, though easily one of the most popular WMs.
   * XFCE and MATE are very lightweight and both allow easy compositor disabling, but are generally considered uglier/simpler. Might be your taste, might not. MATE is the old Gnome 2.x, so I wouldn't expect massive changes to it.
   * i3 is a cult favorite... But, having tried it, I understand why it's a cult favorite and not mainstream. It requires learning a whole new set of shortcuts and ways of thinking how windows are arranged.
   * Disabling a compositor will disable desktop shadows, transparency, animations, etc.
* NVidia drivers are annoying. Some distros have better support than others (Pop!\_OS and Manjaro specifically stand out here), whereas others are more like pulling teeth.

There's probably other advice I can glean from my notes, but start with this.",linux_gaming
jg5h5sf,"VM's generally won't help you with gaming if it's to get around the anti cheat software because the anti cheat software that doesn't run in linux also won't let you run the game through a VM.

Personally, I run Fedora on my workstation and Debian/proxmox on my server.",linux_gaming
jg3w3e4,"My best recommendation would be to get an old pc, or laptop to learn Linux. You really don't want to risk borking your primary machine, while you are still learning the basics of Linux.

Dual booting would be the next step. It's not too complicated, but for best reliability use dedicated disks, each with its own dedicated efi partition.

Setting up VFIO / GPU passthrough is not trivial and success is largely dependent on your specific hardware. Your motherboard's IOMMU groups and your specific GPUs will determine the level of success. IMHO, this isn't the best place to start, if you don't really have a good grasp of Linux basics. Obviously, though, YMMV.",linux_gaming
jg480ri,"I have experience with VFIO, and I personally highly discourage it if you can help it. It's extremely finicky and hardware-specific, and will require different steps depending on your MOBO, CPU, GPU, monitor, and even peripherals. As such, there isn't really a ""definitive guide"" for it, as any step-by-step walkthrough will inevitably only show what worked for the writer of the guide. Also, Looking Glass isn't a VM, but rather a ""virtual monitor"" that lets you see the video output of your passed-through GPU so that you don't need to switch monitors.

First, ask yourself if you even need VFIO in the first place. What games do you even play? At this point, anti-cheat games are the only games that don't work in Linux. VR games also don't work unless you have a compatible headset.  If you want to do VR in a VM, you are in for a world of pain and suffering. If you play an anti-cheat game, there's a decent chance it works in Linux.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of major games that don't function on Linux because of anti-cheat: Destiny 2, Valorant, R6 Siege, Ghost Recon Wildlands/Breakpoint, PUBG, Tarkov, post-2019 COD games, DB FighterZ, DB Xenoverse 2, SMITE, Black Desert, Fortnite, and Rust. Of these, Valorant, Siege, Tarkov, Rust, and possibly Fortnite don't work in VMs, and YMMV for the rest.

The anti-cheat games I play (Hunt, Halo, Elden Ring, Genshit, among some others) work on Linux. If you play any of those games and insist on VFIO, I'll direct you to r/vfio.

As for distro, whatever. Really, whatever. Unless you have extremely new hardware (which you don't), pretty much anything will do. Ubuntu is fine.

Ubuntu had a release this month, so, they're perfectly up to date. Ignoring that though, you seem to be operating under the assumption that you need to run a windows VM, which is less true now than ever. I have not spun up a single windows VM under linux since I switched and I've been playing games just like normal. There are under 5 games in my steam library that I played with any degree of regularity that I can't on linux through proton, and of those I only really was actively playing one, which DROPPED proton support intentionally and can actually run fine under proton. That major fuck you to their playerbase meant I was pretty happy dropping the game snice they intentionally decreased compatibility and locked their players onto windows intentionally 

I cannot really stress enough how unlikely it is you will need a windows VM. Unless you know for a fact a specific game you want to play requires windows, I'd worry far more about ust getting your feet under you on linux since more than likely your games will work fine. ProtonDB is an excellent resource for verifying compatibility and, out of the top 1000 games, only 4% are ""borked"" and only 8% are Bronze or below. In other words, 92% of the top 1000 games in the steam catalog play perfectly fine. (oh and of those that are bronze, some are just buggy on both windows and linux, so the linux behaviour is identical to windows, it's just a badly written game)

When you do it like that then you can have all your gaming bookmarks in your browser in Windows. - OR if you dont need to separate work/home/game like I do you can just use Google Chrome's built in sync to sync the bookmarks between Windows and linux. ( I sync only bookmarks and turn everythjing else off in Chrome settings).

Gaming is pretty good in linux - just that in my experience - if it works 90% of the time, that 10% of the time I have to make extra decisions as to where to install the game (""should this go in linux, or windows"") - it's a hassle. 

Either go 100% linux gaming and accept the limitations and additional setup, or dual boot and keep all your games in Windows. In which case, no need to deal with sharing the steam library. 

Having said all that, for a dual booter you may still want to keep most partitions in NTFS then you can easily mount them in linux. So you can eg. keep your mp3/videos  accessible from windows and linux.

things to do for an advise;

select a Desktop system.  You can install any desktop you like to any distro as in theorically, 

main stream desktops are available for any distro too. as **Gnome-shell, KDE Plasma, Deepin Desktop,**

1. use app store.
2. get used to shell if you get used to it , its reliable robust fast. u will love it.
3. install Steam, Lutris, ProtonUp-QT later on you can try Bottles for windows games.
4. use open source drivers for GPU especially AMD Radeon Rx6xxx drivers are awesome novadays. its called Mesa drivers.

my favorite distro is Manjaro Linux.  I recommend it with Kde Plasma desktop but best distro is what you like to use. There is no worst or best distro there is just a distro works out of the box for most of your needs. and rest is just need a little configuration to become usefull as your favorite one.

Flatpak Warning 

- If your steam install is done using Flatpak  that can result in the steam program being sandboxed and limited in what it can access. I have no experience with how this limits things, the **flatseal** tool may be needed to manage the flatpak steam program.  You can setup the specific flatpak to have access to other filesystems and mountpoints outside of your home. 

the command `flatpak list`

  should show if you have steam installed via flatpak or not.

Flatpak notes at the end..

----

I have NO idea how the steam SNAP version differs in how it can access other locations either.   

----

Continueing with the normal guide now..  

------

Steam Game Directory on NTFS (fat32/exfat/vfat)

1. **don't use the file manager to mount the filesystem**
2. setup a  `/etc/fstab`   line to mount it at boot time
3. you do NOT (typically) use chown or chmod on  a mounted NTFS. (you do use those commands  with ext4)


example fstab entry.

------

            UUID=1234-your-uuid-56789 /media/gamedisk ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,user,exec,nofail,umask=000 0 0 

**You Do NOT use  all of  those options for ext4**  

------

On Ubuntu you can use 'ntfs' instead of ntfs-3g  for the filesystem in the fstab options if you have ntfs-3g installed , it auto changes  NTFS to be ntfs-3g. Other distribution may differ.  When ntfs3 gets more commonplace, and stable likely people will switch to using ntfs3, and drop ntfs-3g

Newer Distribution and kernels may use the `ntfs3` driver, I have not tested that driver.  Try it out and see if it works. 

The various issues and problems with ntfs getting mounted Read Only still apply.  (hit up the numerous NTFS  under Linux guides for more information)  These issues also apply to exfat,vfat, fat32, and I imagine using ntfs3.  Disable windows hibernate/suspend and fast boot if sharing a filesystem between linux and windows.


And ..

it's best to not use ntfs for your game storage drive , it can be  slower and more of a CPU load.  It does Work for me, but it is slower in my experience.

also.. there are a lot of bad/wrong/old  posts/blogs/guides  on this topic. so watch out for those.  (some of the info here may be wrong, so dont trust this guide 100%)

 This guide may be outdated or wrong when we start using ntfs3.



Also be sure to check out this guide, and the part about the compatdata directory 



https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Using-a-NTFS-disk-with-Linux-and-Windows#preventing-ntfs-read-errors


--------

bonus tip.   **Steam scale ui Tweak.:**

set a system variable to have steam scale up it's UI.

             $    GDK_SCALE=2  steam

edit your steam .desktop file to make it the default option, or make a second .desktop file for a steam 2x Launcher.


--------

STEAM on an ext4 or other Linux filesystem.

basic outline..

format the Filesystem, get the UUID
make directory for the mount  

           mkdir /home/bob/games 
 
make fstab entry. 

      UUID=123-YOUR-UUID /home/bob/games ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0

mount the filesystem  

          sudo mount /home/bob/games 


make the Filesystem owned by your user.  

         sudo chown bob.bob /home/bob/games 


reboot to make sure it mounts.

use steam and tell it to put a steam library on /home/bob/games
install games as normal.

------------------

**ntfs3 notes**

from user mandiblesarecute who gives an example with ntfs3

      PARTLABEL=Win10     /media/win10    ntfs3   noacsrules,noatime,nofail,prealloc,sparse                                       0 0

 noacsrules **makes everything effectively 777** for when you don't need or care about fine grained access control. 
 
This 777 mode can be annoying and a security issue  in some use cases which is why it's not the default.

I had issues using  `Ntfs3`, so  for now I still use `Ntfs-3g `, i will test out ntfs3 again in the future as it matures. 


------

**Steam flatpak notes from another user. TimRambo1**

For flatpaks  you want to  use the **flatseal** tool to allow access to the filesystem mountpoint of your steam games filesystem.

example: add  mount point 
**/home/(username)/games/**

 under **filesystem** under the steam settings in **flatseal**. 

The filesystem still has to be properly mounted (as shown above)

jg48pt6,Problem I personally have been facing running games in Linux (Ubuntu) was that most anti-cheat and some older (disc-based) DRM refuses to work.

I don't know why you want a lower resolution though, there seems a problem with your whole setup if your normal resolution is making problems",linux_gaming
jge8qby,"Basically:

Entry script (sets scale to 100%) contains this line:

And then the scripts are hooked in by the game's Steam launch options:

    sh /path/to/script/entryScript.sh; gamemoderun %command%; sh /path/to/script/exitScript.sh

This is Manjaro, so your launch options might be different (on Ubuntu, calling scripts didn't need the 'sh' bits).

I've set my scripts to also set/unset the vidcard's performance level:

    nvidia-settings -a ""[gpu:0]/GPUPowerMizerMode=1""

(1=performance, 2=auto; the above line is in my entry script, the exit script sets this value to 2)

And these scripts also overclock/reset the GPU:

    nvidia-settings -a ""[gpu:0]/GPUGraphicsClockOffset[3]=150""
    nvidia-settings -a ""[gpu:0]/GPUGraphicsClockOffset[4]=150""
    nvidia-settings -a ""[gpu:0]/GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset[4]=1000""
    nvidia-settings -a ""[gpu:0]/GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset[4]=1000""

Modern kernels do still have good ISA soundcard support: I've been able to build a recent kernel, run it on my old 486, and have full support for an old (pre-plug-and-play) Sound Blaster 16, including OPL3 FM synth, and WaveBlaster MIDI through ALSA. I haven't managed to build a dISAppointment for my modern machine yet, but if the weird bridge setup stuff can be done, I'd expect you'd just be able to load the appropriate kernel module (with the right ioport/irq/dma options), and it should just work…

That being said, Linux also supports a number of PCI and (at least one) PCIe soundcards with OPL3-compatible FM synths. I use a CMI8738-based PCIe soundcard from ebay (there are lots of them around), and FM synth already works out of the box. Only ScummVM and my own [Omnispeak Commander Keen port](https://davidgow.net/keen/omnispeak.html) work with it out of the box. Though you can load instruments with [sbiload](https://flaterco.com/kb/audio/Semi_MIDI_Linux.html) and use normal ALSA midi playback.

There's also things like the RetroWave OPL USB synth, and the OPL3LPT parallel-port synth, which are supported by some programs.

I'm working on [a library](https://github.com/sulix/liboplhw) to make supporting all of these in apps easier.

jg7fyna,"Everybody is saying, undervolting isn't possible, which is partially correct.
You probably want to undervolt to get a powerlimit and a lower maximum clock. Setting a powerlimit and a max clock speed is actually pretty simple.

The NVIDIA-Driver comes with the `nvidia-smi` command. It's super usefull to monitor the behaviour of you card.

For example, you can run `nvidia-smi -l 1` in a terminal to watch what your GPU is doing. The parameter `-l 1` is short for `--loop=1` and makes it repeat every second. There is also a `-lms`, short for `--loop-ms=` which does the same in Milliseconds. Although, I prefer `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi`

But that's not all. The Tool also can change some hardware settings termporatily or even permanently.

For example `sudo nvidia-smi -i 0 -pl 200` temporarily sets the Powerlimit (`-pl` short for `--power-level=200`) to 200W on your graphics card with id-number 0 (`-i 0`). 

There is also a `-lgc` option, short for `--lock-gpu-clocks=min,max`. And... well. It locks a min and a max clock speed.
A command would look like `sudo nvidia-smi -i 0 -lgc 0,1930` or something which would set the minimum clock speed to 0MHz and the maximum clock speed to 1930MHz. You can also say something like `sudo nvidia-smi -i 0 -lgc 2000` which would force the clock to always stay at exactly 2000MHz (I wouldn't recommend that...).

There are similar options for GPU memory too. If you want to see more, run `nvidia-smi -h` which gives you an overview.

Over all, this technically isn't direct undervolting. 
You can combine those settings to get exactly the behaviour you want.
It results in undervolting but with a more granular control over what the result on your overall system will be.

There is a similar tool for (newer) AMD cards called `rocm-smi`. I don't know if it is automatically installed like `nvidia-smi` or if it has to be installed manually. It has about the same functionality, just different parameter names. It can even set a voltage curve.
But (if you have an AMD card) look around on gpuopen com.
There are a bunch of professional profiling tools available, originally designed for machinelearning and workstations, that give you very detailed settings on your GPU hardware. Some even graphically.",linux_gaming

jg7xrje,"unvolting is entirely different from changing power limits and clocks. A lower clock speed will directly impact performance, as will a lower power limit. On the other hand undervolting does neither; so long as you provide enough voltage for the card to function it will work perfectly normally with reduced power draw and thermals. 

The fact that nvidia hasn't implemented this functionality is bordering on flat out unacceptable for this very reason. I am able to undervolt my gpu by around 80-100mv on windows IIRC  (though that may be CPU, not 100% vivid on it) and just flat out can't do anything on linux becuase Nvidia haven't bothered to implement it. On the other hand, they'll gladly remove functionality from the linux drivers to maintain ""feature parity between operating systems"".",linux_gaming

jg81gem,"It decreases the wattage but results in a proportional increase in efficiency. The excess voltage is there as headroom to account for differences in silicon, but if you have good silicon a lower voltage can be used and it wont cause any performance losses until the voltage gets low enough that the card begins to glitch & lose stability.

Think about it like an LED array, increasing the voltage to the LEDs will make them light up brighter, but if you're only looking for a binary signal that doesn't help; so you should provide the minimum amount of power necessary to be able to tell when an LED is on. Any excess power you send to the LED serves to heat it up, and doesn't help since you don't care about how much light it's generating, just that you can tell whether it's on or not.

I don't really follow this logic. If you buy games ""exclusively during sales"", is it because:

A) You want to get the best possible price? If so, you are getting the best possible price now, because they will not put it on sale.

The game maintains the same price in dollars even as that price means less value over time) which combined with the huge amount of people buying Factorio making it unlikely that they're struggling to keep the doors open and the amount of other companies caught using the supply chain issues and inflation as an excuse to raise prices for profits sake just makes it seem like bald-faced greed to me.",linux_gaming

Factorio is a game with regional pricing. It's [pretty affordable](https://steamdb.info/app/427520/) in most countries and when compared to games like [The Last of Us Part 1](https://steamdb.info/app/1888930/) (~60% more expensive, and only ""Part 1""), or other new titles, it's already cheaper than most ""new"" games.

You are free to disagree with their policy, but I feel that this is a perfectly reasonable alternative to the norm. It's one of my most-played games, with thousands of hours played. Not only do I think it's good value for money, I also think the developers are some of the most professional and quickest-to-respond that I've ever seen. They have a fantastic blog that they have used to explain a lot of the development process, both during the early access process and afterwards, and continue to post regular patches and improvements to their modding API for mod authors to use.

jg5pkam,">Factorio is a game with regional pricing. It's pretty affordable in most countries and 

Funnily enough, that regional pricing wound up giving some regions a double dosage of inflation adjustment because Steam had already adjusted their prices when Factorio did their jump. 

>when compared to games like The Last of Us Part 1 (~60% more expensive, and only ""Part 1""), or other new titles, it's already cheaper than most ""new"" games.

Most *AAA* games, sure. But the deal of $30 in exchange for a lot of hours of fun gameplay is a pretty typical price for indie or AA titles however and Wube did not stand out for their pricing...until they did the increase, but that's not standing out in a good way. I mean, compare it to the likes of Stardew Valley which is another incredibly addictive, fun indie title: Stardew Valley costs less than Factorio does OOTB, has had significant post-release support, goes on sale down to less than $10 regularly, etc. It also has gone from around $20 to $15 RRP in a similar timeframe that Factorio has existed. 

Factorio never offered any greater value than other indie titles that had come before it and now offers worse value than most of them between their no sales policy and hiking the price up years after launch using an excuse that directly goes against the accepted norm in the industry.

>Their mantra is that they set a cheaper price to begin with and then don't put it on sale.

As I said, that'd be something people could look past on its own but that's not what the problem is here.

>I also think the developers are some of the most professional and quickest-to-respond that I've ever seen. They have a fantastic blog that they have used to explain a lot of the development process, both during the early access process and afterwards,

Yeah no, they had one of the founders using his official account to go off to the point where the /r/factorio mods had to point out to him that he was breaking their rules and they'd still punish him despite being a dev. [This is still all public

> and continue to post regular patches and improvements to their modding API for mod authors to use.

Another thing that's not really that uncommon in the indie world.

In that case the game is actually worth less once most of your friends have played it and the memes are stale. But for slow-buildup indie games like Factorio, Minecraft, and Kerbal Space Program, that effect isn't there. 

Because sale figures slowly drop over time. 

I get that Factorio was cheap for the amount of gameplay it offers and that they could have priced it higher out of the gate, but that doesn't prevent it from being anti-consumer to jump up the price when they're reportedly making plenty of money either way nor does it compare well to other indie games which also came out priced way lower than they could have been yet didn't increase prices. Stardew Valley being the elephant in the room here, it came out at $20 and is now $15 but also goes on sale to like $7.50, while offering similar amounts of potential gameplay to Factorio, having a huge modding scene, having 5 additional free content patches since release one of which is pretty much a mini expansion pack, etc.

Even out of your three indie examples Factorio is the only one who increased prices post-launch, yet the other two games both saw quite a lot more content added post-release than Factorio has with v1.1 being confirmed to be the only major content patch ever.

>On the contrary, more and more bugs have been fixed over time, features have been added, and the cost of a computer fast enough to run it well has dropped through the floor. The game is worth more today than when it came out.

The Sims 4 has had more and more bugs get fixed over time, more new features and content added than the single major content patch for Factorio and came out the same month that Wube was founded...Yet Sims 4 is now free to play for the base game, not worth more today than when it came out.

And again, those indie games from before all fit under the same umbrella: Still get bug fixes, have had more added features/content than Factorio has, similar in terms of overall age and yet Minecraft/KSP remain the same price while SDV has depreciated to $15 with regular sales to half that. Factorio does not stand out in after-market support *at all* and I do not understand why people keep trying to act like it does to justify them increasing the price when there's so many easy examples of games that offer more after-market support while still depreciating or at worst, maintaining value.

>There is not actually anything wrong with making a profit, and the ideologies that say there is are crystallized envy.

That just makes me think you've got blinders on in regards to what Wube does because they made your favourite game.

When was I talking about the games *with* their DLC? Even the base games offer access to the modding scenes and if I am buying all the DLC well guess what? Now I'm playing a game with a lot more variety of gameplay and depth of features than Factorio offers because for both games basically every major subsystem got worked over and expanded on with the DLCs, meaning the value proposition hasn't changed.

Also, Sims 4's base game is entirely free to play at this point. Yes, it's because of the DLC being their main source of income these days but it's also hardly anti-consumer if the kickbacks are now being passed onto the consumer in the form of a free game that's still getting reasonably large free content updates with [the latest patch last month adding an entire new lifestate for free](https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-infants-dev-diary). 

That's also something that stands in stark contrast to Wube confirming that Factorio 1.1 is the last major free content update for Factorio and anything new will be DLC, alongside Sims 4 depreciating until the base game is free while apparently Factorio is the one and only game that deserves to only ever appreciate in value which funnily enough was something that was previously only reserved for retro games that are starting to get hard to find for reasons that do not apply by any stretch of the imagination to a digitally distributed game.

>Ah, yes, the company that infamously makes people buy the same game a 2nd time to get the bug fixes.

Yup, that company. They've still managed to bring quite a large chunk of the modding potential the PC versions of their games have to console which requires significant work on their behalf to make work and keep working, or in other words pass the benchmark of continuing ""to post regular patches and improvements to their modding API for mod authors to use"" which is the benchmark you set...Not my fault if your standards for Wube are low.",linux_gaming

Can you post the output again but in text form (e.g. on Pastebin) instead of an image? So that it'll be easier to copy/paste/adapt a part that I'd give you to launch the game manually and (hopefully) have a log from Wine.

At least the part at 18:03:35 that starts with ""Launching Alien breed..."" and ends at ""--platform windows"", that's the command that HGL is launching.

**EDIT:** turns out that I have the game on GOG (guess they gave it away for free at some point), so I gave it a try.

First, I tried with HGL to have the same options as you (note that I installed the game manually, not by connecting to my GOG account but I don't think it would change anything). Couldn't get the game to start, though I don't have a crash dialog, just nothing. No information from Wine either.

Then, I tried with Lutris, with which I'm more familiar. Same: no crash, nothing, no output from Wine. Tried a few things but no change.

Finally, I tried to run it manually through Wine, so that I would be sure to get more informations and... nothing, same behavior as with HGL or Lutris, no output from Wine (immediately back to the command line input).

The fact that I don't have a crash while you do might not be really important as I don't have the same hardware (using an AMD GPU) but not having any output from Wine is really weird. Especially as the game is rated platinum on the AppDB (with recent reports) and on ProtonDB. I wonder if there's something specific with the GOG version that triggers issues with Wine (though that would be the first time I see that).

**EDIT 2:** nevermind, I found out what the issue was (in my case, at least) on the GOG forums: the game needs the UE3 runtime (basically, the engine) that's not installed automatically.

If you haven't done so, use the option to start an exe from inside the prefix (I think I've seen that in the HGL interface) and launch UE3Redist.exe that should be in `/home/giuseppe/Games/Heroic/Prefixes/Alien Breed Impact/pfx/drive_c/GOG Games/Alien Breed Impact/Binaries/windows`.

For options like DXVK, Fsync, etc. if you use apps to handle Wine easily like Heroic Games Launcher or Lutris, I guess they'll have informations more or less complete in their documentation.

DXVK and VKD3D should always been used. There are some fringe cases where they can cause issues for games but they're very specific.

Basically, until a few years ago, we only had OpenGL on Linux, so Wine had to translate Direct3D calls (which doesn't exist on Linux) to OpenGL, with more or less efficiency. Then, Vulkan was introduced, which is the replacement of OpenGL, a new graphic API more efficient, with more possibilities.

DXVK and VKD3D are used to translate Direct3D calls to Vulkan instead of OpenGL and are far more efficient, you'll get more fps when using Vulkan than OpenGL. DXVK is used for Direct3D 9, 10 and 11, while VKD3D handles Direct3D 12.

(You might also come accross mentions of D9VK and Gallium Nine but they're somewhat obsolete: D9VK was an independant implementation of Direct3D 9 to Vulkan but is now integrated in DXVK; Gallium Nine is a proper implmentation of Direct3D 9 on Linux and can be used instead of DXVK for old DirectX 9 games but I'm not sure it's really worth it now compared to DXVK.)

I'm not too familiar with Esync and Fsync. They're supposed to better handle filesystem access and memory caching respectively, AFAIK. Again, they can cause issues in some fringe cases, so generally use them but if some games don't start or have weird issues, that's the kind of stuff that you can try to disable to see if it changes anything.",linux_gaming

* [Gamemode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)
* [GameScope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope)

* Custom kernel ([Xanmod](https://xanmod.org/) / [Liquorix](https://liquorix.net/))

From this you already got a extremely lightweight desktop, but hard to produce.

If you want to go down the rabbit hole you need to understand about your machine:

* Configuring your own kernel parameters
* Configuring C/C++ compiler parameters to match your processor and optimizations
* Making unfocused apps use like 3 FPS at background
* Removing manually every unnecessary/legacy library that got downloaded/built without your knowledge and linking every of these commands to a profile
* Compiling most of the apps by yourself (use different paths to not lose your track on them)

Among other things.

Don't be scared about all of this. The main reason Linux exist is to provide freedom to the users, as they can do whatever they want to improve their usage. Being it visual or technical.

jg4yuqc,"I'd say avoid Manjaro. Sounds good on paper, but a lot of what you're going to want or want to try is on the AUR. And while the AUR is available on Manjaro, it is exceptionally risky, as the AUR assumes that you're running an up to date Arch installation. Manjaro uses it's own repositories that it intentionally keeps two weeks behind Arch releases for testing (I seriously doubt they really spend all that much time actually testing stuff, but that's just my thoughts). And long term Linux will tell you, mismatched packages are a great recipe for software and system instability. Not to mention Manjaro has done silly things like not keep their SSL certificates up to date.

If you want to ride the bleeding edge, get endeavor or Arch (it has an install script now). Otherwise I'd suggest giving Fedora KDE a spin. Others will suggest Nobara, but it's maintained by a small crew that is bound to burn out sooner or later. I'd also avoid Ubuntu or anything based off it. Canonical, the people behind Ubuntu are less interested in keeping their packages up to date, and more with using their proprietary package distribution system, snap. Which would be fine except canonical themselves are the dictators of what is on the snap site and what isn't, which is not something I'd trust a for profit company with for a universal software distribution. And while mint and pop os generally do fine removing that cancer, the base they're built on is still rotting.

Do you have a similar issue with other FOSS projects asking for funds, like ElementaryOS or Zorin? It's not mandatory for any of these projects and you can simply either build the projects yourself or download them. Why treat CDDA differently?

The license simply stipulates that you provide attribution to the original authors, and distribute any modifications under the same license.

jg0cads,"I believe the license does allow for this, but I'm also fairly confident that the former contributors who are upset aren't mad because of a perceived copyright violation.  They acknowledge it is legal, they are just upset because it's emblematic of the project management difficulties that they feel plagues the DDA fork (which is the largest and most popular fork of Cataclysm, and the one in question).

There is a perception that the DDA management team is extremely draconian and prone to making sweeping project decisions without consulting anyone, as well as rejecting PRs and contributions from anyone else at the slightest whim, often without discussion.  It has led to the perception that the inner circle of devs can do whatever they want with no oversight, but contributions made by anyone else are scrutinized with a microscope.  The announcement of the Steam release echoed that, as it seemed to come out of nowhere.  If there was a discussion about doing it, it never to my knowledge reached the wider community before it was decided and announced, which only serves to reinforce the feeling of a stark divide between the senior contributors and everyone else.

(Full disclosure, I am also a former [minor] contributor.  I think this perception may be somewhat overblown, but it is far from inaccurate.  My biggest reason for quitting was that trying to submit PRs to the C:DDA repo was *insanely* stressful to a degree I've never felt elsewhere.  I never had a PR shut down without warning, but I'm fairly confident it was only because I was extremely selective in the ones I tried to submit.)

Was this move illegal?  No.  Was it morally wrong?  Probably also no.  Is it the cherry on top of a long history of bad blood over project management disagreements that has only inflamed existing frustrations further?  Very much yes.

My personal opinion as a minor contributor is that I'm not going to care that they took my code and that someone else is making money off of it without asking.  That was indeed a possibility implied by the license, and if I cared enough I could fork DDA at any moment (or jump over to one of the other existing forks like Bright Nights).  On the other hand, it's was definitely a tacky decision and one more reason I'm probably never going to go back to the project.",linux_gaming

That seems to be the only upshot of the Steam release, so there isn't really much to incentivize me besides achievements (don't care) and to financially support the dev. The latter would be the only thing tempting me, but it isn't enough for me (and I'm sure many others) to go beyond playing the game for free.

I'm not a longtime CDDA player. I've only played for maybe 5 years, and maybe a few times a year at that. Given that, the Steam release just isn't worth it to me.

No, I'm only giving impressions and opinion.

So, just as a ""first observations"" thing, I have to say I'm impressed being a newcomer (literally went from Windows 10 => Arch Linux 2 weeks ago).  I didn't think Linux gaming would have come so far.

Almost all of my games are on Steam, I haven't tried any other source like [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) (Starcraft).  But I'm pretty much able to play every game in my Steam library.  The only exception I've found is Atelier Ryza 3, which was released less than a month ago.

There's some fiddling to get things working and stable.  But once I did, performance was not lacking compared to my old PC in any imaginable manner.  I immediately tested some AAA games (FF7 Remake, FF15, Cyberpunk 2077, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Hogwarts Legacy) and everything works and works better and smoother (Cyberpunk in particular is **spooky** smooth even when the FPS counter goes from 120 => 60).

The reason why I say I won't provide data is because it's not an apples to apples comparison.  My old PC was 5 years old, everything has a generational uplift (PCIe M.2 3.0 => 5.0, DDR4 => DDR5) and a big change in vendors (Intel => AMD, Nvidia => AMD).

The installation guide is top notch and you were already thinking about doing Manjaro-Architect, which is nearly as complicated.

Follow the installation guide for Arch (including at least making a new user on general recommendations page).

Configure a bootloader (if you're not dual booting, systemdboot is easy)

Throw the display manager of your choice on there (I would personally advise staying on Wayland, so Gnome, KDE Plasma/Wayland, Sway, etc).

What is missing from your commentary is your GPU and drivers. I assumed you were using an NVidia card based on a post you made regarding VLC Media player, but not the exact version or GPU. You are running dxvk 2.1 (v2.1 in latest Lutris) which does require a newer version of the nvidia prop drivers (525 or better is recommended). However I wonder if you have added \_\_GL\_SHADER\_DISK\_CACHE\_SKIP\_CLEANUP=1 as an environment variable (set on System Options tab if you use lutris)? This variable stops your gpl derived cache which is compiled on launch from being cleaned up (or erased) when you exit the game.

https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues

https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues

https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues

Those are basically going to be the only 3 repos that'll ever be relevant in these cases, and there is ALWAYS an open issue thread for every game on the Proton GitHub (each game gets its own issue thread), and VKD3D-Proton's most recent issue is - you guessed it - regarding the CP2077 update breaking shit. 

Anyone who ever gives you an answer on reddit for issues like these got that answer from one of those GitHub repos, and the more people who know to just skip a step and go to the issue threads themselves, the more time it will save both the new/less-technical users on this sub *and* the power-users.

Anyway, yeah the game is currently broken with RT enabled, unless you're on Nvidia and you use some specific launch options (they're stated on the VKD3D-Proton issue thread), but those launch options break DLSS capabilities, which makes trying to use Path Tracing pointless anyway, since the game would be unplayable. 

If you can't get in-game to change your settings to disable RT, just remove the `dxr11`/`dxr` from the `VKD3D_CONFIG=` environment variable you have in your launch options. That will make the game think your GPU isn't capable of RT and will auto-disable it, and then the settings you apply will persist from then on.",linux_gaming

jfxfuyc,"I've actually been thinking about contributing to rewritting the menus and wiki descriptions lately. It is very confusing. STL uses it's own folders for custom proton versions, though it should recognize proton versions in the standard compatibilitytools.d folder, but you have to reboot for that to be recognized. By the way you can force STL to put custom proton versions into the standard folder in the ""Global"" settings menu.

1. So after you click ""Play"" on steam, you'll see the STL splash window pop up for a few seconds. Hit space to open the settings.
2. Then the first option in the top left should be ""Download Custom Proton"". Click that and choose the version of proton you want to download. A new window will pop up and show it's progress.
3. When it's done click ""Game Menu"" at the bottom of the options window. It will then load into the specific options for the game that you launched.
4. Scroll down until you see ""Proton options"" section in bold. The first line in that section is where you change your proton version and you can now select the version that you just downloaded from the dropdown.
5. Make sure you hit either ""Save"" or ""Save and Play"" at the bottom to save these settings for the game.
6. (Optional) You can force the game to check for, auto-download and use the latest Proton-GE by ticking the box that says ""Auto last Proton-GE"" just a little below that in the same section. Keep in mind this can potentially cause issues depending on the game and proton version. Sometimes bugs slip through with Proton-GE, including worst case scenario that I've personally seen, losing your entire prefix and game saves along with it. This has been very rare in the past, but it's worth noting.

(Even more Optional) You can apply these settings to all subsequent games launched with STL by then hitting ""Back"" or ""Main Menu"" at the bottom of the window to go back to the Main Menu. Then select ""Default"" at the bottom of the window to go to the options that you set up as a ""default template"" for all new games launched with STL. This will only apply to games on their FIRST launch through STL. If you've already launched a game with STL before, you can delete this config and allow the template to apply. This is useful if you've made a ton of changes that you want to apply to many other games and don't want to manually change the settings for each game. You can find the conf files symlinked with game title for easy locating in the folder, $HOME/.config/steamtinkerlaunch/gamecfgs/title/.

As for gamescope, you can most easily set those settings from the Main Menu.

1. In the top right you should see a button titled ""gamescope"".
2. A new window will open with all of the gamescope options.
3. ""Game internal resolution"" is what you want the game rendered at. Set this to 4k
4. ""Game show resolution"" is what you want the window presented as/scaled to. Set this to your monitor.
5. Tick ""gamescope"" to actually enable it. Probably also want to tick ""fullscreen""
6. Set your upscaler sharpness in this menu as well and tick which scaling type you want. There is ""integer scaling"", ""nearest neighbor"", FSR, and NIS as available options.

jfy3x9y,">I didn't have that much problems setting up the Nvidia drivers (except that I forgot that GPU drivers require a reboot to work) and setting my main monitor to 144 hz (2560x1440@144hz).

So, I assume by your wording there that you have more than one monitor? And that the second monitor is a 60Hz one?

If so, that's your problem. Xorg is 100% incapable of running more than one monitor at different refresh rates. X is entirely built at its foundation on the concept that all connected monitors comprise one ""X Screen"" as far as Xorg is concerned, which means that the display server/window manager sees everything as one physical monitor when it comes to screen repaints. 

Wayland solves this. Some Xorg environments allow you to basically work around the problem by setting the FPS of the window manager to the highest refresh rate in your setup. For example, on KDE, you can force KWin to run at 144Hz, so your 144Hz monitor will look exactly like it's supposed to, and your 60Hz monitor will just look normal because even though the WM is refreshing 144 times/second, the monitor itself is only refreshing the pixels 60 times/second. 

The problem is that GNOME/Mutter doesn't allow this. KDE *with KWin* (as opposed to substituting it with i3) is the only fully-featured DE that allows setting the WM to a specific FPS, the only other options are things like i3/other standalone WMs + picom, which allows you to set a refresh rate. 

There's nothing that you can do other than a) use an Xorg WM/DE that has the functionality I mentioned, or b) move to Wayland, where this is not an issue.

On a side note, this limitation of Xorg is the exact same reason why you can't do separate per-monitor fractional scaling on any Xorg DE.",linux_gaming

Thanks for the comprehensive answer, so i3 as a standalone would solve this, I've only just realized that I probably only use the features of i3/gnome on my laptop and not really on my desktop so I'm gonna try that. The main reason I've chosen a WM with Xorg is that I've heard that Wayland and Nvidia doesn't cooperate too good.

>If so, that's your problem. Xorg is 100% incapable of running more than one monitor at different refresh rates. 

Shouldn't I notice that when I'm not playing Counter Strike? Just by quickly moving my cursor it's obvious that my main monitor is running at least at 100 fps (I assume 144) and my second one at 60.

jfz5d3j,"> Xorg is 100% incapable of running more than one monitor at different refresh rates

It's a bit more nuanced than this. When running games, I've never had an issue with Xorg, it always felt smooth and at the proper refresh rate.

It's the desktop where things were bad for me. When moving windows, it used the lower refresh rate. Scrolling in Firefox on my high refresh monitor sometimes felt slow.",linux_gaming
jfzxljf,"> X is entirely built at its foundation on the concept that all connected monitors comprise one ""X Screen"" as far as Xorg is concerned,

This is factually incorrect, the original X11 setup for multiple monitors was to have a separate screen for each monitor, before Xinerama was a thing. Xorg can have multiple screens acting completely independently, even for refresh rate and scaling, but that can be a limitation in and of itself. In this configuration the only thing that can be transferred between screens is the mouse, programs starting on one screen have to be closed to be started on another, making it cumbersome in some cases, while beneficial in others.

With the Xinerama extensions (and later XRandR extensions) moving windows between monitors was made possible albeit with the drawbacks you mentioned.

TL;DR, you can do it on X but there is a bunch of configuration and compromises involved, and that is what Wayland solves.",linux_gaming

I haven't tested FSR 2 in Cyberpunk, but the DLSS implementation is damn near perfect so I always turn it on along with RT.

Also, I'd say that's not the best area to really show off RT anyways. It's a lot of tiny, dim lights.

>And supposedly performance is going to be even worse than with the regular RT they had, so it's totally useless as of now

How is it totally useless? We were literally just debating about whether the 30fps that I was getting in Windows with the new RT mode was playable or not. 30fps is what was available on last-gen consoles and the Steam Deck, it is definitely playable and not useless.

Also, RT is only useless to you because you're refusing to use upscaling in your tests. It's also well known that the RT cores in AMD GPUs are just generally slower than Nvidia's right now, but again that just means its useless *to you*. In Proton with the Nvidia 530 drivers, I was getting anywhere from 35-65 fps @ 4k DLSS Auto with the *old* Psycho raytracing. That's more than playable for me, tbh.",linux_gaming
jfw0fnc,"Well, I can't say if it's stunning on Linux if it's not working :)

> How is it totally useless

Now it's around 15+ fps. It will be like what, 5 fps? I don't see the point of that.

And yeah, it's better to avoid upscaling while you are trying to improve image quality. Otherwise you are improving it with one hand (ray tracing) and reducing with another (upscaling).

I'd take full resolution rendering without RT with good framerate over upscaled RT.

Whole push into upscaling started becasue RT became a marketing point which GPUs can't really handle natively still with good performance.

My take on it - it will be useful when upscaling won't be necessary. So not yet in this generation of GPUs.

It's still fun to experiment with it though. And fixing bugs helps.",linux_gaming
jfw2gfg,">Well, I can't say if it's stunning on Linux if it's not working

Dude, my very first comment that you replied to was talking about my experiences playing the new RT mode *in Windows*. We were never talking about Linux specifically. At that point in the conversation, we were just discussing the visual fidelity of the new RT mode. Stop moving the goal posts.

>Now it's around 15+ fps. It will be like what, 5 fps? I don't see the point of that.

Uh yeah, because you don't have the right hardware to run it lol. Still doesn't mean it's ""totally useless"". Useless to you maybe, still doesn't mean RT isn't worth it to those who can actually run it. And like I said, I was getting 35-65 fps in the old RT, not 15.

>Otherwise you are improving it with one hand (ray tracing) and reducing with another (upscaling).

These two things are not equal and you know it. I'd gladly trade the occasional ghosting artifacts for the massive lighting improvements. 

>Whole push into upscaling started becasue RT became a marketing point which GPUs can't really handle natively still with good performance.

I get it, you're a hardcore AMD guy, and they've been historically worse at raytracing and upscaling, so of course you hate it. But honestly, hardware that can handle both these things *well* already exist, the [Digital Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ORt8313Og) video proves it. I mean seriously, *actually* take a good look at that video and tell me if you see anything wrong with the RT Overdrive + DLSS footage. I bet you that you can't. You're just trying to die on this ""upscaling is bad"" hill because you don't want to acknowledge that Nvidia actually has something decent that AMD doesn't and don't want to make fair comparisons.",linux_gaming
jfw39kb,"Not sure why you are even bringing Windows into the conversation. I only test it on Linux.

There is no ""right hardware"" for it. Not yet that is. That's my point. It only works with acceptable performance if you upscale.",linux_gaming
jfw6ap9,">Not sure why you are even bringing Windows into the conversation. I only test it on Linux.

Man, I wasn't even talking to you initially...I was talking to mbriar\_. You were the one who decided to chime in on this thread. Again, you're just shifting the goal posts lol.

>There is no ""right hardware"" for it. Not yet that is. That's my point. It only works with acceptable performance if you upscale.

I have no idea why you're just arbitrarily ignoring upscaling. That's almost the same as stubbornly running a game at 8x MSAA instead of TAA and then declaring that there's no hardware that can run it just because you don't think reconstruction is a valid rendering technique. DLSS is actually really fucking good, FSR 2 less so, but still very usable. If you look at the [Digital Foundry video](https://youtu.be/I-ORt8313Og?t=580) talking about the new RT patch, you'd be hard pressed to say that it isn't worth it for the massive boost in lighting and visual fidelity. You're just being pedantic by ignoring DLSS and FSR 2, but for most gamers it's not going to make a practical difference.",linux_gaming

Maybe what you didn't like was the Desktop Environment, which is (I will simplify a lot here) the interface of your OS, which in my opinion is more important to pick carefully than the distro (which is mostly what's under the hood).

In the case of EndeavourOS, the live session uses Xfce, but if you decide to use the distro, the installer will let you pick whatever DE you prefer. If you don't know what to pick, Gnome is the most used overall, but some like KDE Plasma or Cinnamon are pretty popular.",linux_gaming

These are no-fuss distros that are really easy to use, IMO. Immutable OSes prevent you from screwing up anything royally, as you can only touch files in your home partition, and apps are installed and handled by Flatpak natively through the GNOME/KDE software GUI app.

I personally use OpenSUSE MicroOS Desktop with the default GNOME install and it works amazingly. Have had zero issues and it's super easy to use without opening the terminal, which is relieving. The only hiccup I ran into was not knowing that I needed to grant applications permissions to files through the Flatseal app, when I wanted to hook up my drive containing my Steam library and Steam couldn't find it (because the Steam flatpak did not have permissions to see my mounted drive containing my Steam library).

There is still a bit of a learning curve, as with anything Linux, but I was pleasantly surprised.

LIke I said, experimental will still always be lacking functionality from GE by choice. Forever behind. Realistically you're just obsessing over numbers going up, not the changes behind the numbers. If it works the same way it did yesterday and you're happy with it, and there's a new version, it really doesn't matter, so you should just pick the better general default option (which is GE because it supports more games and better supports some games, and otherwise is the same) and just update it when something breaks. Plus with ProtonUp you can just click a button to update GE.

> Yes, and for those you switch to GE. Those are edge cases though, the majority of games work perfectly fine without GE and GE does not mean that it brings any sort of improvement for them.

And for those, I don't even need to switch, nor do I need two separate installs of proton taking up space. And a lot of games do run better with GE so again, there's a reason to just default to it instead of making more work for yourself.

> There's literally no reason to use GE outside of specific cases of where his specific fixes are actually needed. 

You stated exactly zero reasons against using it no reason not to use it, just tried to defend how Experimental works ""for most games, so clearly why use the one that works for an even larger majority of games?"", so you didn't state shit.

It matters to me, and from what I've seen it doesn't get enough visibility as a distinction around here. The AMDGPU driver for gaming is seriously awesome, but boy does it get under my skin it doesn't do OpenCL. For if it did, I'd probably be rocking AMD right now!

Thanks for hearing me out. :) Have a nice day!",linux_gaming
jfrjsvq,"You're misreading the situation. I do not mean video rendering or editing at the literal same time as gaming. I am talking about using the same driver for gaming and GPU offload.

AMDGPU is generally agreed upon to be the best AMD GPU driver on Linux. And in my experience, for gaming, it's the bee's knees. However, it does not provide OpenCL interfacing.

So if, on the same computer, you want to do gaming, at times, and other times you want to do GPU offload tasks, like blender, video editing or other stuff, what do you do?

Well, in the past, you could use ROCm, but like 3-4-ish years ago it stopped being viable for consumer GPUs. You know, the kind of ones you'd game on.

So you could switch to AMDGPU-Pro, which gives you OpenCL, but is tangibly worse for gaming.

You see what I'm getting at yet? Or are you still muddled up there bud?

If you don't care about gaming, and doing GPU-offload tasks on the same computer, that's fine man. But there are those of us who do, and AMD is not the option for that. Trust me, I explored it exhaustively.

Now, in my particular case, I'm not much a fan of the 4xxx nVidia GPUs either. I'm rocking an RTX 3060 ti, and I feel I'm getting my money's worth!

This will give you the best idea of what helps and what doesn't and if it's consistent.

The game itself has to include specific controller support.  Not all games support all controllers.  The most widely supported controllers are for Xbox, but there are at least two different, incompatible Xbox controller APIs (DirectInput, XInput).  Some controllers can be made to work with some games by using `xboxdrv` to emulate an Xbox 360 controller.

Owning one controller for each major system wouldn't be a terrible option.  At least one of them is bound to work, assuming the game supports gamepads at all.  You'd have backups in case any of them breaks.

The `-L` flag lists Xbox controllers.  Since you're using a PS5 controller, it wouldn't show up in the list.  To use `xboxdrv` to emulate an Xbox 360 controller, you'd have to use the `--evdev` flag to tell it specifically which device corresponds to your controller.  You'd also have to provide a button mapping.  I can't help much because I did this once long ago and saved the command in a script.

Each game has to include its own controller support.  Since there are three major game system families, you can expect only about a third of games to work with your controller.  In practice, it will be much better than that because most games support more than one system.  Compatibility software fills in most of the remaining gaps.  This is pretty much how it is no matter what controller you choose.  There are controllers with switches to support different protocols that might do better.  I've never tried any though.

Nope. 10th gen intel CPU's (esp laptop) produce an absolutely stupid amount of heat. It's ""normal"" for them to run at 95c, says the engineers.

Sadly, OP just happened to buy one of the worst laptops you could at the time. 9th gen use a little less power than 10th gen, 11th using much less than both, AMD CPUs at the time used far less power than any Intel at the time, so they had a lot less problems with the cooling.

The way you said ""never work in Linux"" is so dismissive.

Also you can check if your GPU is clocking up. For AMD I use a program called corectrl that lets me undervolt and shit, but you shouldn't need to go through the hassle of setting that up full. If you just install it you should be able to see your GPU's clock speeds. If it's clocking up and the performance is still shit then there's some software issue somewhere maybe with minecraft or something. If it's clocking up and the performance is shit then there's something probably more at the driver level. But like everyone here said, the mesa driver is better then the Windows driver and it has always had better openGL performance then the windows driver, so I would lean towards some other obscure issue.

Minecraft is very CPU bound so if there's no shader running then the GPU shouldn't be doing much. But grab a shader like Sonic Ethers PTGI HRR 3 or 2, and your GPU should be running near 100%.

What about that prevents you from monitoring your resources? if you don't have a secondary monitor you can use an overlay over your gameplay, if it freezes you have a still image you can inspect.

>And How do i know that its the dGPU? When i used the iGPU in the same games, they never crashed (of course they were running at 30-45 FPS)

That doesn't mean the problem is directly the dedicated GPU, it just means that in that configuration the problem occurs, it might mean it's more likely related to that but it could also just trigger the problem instead of being the cause of it.

>And the dGPU was around ~90°C, almost reaching critical, in ALL times when using It, so its the dGPU overheating or the drivers 

If you're so certain the problem is the temperature, what exactly are you asking? You already know you have to fix the cooling, though you did say you just think it's the case which sounds like you're not that certain. Being a laptop GPU the maximum operating temperature can vary according to the OEM, it could be anywhere between 80C to 110C (doubt it for a laptop but who knows).

>Verified with GWE during gameplay the temperature

Based on the start of your comment it seems that's before it freezes so it didn't necessarily the problem (if your GPU gets to its limits it's more likely to crash than to hang up the system).

I don't know the cooling configuration in your laptop, but some share heat pipes between the CPU and GPU, and CPUs usually have a lower operating temperature than GPUs so the problem can also be CPU related worsened by the GPU.

Throw any of my suggestions to the trash if you're so sure you have everything figured out already, but I strongly suggest you at least monitor as many resources as you can actively until the hang occurs, I think mangohud can show you active power draw too, which is a consideration in a laptop.",linux_gaming

When that game ""new world"" came out a while back it was looking specific GPU models, those only had issues with that specific game, but the game itself wasn't the problem, it just happened to expose a flaw in those GPUs, likewise if your issue occurs only when using the dGPU it doesn't mean it is the problem, it could just expose the issue, even if you can't imagine why.

Fans and hobbyists supporting the original release means people might not buy the shitty new ports (which haven't been patched in over a year). 

The original GTA trilogy used to regularly go on sale for $5. T2 commissioned a mobile studio with about 12 developers to port the entire trilogy to UE4 with such a small budget that the studio had to outsource most of the texture upscaling to people who evidently didn't even speak English. The original Dark Souls went through the same thing - price anchored at $5, upscale the textures, delist the original, price is now $35.

Now the games have even more issues than the original releases did but you have to pay the $60 that T2 thinks they're worth if you want to play them on Steam. Take Two Interactive are better criminals than anyone they portray in their games.

EDIT: Just remembered that the original devs behind FiveM aren't just legally forbidden from modifying the game by cease and desist, they're also [banned from playing GTA too](https://gtaforums.com/topic/832985-bought-a-new-game-copy-instantly-banned/).",linux_gaming

Now for picking a distro. It’s really just user preference, but I can give a few recommendations in no specific order.

FEDORA
Very solid base, and while it will take a bit of work to get it where you want, you will always be on the latest technologies and more up to date drivers etc are provided. You should have both a good experience as everything can be done graphically, and games will have what they need to run. Nvidia drivers will need to be gotten from RPMfusion

NOBARA
It is fedora but with gaming tweaks and user experience stuff pre-provided. It will be easier to set up and use, however it is maintained by one (trustworthy imo) guy, GloriousEggroll. This comes with a tool that will install nvidia drivers automatically on first-boot.


OPENSUSE TUMBLEWEED
If you are more into tweaking and messing around with your system but still want to use the gui this is great. It is very stable while always having the very latest versions of every software. It will need just as much if not more tweaking than any of the others on this list, however it is a great distro for getting into this stuff as it has Yast2. Yast2 is comparable to the windows control panel, and no other distro out there has anything quite like it. Nvidia drivers can be installed, but you will need to enable a repo for it in Yast2, and then install it. Guides can be found.

UBUNTU
Traditionally the Linux desktop, although the meta has been shifting away from it for some time now. Very solid base using stable technologies to ensure a stable and easy to use workflow, and because it is so old there is plenty of documentation of errors of all sort for it and it’s derivatives. It has in recent years been given a hard time for its refusal to adopt standards that every other distribution uses like flatpaks for apps instead of snap (likely doesn’t make a difference to you). this distro also has the most commercial support out there for desktop applications. It does however ship outdated package versions to achieve its stability, so you won’t have access to the very latest for gaming (chances are modern games will work regardless, you will just be missing out on optimizations and driver-level features). Don’t choose LTS. This has a driver manager that you can install the nvidia drivers from.

POP OS
Ubuntu+. It is derived from Ubuntu, but contains its own desktop customizations, and soon its own desktop. It hasn’t however had a release for a while as they are instead focusing efforts on creating their new desktop, so you will be on older versions than Ubuntu. This will offer nvidia drivers pre-installed.

Next, you must choose a desktop. For some of these like pop os you won’t be given a choice, for some like opensuse you won’t be given a default I will do my best to explain them, check them out in a vm because my explanations will be imperfect.

PopOS has a very unique workflow, check it out in a vm to get a feel of it.


Gnome is the default on all of those that provide a default. It is closest in workflow to macOS as it uses swappable workspaces to manage windows rather than maximize/minimize (although these can be enabled, and likely will be on many of these distros) it uses its own graphics toolkit called libadwaita to make the desktop and all apps look the same and integrated. It has commercial support from red hat, and hence gets features faster than most desktops and is very stable. It is however not very customizable.

KDE Plasma is a hyper-customizable desktop that by default looks kind of like windows. It has a lot of very active developers, and is usually similar to gnome in terms of feature adoption. It is more buggy than gnome, although this is resultant of its large amounts of customization.

There are also others, but these are the big ones.

jfgcfze,"> I'm really undecided. In your opinion, what should I do?

To be fair, that's a question only you can answer. Do you want to learn and use Linux? Then it's probably worth a shot. 

The gaming scene is vastly better than even a few years ago, but not perfect, so if you're worried or not wanting to have to learn and tweak some things (and settle with some games just not working) it might be better to stick with what you know or dual boot to dip your toes in and test.

As for distro, again there's really no best. In the end, any up to date one will game the same and can have the same configuration and tweaks, so look into some of the major ones and see what suits or interests you. 

Might not want to jump straight into something like vanilla Arch (though it's a great way to learn by diving off the deep end) but something like Endevour, Fedora, SUSE, even Ubuntu would be a fine start.

jfjqw83,"> On my nvidia system Wayland works perfectly

No it doesn't.

- X11 desktop apps on wayland don't work and are rendering random flickering frames that keep jumping back and forth between old and new frames, until this heavily contested pull request from NVIDIA is merged by Xwayland, because NVIDIA has absolutely **zero rendering synchronization** between the framebuffers and the screen: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/967
- You don't have any Night Light or any per-monitor screen color correction, because NVIDIA doesn't support the `GAMMA_LUT` color protocol on Wayland.
- Your games have 16% worse FPS on Wayland with NVIDIA GPUs, compared to X11. This was recently benchmarked by Phoronix: https://www.phoronix.com/review/wayland-nv-amd-2023/5 (and this is **in addition** to the fact that Linux with X11 already has on average [10% worse FPS than Windows 11 shown in recent benchmarks](https://www.phoronix.com/review/nvidia2022-windows11-linux/8), so you are throwing away a LOT of your GPU performance by using Wayland on NVIDIA)
- All X11 (Xwayland) games, which is practically all games since Wine/Proton renders via Xwayland (a native Wine Wayland port is being worked on though), will waste further GPU performance by always doing an extra copy of every frame when the game is running in windowed (aka ""borderless fullscreen"") mode on Wayland (this issue doesn't exist on X11), so you must play your X11 games in exclusive fullscreen mode on Wayland to get rid of that extra copy, which is a big hassle if you wanna be able to alt-tab out of the game to do other stuff at the same time: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/587
- There are many apps that still refuse to run at all on Wayland or completely fail to access the required computer resources (since Wayland uses different protocols). This includes a ton of Electron based apps that use old Electron versions (with old Chromium engines that are unstable on Wayland, or cannot access screen sharing APIs, etc), and those apps usually cannot be ported to a newer version due to using old Electron APIs. You have to give app developers much more time to port their apps to Wayland. Or look for alternative replacement apps, but there often aren't any good alternatives.
- These are just the most noticeable issues.

> Additionally Wayland solves screen tearing (with a bit of added latency)

That's what the Full Composition Pipeline setting for NVIDIA does on X11.

There is no screen tearing whatsoever on X11 with NVIDIA if you follow the guide I wrote:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/11tnxfl/comment/jck8obt/

Wayland in general is still not really ready for prime time. It's getting close but there are still pain points everywhere in apps and protocols. The extra security of Wayland has required the invention of various Wayland protocols and desktop portal protocols, and while things are getting pretty good now, there are still major things left to fix in Wayland. As a real-world example, window moving cannot be implemented on Wayland at all since the protocol lacks any way for apps to query window locations or to move windows. And the fact that other basic functionality like global keybinding (like ""Ctrl + Space opens a launcher app"") doesn't work yet is another good example of the kinds of issues you'll face, and while a protocol was recently created for that purpose, it means that every app that uses global shortcuts needs to implement this new protocol. Yes, all app creators still need to port their apps to Wayland's new security model and new protocols, which has been going nicely but there are still tons of apps that aren't compatible, and many apps that will never be updated. But like I said, give it 1-2 more years and Wayland will be close to finished.

I just hope Xwayland merges NVIDIA's work soon. It is the largest thing holding back Wayland on NVIDIA since it means X11 apps don't work and are completely unusable on NVIDIA's broken Xwayland implementation. But let's not forget that even if they someday manage to fix that (if the pull request is ever accepted), we will still have the massive loss of game FPS on Wayland with NVIDIA cards of course.

I've left Wayland for all of these reasons and more. There is no good reason to torture myself with unfinished software, when the Linux standard (X11) has had decades of maturation already.

As for ""security"", the extra security on Wayland against keyloggers and screen recorders is nice, but it's not foolproof. There are ways to connect to the raw devices and do keylogging on Wayland. Apps need more privileges (sudo) to do that though. But normies will gladly fill in their password when apps ask anyway, so we aren't much better off with security. The various desktop portal protocols help the security situation by providing a way to access computer resources without any password/sudo access, but it means that we need to train people to never fill in authentication prompts anymore, and to educate all programmers to always use desktop portals in their apps instead, and that work is slow and ongoing, but it's definitely being spearheaded by Flatpak (which uses portals for all permissions). It will take time for all regular desktop apps to use portals too. I wouldn't be surprised if it takes half a decade.

I look forward to the day when Wayland is fully usable. It won't be long until it's good-enough for desktop app usage at least. We are mainly waiting on Wayland's Sync v2 protocol which then enables the necessary syncing primitives for use in NVIDIA's pull request for Xwayland so that it can finally be rewritten (updated) and merged. I am also aware that NVIDIA has `COLOR_LUT` on their to do-list for this year sometime. Then the only remaining huge issue will be the massive gaming FPS loss, but I expect that NVIDIA will figure that out within a few years too, but it might be very hard to fix since their Wayland GBM driver is actually a wrapper around EGLStreams driver calls, which leads to unnecessary buffer copying and may be part of the reason for the low gaming FPS on Wayland. In that case, it will be a painful wait while NVIDIA has to make a proper pure GBM driver, something they really don't want to do (they resisted GBM for a decade and only reluctantly created the wrapper method, so getting them to make a pure GBM implementation will be hard). Unfortunately, NVIDIA mainly cares about their corporate Linux customers, who aren't playing games. Only time will tell if they ever fix the Wayland gaming performance, or how long it will take.

In the meantime, X11 exists and is a very mature display protocol which doesn't have any of these huge issues.",linux_gaming

What annoys me is that G-sync doesn't work in Xorg (does it work at all in Wayland?) if you have a dual monitor setup. Instead you have to set the display to clone instead of expand, then it works I think.

I'm so used to G-Sync that I almost can't play without it.",linux_gaming
jfl762v,"No worries. It sounds like you use desktop apps that are compatible with native Wayland rendering, in which case NVIDIA is already close to perfect, so I can understand your sentiment. And Chromium-based browsers recently (at the end of last year) got a bunch of patches that made them very compatible with Wayland. I am pretty sure that screen sharing works nicely in those browsers now (so if you use Discord via the browser instead, you should be able to screen-share).

Unfortunately I use many desktop X11 and Electron apps that aren't ready for Wayland yet. :/

The biggest day-to-day impact for you would be the gaming FPS loss, but it won't matter if your GPU already pushes out enough frames for you to get a comfortable framerate. :)

I will keep revisiting Wayland compatibility whenever I see interesting developments, since I always read the NVIDIA driver changelogs. One thing is certain: They're taking Linux more seriously than ever before. That's still not great, but it's definitely getting better with every release! I am happy with my choice of NVIDIA.

There's also recent attempts to create actual open-source NVIDIA drivers that use the same Mesa framework as AMD's excellent community drivers, so in the future we might all be using open-source community NVIDIA drivers instead, just like the lucky AMD owners. :) It's a big undertaking though, but it's very impressive. Check it out, it's called NVK: [https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html)",linux_gaming
jflb85x,"Yeah, I use kde and the new xwayland screen share bridge for my screen sharing, and I’ve heard of nvk but it’s a while from being complete last I heard.

jflppv1,"Ah, yeah I envy AMD since they can leverage open source developers from around the world to get Wayland features faster. Phoronix even did tests and showed that on AMD, Wayland often gives more FPS than X11 (so the opposite of NVIDIA): [https://www.phoronix.com/review/wayland-nv-amd-2023/5](https://www.phoronix.com/review/wayland-nv-amd-2023/5)

So if your main gaming rig is AMD, you definitely benefit from Wayland there.

Another thing I really like about Wayland is that GNOME's animations are super smooth on Wayland.

It's a bit painful to be born in the wrong time, in the transitional period. I really look forward to the day that NVIDIA fixes the Wayland gaming performance issues in particular. I hope it doesn't take too long, but I fear that it might. But there's gonna be a time when everyone uses Wayland and NVIDIA will be forced to fix these issues someday! It might take a few years if we're unlucky (if it requires a GBM rewrite, which would be a big ouch), so I have to stay patient...

AMDGPU is full of small more or less corner cases that will make the entire GUI session crash or freeze the kernel entirely. I believe Its deep integration with the kernel comes at that price.

It lacks stability in some areas like that (and gives you an idea why people doing any sort of ML related workloads just go NVIDIA since they actually take those matters seriously enough).

After SysRq, ie. Alt + PrintScreen + (I + E) I sometimes get back graphics, but on a tty. If not, I can always still log on through ssh, that's how I checked `dmesg`.

It's very random. Sometimes I will play for hours and sometimes it will happen a few minutes after starting. Different Proton versions actually *do* have an effect on the frequency of crashes. When I switched to Proton Experimental, the crash happened extremely quickly, every time.

git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui (I have also tried setting the head to a more stable version of webui rather than the latest release)

navigate the the folder, try to make a venv with python but it needed a package, so I installed it, rm -rf venv and then redid it.

source venv/bin/activate

I have a piece of software to sell you that has no bugs.

Yes. It is a bug. And it's not tied to which version of Proton is used. The caching problem happens regardless of whatever Proton version is set. Also consider that you can set Proton version _per game_, and yet it still happens for _all games_ installed.

Furthermore the issue came up due to STEAM client version change, not Proton version change.

Now, the point of cache regeneration being triggered due to a new DXVK version is a valid one, but that is done on a per-game instance, and only for ones that have a Proton version with a DXVK update, and not all DXVK updates trigger cache regeneration. Plenty of games out there that favour one version of Proton over another.

I don't mind it too much as if I turn off the 0% fan at idle it keeps the temps at 42 Celsius while not making any noticeable noise so the only real ""problem"" is the power consumption.

Back when I tried to solve this I basically found out that this is due to the VRAM not underclocking at idle with particular (most of the time high refresh or multi-monitor) setups. I think that AMD even claimed that this was expected behavior that guaranteed the proper functionality of high refresh monitors. I have 2x 144Hz monitors, one of them 1440p and the other is 1080p, so it makes sense. I have tried many of the things that are supposed to fix this and none have worked for me, even some of the Windows driver updates that were supposed to resolve this never did anything for me, both on my 5700XT and 6700XT. I really don't care at this point.

EDIT: Just tried to turn off my secondary 1080p monitor and the power draw instantly dropped to 6W.

Another EDIT: Turning off my primary 1440p monitor and keeping the 1080p monitor on and the power draw is still 30W, so looks like my 1080p monitor is the culprit (ViewSonic VX2458-mhd).

I would have had to either compile my own version of Mesa or grab Arch version and use that instead.

I already had some degree of experience with Arch, I installed it into a VM just for fun, so I decided to grab Endeavour ISO and install the GNOME version. It took a while to setup everything but I'm very happy with it, their custom repository has some interesting software in there and the installation process is very straightforward, I'd recommend it if you're already used to Arch. Keep in mind that Endeavour only quickens the initial installation process, everything else needs to be addressed by you, Endeavour pretty much let's you easily get to an X11 or Wayland session fast, but it's mostly a white canvas which you have to then start painting, it's not like Manjaro which is already pre-configured with a ton of software and a pretty GUI. I'd still recommend either vanilla Arch or Endeavour over Manjaro, especially if you're using an AMD GPU. Also Manjaro had some pretty stupid fuck ups lately, but those are not so important in my eyes, what ultimately made me switch was their decision to maintain a castrated version of Mesa without providing a workaround to the community, they pretty much said ""From this day forward, if you're using an AMD GPU, fuck you!"", and I clearly don't like that type of behavior.",linux_gaming

While the other 6 cores (on the other CCD) can run at a higher frequency, but with less VCache.

Now on windows there is a thing called gamebar which can tell the CPU which CCD (or cores) to run a certain application/game on, but there is no such thing on linux (as far as I know). That can cause some problems like stuttering or lower fps then expected when migrating threads from cores on one CCD to another.

I was just wondering how do you find the performance or if you notice any micro stutters in games or anything like that. But since you come from an old CPU, it's more difficult to notice such things. To be honest I will come from a really old platform as well, I have an Intel i5-3570K and it's really time to replace this, so probably I wouldn't notice any problems either I just wouldn't like to leave any performance on the table if I don't have to.",linux_gaming

For my older systems and VMs where I don't feel like dealing with compilation times I run Tumbleweed which has btrfs+snapshots built in.

Like recording at CQP16 with 0 dropped frames looked passable, but when compared to CPU recording everything looks pixely and smokey. Even when I would record at a super high quality preset when using AMF/VAAPI, the quality lacked that ""indistinguishable picture"" I get with plain old CRF14 coupled with the trusty [obs-vkcapture](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture).

But since I upgraded from Ryzen 5 2600 to Ryzen 5 5600x, CPU encoding has not dropped one frame and my quest for hardware encoding on Linux became irrelevant. On Arch I was able to acquire it by using amdgpu-pro driver and installing the codecs via AUR package but I didn't test it very long because it takes too much work to keep it maintained and I just prefer the quality tradeoff of default CPU.

jfa6s33,"I have my cake and eat it too already, I have a 3090 (and I've had one for literally as long as possible, 930 AM on launch morning) and I game at 1440p 165Hz and I have 2 identical model monitors. When you're using a 1000Hz polling-rate keyboard, a 1000Hz polling-rate mouse, and playing on monitors running at 165Hz, my fps would have to drop to below 95-100 before GSync would even remotely benefit me. There's zero tearing and when your frametimes are 1/20th the average gamer's click-reaction time, there's no latency. 

And since I have a 3090, there isn't a game out there that I've found yet that I'm unable to run at at LEAST 115-120 fps without having to go below high quality settings and without having to use DLSS beyond the Quality preset (which we all know often looks identical to or better than native). 

And the day Nvidia fixes the last bug holding up the VRR support in Wayland actually working, hell I don't even have to worry about it and I could use GSync if I wanted. 

I'm glad you gave Arc some business - I hate Intel but we DESPERATELY need a third competitor in the GPU space, AMD and Nvidia have lost their goddamn minds - but I think you maybe did the equivalent of cutting off your finger to get rid of a hangnail - I know your monitors ran at different refresh rates (different resolutions aren't a problem on Xorg so idk what you're talking about there), but using Plasma on X11 you can just set KWin to run at the refresh rate of the fastest monitor, so as far as the user is concerned, both monitors are actually running at their real refresh rates (when really it's KWin painting the screen at 165fps or whatever and your 60Hz monitor can only do 60Hz so you can't tell anyway).

Now, if you're gaming at 4K 144Hz, I would say that yeah, GSync is probably a must, because the 3090 and 3090 Ti were NEVER 4K gaming cards, let alone 8K (lmfao). They were 1440p high-refresh-rate **monsters** that would run anything you threw at them at high framerates at 1440 for 3-4 or even 5 years, and we're already at 2.5 years and it seems that's 100% true. But people are obsessed with this idea of ""4K,"" especially marketing teams. 

Hell even the 4090 isn't a 4K GPU because it requires frame generation to get its wild reported numbers, and the DLSS 3 frame generation is an abomination.",linux_gaming

I wasn't saying that the nvidia didn't have good performance in gaming. I actually said it was great which is why I refused to get rid of it. But unless every game runs at my max refresh (165) VRR does make a difference. There is a disernerable difference even at 100FPS range. And this is coming from 8 months of playing without it.

The whole ordeal was to have a great desktop experience. Yes I know I can run different refresh rates on X11 and electron apps are not an issue on X11, but that doesn't change the fact that VRR will never work on X11 with more than one monitor unless you disable all but one and thats not a solution. This is regardless of what GPU you run. 
As for waiting for nvidia to fix their drivers for wayland... yeah. Wayland released in 2010 and it was just last year that nvidia updated their drivers to make wayland on nvidia even viable. I don't think I want to wait another year or two for them to iron out all the little quirks. 

Yes, we are in full agreement that we desperately need a new competitor in the GPU market and I am rooting for intel on this.

Packwiz downloads all mods automatically for the end user and manages dependencies. Additionally, you have the option to mark certain mods as optional and define whether they are server-side or client-side.

One negative many people might have is that packwiz is a command-line utility, there has been an attempt to create a GUI for it though, check that out as well if you search for something like that.

All of this is ""on paper theorycrafting"" as far as both of us are concerned, so please don't get disappointed with me if this doesn't work. With that out of the way,

So what I would try to do in this situation is hook up a second monitor, and set up a self contained instance of Steam in WINE inside of a Lutris flatpak. Through lutris settings, make sure that a virtual WINE monitor is being used and have it display on a second screen if there's a way to do that (it has been a while since I used lutris). Make sure all of your inputs for a single one of the two controllers you're using are fed to the instance of Windows steam running through that virtual WINE display, inside of lutris's flatpak. Since everything that's running will be inside of a flatpak inside of a WINE prefix which is like wrapping a gift in two boxes, it will likely not clutter or interact with your native Steam install. 


My advice is to test this on like, a spare USB drive with a fresh distro installed to it, because I have NO IDEA how fucky this will get with your udev input stuff and it's best to test this on a self contained environment first before you do it in your main arch install in case this damages drivers or something.

* I was worried that Flatpak Steam would cause conflicts with regular steam because they're both Linux instances of steam, meaning I would have been at the very least concerned about input conflicts in steam input. You say you've run 2 instances of steam but have you done it with the specific context of one PC splitscreen where 2 controllers need to connect to 2 instances of steam? I don't know that from your post. I figured at least with Lutris flatpak, there would be a way to pass through a specific thing.


* I vaguely remembered Lutris having the option to create a virtual desktop of sorts that you can swap to specific monitors, meanwhile I would have assumed you'd only be able to do a thing like that in games that either have to be played in windowed mode to not just display on the primary monitor or specifically have in game options to run full screen on a monitor of your choosing


* Lutris specifically had an option called ""Steam for Windows"" last I used it, I thought that, if there was ever *one reason* to use that at any point, it would be in this specific context.


I get being upset with me if I'm being rude to someone or I'm essentially telling them to fuck off, but all I was trying to do here was help and a simple ""Hey wait, actually that's incorrect information, I have experience with this and OP is better off doing it XYZ way"" would have sufficed instead of being all caps lock, calling shit stupid, and quadruple question marking stuff like I just gave someone armchair medical advice that could have seriously injured or killed them.

1. Playing a lot of games that work flawlessly in Proton out of the box (indie titles, older AAA releases)? Sure, no tweaking required.
2. Trying to run AAA releases day one? Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. For example, with the Last of Us, I had to download a new dxvk-nvapi build to get DLSS to work and I also had to switch over to Proton Experimental bleeding-edge branch in order to get enemy outlines to show up in Joel's listen mode. Other games, you have to configure launch options like RADV\_PERFTEST and VKD3D\_CONFIG=dxr11, etc.
3. Have a lot of crazy, non-standard gaming peripherals? Yeah, you're going to have to add udev rules, tweak some configs, figure out how to compile and install some third-party drivers, etc.
4. Streamer? A lot of popular streamer tools aren't available, so you'll have to look for alternatives. Discord streaming is a mess and you have to use third-party wrappers, etc.

It's great that its working for you. But just like how there are people that prefer Xbox over PS5 and vice versa, not everyone's needs are going to be satisfied by Linux.

My last 2 laptops have had severe issues with very low volume microphone input on windows even when maxed out and software control disabled, funnily enough the microphone volume solves itself if you uninstall the driver, windows then reinstalls it on next boot and you also lose out on vendor specific tweaks to sound - no such issue on any Linux distro I've tried.",linux_gaming

I am finding gaming in Linux a very pleasant experience.  I'm particularly enjoying knowing that I can keep on using my system pretty much indefinitely without being forced to upgrade my hardware by Microsoft ( Windows 11 and Windows 12 mandatory requirements )

In all honesty - performance wise - I could do with a graphics card update I have a GTX1660Ti.  But that's a ""me"" problem not a Linux problem.

Best example is when I wanted some VR thing to work on Windows, but every time a graphics context was created it was broken. The developer didn't know what the problem was, so I debugged it and eventually ended up stuck at a dll I had no access too from the graphics vendor. At that point the only way I could try to find a solution was to just guess at random things being the problem and fix them. 

On linux this would have not been a problem. I could just actually debug the thing and fix it. 

Another example would be the incorrect and inconsistent behavior of the Windows task bar when you set it to hide itself. I cannot look at any code related to that at all so the possibility to fix it is 0, because the issue was reported on Microsofts site years ago and met with a generic ""we are going to look into it!""

Some games just straight up don't work with proton, like ones with anticheat, or just require more configuration. With Dead by Daylight you have to use the Heroic launcher, add some environment variables, and move the anticheat to a different folder.

You can get ~~Origin~~ EA app to install through proton, but if you want to launch it you have to go dig through the wine prefix folders to find the exe and add it to steam.

jf7gl8g,">People always say windows is still easier if you want things to ""just work"" but I always spend way more time fiddling with in-game settings to get good performance on windows than I EVER have on linux.

That's impossible, the only way that statement could be anything but completely false is if you deliberately worded it in the vague way you did, and the above ""comparison"" isn't remotely a comparison at all because a) this ""way"" more required fiddling on Windows vs Linux just to get decent performance was NOT done during the same time period or with the same games or on the same machine, or b) there was some sort of massive user configuration error when you tried to play on Windows. 

There are really only two possibilities:

1. The games you play make up a *very* short list, are way over-represented by indies, or are very old, which would mean that you're not playing games that are remotely representative of what 95+% of gamers are going to be playing, so your experience in that regard is kind of meaningless

2. Your ""Linux vs Windows tweaking needed to achieve decent performance"" comparisons were made in your head without considering whether they were at all valid comparisons or not, and turns out they're not. 

You would have to hand-pick a library of 90% *specific* indie titles and 10% **VERY** specific AA/AAA titles and keep the total number of games below 20 or 30 if there's going to be any chance that Linux actually *outperforms* Windows in gaming with that library overall. Just about every single Linux gamer on Steam with more than 10 games and with any meaningful number of recent AA/AAA games will unequivocally find that their Linux install plays those games 5-15% slower than the same machine running Windows. That's a fact. 

>I always hear people say linux gaming takes more tweaking and is more involved, but personally I have NEVER had to ""tweak"" anything. Is this just people trying to fence sit and avoid unilaterally praising linux, or have I just gotten lucky or something?

Okay so you're SUPER out of touch. I'm as big a Linux evangelist as anyone else on this sub, and that above statement is pure delusion. ""Is this just people trying to fence sit and avoid unilaterally praising Linux""???? No one does that, because Linux has QUITE a few areas where it is outclassed by Windows. The biggest one is obviously game compatibility, considering that no Ricochet Anti-Cheat-ran CoD game, nor Valorant, nor PUBG, nor any other custom ring0 AC game will ever, ever be playable on Linux, and those are among the most popular titles in the world, hell CoD alone was the main topic of discussion by regulators during the MS/Activision/Blizzard merger investigations, that's how big it is. 

But not only that, there has never been a single notable number of people to ever claim what you're claiming, and yet you act like it's some obvious thing. 

But either way, that's not even what anyone is talking about in the first place. In-game settings? No. Tweaks. On Windows, you click play and the game will run and if your GPU supports RT, DLSS, etc, it will be available in the game settings. On Linux, you have to add a ton of launch options to a huge % of Windows games, many of them won't even run without these launch options, and *everyone* has to use launch options to enable RT support in any DX12 game that has ray tracing. The list goes on, and on, and on. It's always been like this. Windows users don't have to ever even think about that stuff. THAT is what people are referring to. 

But still, unless you have some rigged selection of games, there's no way you get better performance on Linux across the board or even on average compared to the same games on the same machine on Windows.",linux_gaming

Most games run decently without tweaking on Linux, but there are times when you need to tweak to get things like launch variables, NVAPI/DLSS, Raytracing (most RT games don't work on Linux since it's very complicated to port DirectX RT to Vulkan RT), fixing game-specific bugs by using a newer Proton/Wine version, upgrading DXVK or VKD3D-Proton to fix rendering API bugs, tinker with anticheat compatibility, picking a working installer method for non-steam games (like Lutris, Bottles, or Heroic) etc.

Oh boy there is no doubt that I have a LOT more hassle on Linux than on Windows. Some games can take HOURS of tinkering to get into a good, properly working state on Linux. Some games don't work at all. Whereas Windows is literally ""install and play"" for all games, and it's way easier in general to install game mods on Windows. But I LOVE Linux and I am willing to accept the -10% FPS (compared to native Windows performance) and occasional extra tinkering JUST to NEVER see that piece of shit Windows operating system again.

Edit: These recent benchmarks show the actual performance difference, if you look at the geometric mean of all game results here:

- AMD RX6800XT is 6.3% faster on Windows and RX7900XTX is 11.1% faster on Windows: https://www.phoronix.com/review/radeon2022-windows-linux/7
- NVIDIA RTX 3080 is 6.5% faster on Windows, and RTX 3090 is 8.7% faster on Windows: https://www.phoronix.com/review/nvidia2022-windows11-linux/8

Despite that, I still don't think it's worth using Windows!

I use SteamTinkerLaunch (STL) which has been configured with a ""default game profile"" that uses the latest GE-Proton, enables NVAPI/DLSS, and enables FSR upscaling. For about 95% of games, that profile works instantly without any extra tweaking. And for game mods, it's still a hassle on Linux but STL has great features for running MO2/Vortex, and for ""run another executable together with the game"" which has been able to inject the mods I need into certain games. So STL takes care of most of my gaming needs.

You get used to the occasional quick tinkering when it's necessary, and it's no big deal. I will never go back to Windows ever again. I love everything about Linux, even the slight inconveniences it has sometimes. It's a much more fun operating system. It's more modern, fresher, lighter, more efficient to navigate, awesome for programmers, fully tweakable, no spyware, etc. I love Linux.

Game tweaks are usually well documented on https://www.protondb.com/ and most of the solutions there work outside Steam too. Like running with specific config file edits to fix whatever is broken on Linux such as ""how to fix gamepads"" or using specific versions of Proton/Wine to get a game to run. But less and less of those tweaks are needed the more Linux gaming evolves.

And things are getting better with every passing month. The recent DXVK 2.0 implementation of Graphics Pipeline Library was a total revolution which now got rid of shader compilation stutters in most games, and I love it! It's awesome to see how the platform is evolving so quickly. I am sure the slight remaining issues we have will be totally gone within a few years. There's absolutely nothing appealing about Windows for me.

I have been using Linux on and off since 1999, and full-time since 2020, and that's thanks to the fact that in the last few years it has finally gotten good at gaming. The development speed of Proton, Wine, DXVK and VKD3D has become absolutely amazing in the past few years.

I was like a Generation 50 Pilot in Titanfall 2, and then July 2020 the wine-eac community build started working and we all went ape shit and several of us ended up exclusively playing Apex, I got like 150 hours in just the 3 weeks the wine-eac build was functional. After that I couldn't go back to Titanfall 2, so when I got my 3090 on launch day (Sept 24 2020), I literally went straight home and spent the afternoon setting up a single-GPU VFIO passthrough VM with Windows on it explicitly for Apex Legends, I literally used that VM every afternoon/evening for over a *year* for no reason than to boot the VM, launch into Apex, and then shut it down when I was done. 

I kept that VM until Apex became playable on Linux with Proton. 

And now I KNOW you're full of shit. Because actually, Apex is **notorious** for it's horrible, HORRIBLE stutter when being ran on Linux while shaders are being compiled. 

And unlike you, I actually logged benchmarks of Apex performance on Windows vs Linux at identical settings, on BOTH AMD and Nvidia (an RX 5600 XT, a 5700 XT, and my 3090), and Linux is 100% unequivocally slower. Not by a lot, it's within 10% and most people could never notice, but stop lying. I've got the numbers.",linux_gaming

jfbglaa,"You really used NVIDIA drivers as a selling point on Linux? They are very well known for breaking on Linux. And I have used exclusively NVIDIA on Linux for years. They have broken several times. They aren't as bad as most Linux users make them out to be but they are a hell of a lot better and more advanced on Windows.

For NVIDIA, you need Windows if you want features such as built-in per-game optimizations created by NVIDIA (which can make a massive performance difference for specific games and are used by default on Windows for both AMD and NVIDIA), or if you want features like Ansel shaders, RTX AI video upscaling (for example in web browsers when watching livestreams), RTX AI-based voice chat cleanup which removes all keyboard typing noises and even removes background music and vacuum cleaner noise, and any other modern features such as DLSS3 and other RTX AI features.

And of course you NEED Windows for both AMD and NVIDIA if you want game raytracing since very few games have working raytracing on Linux (it is extremely complicated to port DirectX raytracing to Vulkan, according to the exact people who are... porting DirectX RT to Vulkan RT).

I was gonna ask ""have you only been using Linux for a month or something?"" but then I thought ""heh maybe he has already written about Linux so I can figure out how long he has been using it, since people who are new to Linux tend to tell the world"".

- It seems like 24 days ago you switched from Windows to Linux again and said that you tend to go into the deep end when you get excited about something, and also asked about a game's compatibility: https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/11quh3o/any_comment_on_eacproton_compatibility/
- The majority of your history is questions about how to Tinker with games to fix them on Linux: https://www.reddit.com/user/temmiesayshoi/submitted/

You are right that Linux is awesome, but you don't have to ignore the fact that a lot of games need tinkering on Linux. You already know that too, obviously.

My post was a great summary of the performance loss and extra tinkering on Linux and especially the hassles when modding games or installing the correct launchers/versions of Wine/Proton, etc. I have edited it to also include the new Phoronix benchmarks that compare Windows to Linux gaming performance to show the performance loss on Linux.

You can also look at Proton release notes which is always an endless list of ""game X is now playable"" and ""fixed bugs in game Y"", which should be enough to show anyone that Linux gaming needs more effort and has much more bugs/glitches than Windows: https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/valve-introduces-proton-next/

To claim otherwise is to dismiss the hard work of the compatibility layer programmers, who are working tirelessly to make games work on Linux. And it isn't always perfect even when they finally make games run.

And then there is https://www.protondb.com/ which is a massive site literally describing how to Tinker with games to make them work on Linux.

Where is a similar, widespread site for Windows? Nobody uses a dedicated tinkering site like that on Windows.

I rest my case, your honor.

Linux is fucking awesome, and gaming is getting extremely good on it, but it's just silly to claim claim that Windows needs more tinkering than Linux, lol. Most game devs don't care at all about Linux, unfortunately. Some games don't run whatsoever on Linux, and it's not just the anticheat games.

Linux doesn't need that kind of fake ""it just works and is better at gaming than Windows"" publicity. It creates the wrong expectations in people. Linux has a million reasons to use it and a million strengths that make it better than Windows. But Gaming is not one of them. Despite that, I am willing to live with the slight pains of Linux gaming and the game performance loss (-10% FPS on average), just to never see the piece of shit Windows again.

Linux finally made me happy with my computer after decades of suffering with the clunky, ancient looking Windows. You obviously feel the same. I am glad you found a home with Linux too!

I have been using Linux on and off since 1999, and full-time since 2020, and that's thanks to the fact that in the last few years it has finally gotten good at gaming. The development speed of Proton, Wine, DXVK and VKD3D has become absolutely amazing in the past few years. Valve finances all of those projects and I am infinitely grateful to Gabe Newell for what he has done for Linux gaming, and Linux popularity in general.

Edit: Nevermind, I just saw your downvoted comments in these threads with everyone else you speak to. You don't listen to anyone. I will just block you to save my time. Have a nice day.",linux_gaming
jfcmbd3,"Oh yeah. Should have read there first. Sorry for being lazy.

jfcynsj,Yeah I get that same issue too. It's a problem with the screen capture method that Discord is using. Have you tried toggling between sharing the whole screen vs sharing just the game window? I've had similar issues with OBS in X11 and sharing individual windows was much more performant than sharing the whole screen.,linux_gaming
jf7kpus,"Lol your reading comprehension isn't the greatest, is it?

Let's say you were right in that statement (you're 100% wrong, especially when it comes to Apex specifically, but still let's say you're right): 

*The shader compilation stutter issues were mentioned* ***explicitly*** *as something the community struggled with SPECIFICALLY with Apex more than any other game for well over a year*. Take literally 100% of that away, and the rest of my comment stays unchanged. Lol talk about grasping at straws. Try reading it again, and you'll see that I made it abundantly clear that **BEYOND** the shader compilation stutter issues, WITHOUT THOSE, Apex still runs 10-15% slower on Linux than on Windows, and there has never been any credible data that contradicts that. 

But yeah no, shader compilation doesn't happen ""once"" in Apex, which makes me think you really don't play it very much, because the maps are constantly changing in and out, old shaders are continuously going out of date and new ones regularly have to be recompiled. That's precisely WHY everyone was so upset until the GPL update to DXVK that came only a month or two ago, because it largely eliminates those stutters during shader compilation. And guess what?! It still runs 10-15% slower on Linux. 

Almost every single Windows game that has been demonstrated to run faster on Linux than on Windows have been VULKAN games that don't require any graphics API translation. Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein Youngblood both run faster on Linux than on Windows (but only on Nvidia). The only exception I've heard of where Linux beat Windows by more than margin-of-error is Nier: Automata on AMD.",linux_gaming
jfd1fnu,"I've tried both, yes. But no real difference I would say.",linux_gaming
jf7ljnr,"Once per map jagoff. Yes obviously when a new map is introduced they get recompiled, I thought that went without saying but I suppose I grossly overestimated you. The rest of your comment was ignored because it was just baseless whinging and ""nuh uhs"". You cant refute ""nuh uh"" because it isn't a point,you just said some shit.

Oh also, you CLAIM to have data, here is some actual data https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/uwnsx1/linux_vs_windows_11_comparison_20_aaa_games/

Over a year old data at that, and linux has improved MASSIVELY over the past few years.

edit : thought I'd dig the hole a little deeper for you https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/secuqv/games_that_can_run_better_on_linux_than_on_windows/ . Again, is this data old? Yes. But, do you REAAAAALLLY think that proton has gotten WORSE overtime? For that matter, even if you don't want to bother with the data, there are plenty of people in that thread all echoing the exact same sentiment. 

I really just don't see this as being up for debate, linux runs games faster. Some games have confounding factors - nothing is absolute - but the general trend is linux is better. One person in that thread even mentioned that due to linux handling processes better Factorio was able to implement non-blocking saves in their linux version, while not able to in their windows version. That may seem like an edgecase but, well, when you have enough edge cases, you realize you don't have any at all. Elden Ring had a very similar ""edge case"" with it's shaders being dropped too early on windows, but kept cached in linux. I already mentioned my Apex Legends issues. In Crysis 3 you need to manually configure your Nvidia drivers in order to fix stuttering that makes a 3090 struggle to run a game for an xbox, buuuut on linux it runs fine. Once you have so many edge cases, they just stop being edge cases and linux becomes the better option.",linux_gaming

jfaixl0,"You can, but whether the game or app you share is going to work on their machine is another story. Bottles didn't exist back when sharing working game prefixes was somewhat common (or at least not unheard of), I even remember doing it myself, tarballing a working Overwatch or Jedi Fallen Order Lutris prefix or something and sharing it with someone cause they were having trouble getting whatever game it was to run on their own...


But it's basically useless now: if a game/app is known to be playable on Linux through Wine and someone can't even get it to work by using Lutris (or bottles if you hate yourself), then it's almost certainly user error on their part (missing dependency, misconfiguration of their Vulkan environment, etc), and that problem will keep any working prefix they get sent from working on their machine. 

Which leads into the main reason you SHOULDN'T do it: because Linux isn't hard to learn, but you can only learn from doing, and sending someone a pre-built Photoshop prefix isn't going to teach them shit except the lesson that they don't have to bother learning how to do anything. What you do instead is give them a numbered list of what you needed to install Photoshop and the steps you took to install and run it. Then they will actually learn a little bit more about their system, and you'll have done them a MUCH bigger favor than you would have done by chewing up their food for them which is what you're talking about doing. 


Oh and if you're confused why I keep saying prefix instead of bottle, that's because that's what it is. A Wineprefix. Bottle is a later ""slang""/casual term for a wineprefix but no one uses it these days except when talking about Bottles the app.",linux_gaming

And ""I'm sure Adobe would be interested to know where you live""?????? Not only is that one of the biggest ""I'm a born snitch down to the depths of my soul,"" its also one of the most objectively stupid statements I've read on here from a while, which is shocking because in 4 years of talking to you on here I've only ever known you to be rather intelligent regardless of how often I disagree with opinions you might voice.

I didn't install Windows 10 because I have only 8GB of RAM and am already struggling for most uses and I think running Windows 10 would further impact the performance.

Now, with all that being said, I barely ever even use Windows anymore, I use Linux for whatever I possibly can and switch to Windows only if I really have to, which is why I'm trying to get this game to work decently on Linux in the first place so I can have one less reason to boot up Windows.",linux_gaming

There are plenty of reasons to use Proton-GE over upstream Proton Experimental, but ""latest DXVK and VKD3D from git"" is literally 100% not one of those reasons.

To answer your question, you **perceive** there to be more devs publishing on Mac than Linux because of the most obvious reason in history: Apple's share of the gaming market has always been MUCH larger than Linux's, and it still surpasses Linux in gaming market-share by a substantial margin to this day.

Where's the confusion? Why would you ever expect any for-profit company to go ""okay we can develop versions of our products for the 4-5 biggest markets which are all around hundreds of millions of users, and then if we have time, we can develop a version for the next biggest platform - oh that platform happens to be Apple's MacOS, which has some of the best brand recognition in the world, and every Mac computer owner is likely to have disposable income? Perfect! Actually no, screw that, we just won't even consider MacOS, we'll act like they don't exist, and instead we'll create a version for Linux - What's Linux you say? Honestly I don't know either, but it's some sort of computer thing. But yeah, we'll develop a native version of our product for Linux, even though our Windows version will already work flawlessly on Linux without us having to do anything""?????

Apple is a bigger name in the **public consciousness** than even Microsoft. Back in the early smartphone days, we came VERY close to ""iPhone"" being equivalent to ""Kleenex."" And as far as the computer (non phone/tablet) market goes, they have held 8-ish percent of the desktop for years, and while their gaming marketshare isn't close to that, it's still more than Linux.

Meanwhile an ASTONISHING of computer-savvy people didn't even know what Linux was until the last year or so, and honestly some still don't.

But, you're honestly mistaken in your assumption that mac is getting all these ports. What ports? Metro Exodus? We got one too, and ours has ray tracing. Shadow of the Tomb Raider? The Mac and Linux ports are both by Feral and they're advertised together on Feral's SotTR site. War Thunder? We have that too.

jfhth5l,"**TL;DR: Less Linux gamers, than Mac gamers. Compatibility issues and too many distros, DE's and WM's to fix configuration specific bugs. DRM & piracy protections, as well as, anti-cheats not working properly or at all.**

Simple, linux gamers (according to Steam Survey, March 2023) are fewer than MacOS gamers. About 0.57% less than MacOS. Although I do personally believe there are more people who game on linux, as not all of these gamers use Steam as their primary game platform. Epic Games and standalone games (e.g. Minecraft) can't be measured that easily. Especially when Lutris and Wine exist. Some statistics might be incorrect as the users machine is probably posing as a Windows computer to play the game. Not always but you get the idea.

It might also just be compatibility/ease of porting a game. See, although we call it Linux, there is over 600 Active Linux Distros, with all different package managers, DE's, WM's etc. etc. and it is just hard to get your game working on the majority of these distros. Some are more plug and play, but imagine a game breaking bug in a specific distro and specific configuration/DE or WM and you have to run around fixing your game for the 0.84% of users that play it. With MacOS it is either supported or not supported. Let's say the game needs at least High Sierra to run. Then boom, anything below is unsupported because it's old or lacks the drivers. Also it has the one and only desktop environment (Finder) where bugs can be easily fixed for all users, because they can only run that certain configuration (plug n' play basically).

Not that simple with linux. Also a lot of DRM and License checking/game security or piracy prevention and anti-cheats outright do not work on Linux and especially on the vast amount of distros. This makes it even less likely for a developer to put in the time to secure it for a small userbase.

Although these are mostly not linux problems and still just a developer made problem, you start to see why you might not consider making a linux compatible game, especially when you are a smaller developer who needs money to survive. Bigger publishers have the resources but they do not care as linux is not a cash cow.

As for your non-CPU problem....

>DXVK_ASYNC=1 gamemoderun RADV_PERFTEST=aco ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 mangohud %command%

What year is it? What are those launch options? Also they're wrong syntax-wise and so you're not getting anything you think you're getting. 

`DXVK_ASYNC` doesn't exist anymore. It hasn't existed in a while, and it never existed on official Proton builds, but now it's gone for all Proton builds. 

`RADV_PERFTEST=aco` literally does nothing, and it hasn't done anything for like.... 3 years at this point? ACO is the default compiler for vulkan-radeon aka RADV. So delete all that shit. 

You also list two commands in there: `gamemoderun ANCIENT_RADV_SHIT ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 mangohud %command%`. You can't use both `gamemoderun` and `mangohud` in the same launch option line. Also, don't put commands in the middle of environment variables. I makes finding broken shit way harder. 

Remove `mangohud` from the line. Move `gamemoderun` to the very end, right before `%command%`. At the BEGINNING of the line, as the first environment variable, do `MANGOHUD=1`. `MANGOHUD=1` works for all vulkan applications. If it's OpenGL, you'll have to look up gamemode's `GAMEMODEEXEC`option to see how to use it to run mangohud, because you can't have `gamemoderun mangohud %command%`. 

And again, delete the RADV and DXVK shit. 

That still likely won't fix your issue completely, but it's one of the worst launch option command lines I've ever seen and you have to fix it regardless, because right now it's just a bunch of words that don't even do shit. 

Your real problem is that you for some reason really want to use a distro that makes ZERO sense with a bleeding edge ***AMD*** GPU. You can't do that.

The PC wasn't really build for gaming (that was just a secondary concern for my free time)

I chose the CPU as i need the multi-core performance it helps a lot when you compile a lot of code and having multiple VMs open. The x3d performs really well and compared to the 7950x it uses less power and it stays cooler. (In theory this should help with the longevity of the CPU as I don't really plan to buy another one soon). The benchmarks online are mainly synthetic and don't really hold a lot to real life workloads they are good to get an idea of what it can do but they should never be 100% of the reason you buy hardware. And honestly I am quite pleased with it at this point. As for gaming I agree the 7800x3d does seem to be the leader for now.

The 7900xtx was more of an afterthought as initially i didn't even want to buy a GPU but the price was very reasonable compared to Nvidia cards of the similar performance and I don't need crazy performance I just want to know I can boot-up a game 5 years from now and be able to get a decent gaming experience out of it for the limited amount of gaming I usually do. That being said while I don't expect crazy performance out of it I do want the performance it's capable of. I know it will take a while for thing to get up to speed with new hardware on Linux I've been using it for about 10 years I don't mind the wait but it does seem that the driver is almost there and maybe i could get some extra performance with a couple of tweaks until things get sorted out.  


As for the launch options I didn't do a lot of research on them just copied some stuff from proton db and some forums thing is they some of them were not that old 2-3 month old. I'm pretty sure you are right about the order of declaration and and read up a bit on the async stuff and indeed it's old but you can still find it suggested on quite recent posts and if you don't really keep up with gaming it's not so clear as to what is the best option.  


The distro is actually pretty nice I was quite surprised. Not a lot of distro make it easy to get the latest changes of some packages without it breaking. And the moment mesa 23.1 gets released and the KDE packages works with it nicely I'm back to my NixOS config so I just wanted something to work quickly. And don't dismiss these new distros like the ones optimized for gaming nobura, garuda or performance like cachyos/pikaos in my experience while they don't always survive the test of time they usually bring some new concepts and ideas that do and will spread to the more ""conservatives"" distros making the ecosystem better all around.

jf5qggs,"The only upside that this would have is that we can compile standalone geometry and tessellation shaders up front, whereas currently we need to compile a pre-rasterization library at draw time.

However, this whole thing comes with some annoying cons:

- The EXT pretends that legacy geometry pipeline stages map directly to a hardware stage, which isn't the case at all on e.g. recent AMD hardware, so a lot of driver magic needs to happen behind our back that we can't really control. EDS3 already has this problem to a degree, shader objects only make it worse.

- In order to help out with that, they introduced the `VkShaderCreateInfoEXT::nextStage` flag. DXVK would have to be extremely conservative here since any given vertex shader can potentially feed a geometry shader, a tess control shader, and a fragment shader. This can lead to increased compile time and memory use, and in practice, any extra work being done would go to waste 99% of the time since the average graphics pipeline only consists of a VS+FS anyway. With GPL it's the opposite, we only ever waste a pre-rasterization pipeline library if tessellation or geometry shaders are *actually used*.

- Shader objects don't integrate with the existing pipeline model at all, it would be a *lot* of work to use this alongside regular pipelines.

- And we have to keep using regular pipelines anyway since shader objects alone straight-up will not achieve the same level of GPU performance - at best, we can expect the performance of fast-linked GPL pipelines, which on RADV can be a solid 10-20% slower. Reason being that *all* state is dynamic, so we'd always get dynamic VS prologues + FS epilogues, and we also lose any sort of inter-stage optimization.

TL;DR the whole thing really just isn't worth it for us. The number of Tess/GS pipelines is generally very low to begin with, the other edge cases where we need to do late compiles would *still* require late compiles since we need to patch shader code, and GPL already solves the stutter problem extremely well for us without any major downsides.",linux_gaming

No. That's why Nobara exists (same with Garuda). There is a set of tweaks that you would benefit from performing on any distro, and you can do them on any distro, but **enabling them** isn't the same on every distro, and the tweaks needed differ based on your hardware, GPU vendor, etc.

 - Somehow he manages to do all that shit in his free time and work a full-time job as an engineer at RedHat. 

 - Created Nobara with basically every sensible gaming-focused enhancement thinkable, something unheard of on Fedora before this.

You:

 - Not a developer at all

 - Have likely never written a single line of code for Proton, Wine, DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, the Linux Kernel, Gamescope, MangoHud, or anything else

 - *Seem* to be relatively new to Linux, or at least Linux gaming (though I do really appreciate your willingness to dive in, that's awesome)


So what exactly are you thinking?

Let me put your mind at ease: Nobara isn't a distribution. It's still Fedora, so ""one person"" (even if that one person is the single most qualified person on Earth for the job) being behind the project isn't any sort of reason to be concerned. It's not like this is Manjaro or Arco or any actual distro based on another where the maintainers HAVE to constantly be working to keep the distro up and running. Nobara is just Fedora with a bunch of presets changed/good shit added. It uses the regular Fedora repos, GE could retire tomorrow and it would change nothing for you, especially since Nobara is 100% focused on providing **install-time tweaks**, and then it stops doing much of anything and becomes Fedora with hours/days of work for the end user already being done for them.

You have to efficiently use the available resources, tools and perks, adapt to the environment, complete procedural quests... otherwise you can’t establish a strong enough colony to set sail for the next one!  
Set sail, and choose wisely! Which island's perk and biome fits your playstyle and strategy the best?

jf63bb2,"""The economic argument for owners is erroneous, but the economic issue is real. Some people write useful software for the pleasure of writing it or for admiration and love; but if we want more software than those people write, we need to raise funds.

Since the 1980s, free software developers have tried various methods of finding funds, with some success. There's no need to make anyone rich; a typical income is plenty of incentive to do many jobs that are less satisfying than programming.

For years, until a fellowship made it unnecessary, I made a living from custom enhancements of the free software I had written. Each enhancement was added to the standard released version and thus eventually became available to the general public. Clients paid me so that I would work on the enhancements they wanted, rather than on the features I would otherwise have considered highest priority.

...

In the early 1990s, companies including Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices combined to fund the continued development of the GNU C compiler. Most GCC development is still done by paid developers. The GNU compiler for the Ada language was funded in the 90s by the US Air Force, and continued since then by a company formed specifically for the purpose.

The free software movement is still small, but the example of listener-supported radio in the US shows it's possible to support a large activity without forcing each user to pay.""

jf63ue0,"Yes, an indie game developer who has spent a year of their life developing said game is going to hand it out for free and make money by ""selling support services""

What game actually makes money on selling ""support services""? I can't name one, this only applies to software packages in general as they have a purpose e.g. make a certain job easier.

SAAS works because businesses would rather have paid support than losing a source of income due to downtime or training issues.

This only works in the case of large corporate structures, not on an individual basis.

The same does not apply for games. Games typically do not make the user any money. Companies typically don't have all their staff playing a game to try make money. 

Games are for enjoyment.

For gaming you want something more up to date so newer games that use newer technologies have said newer technologies that they need to run, and also because performance is generally better on newer stuff although often marginally. 

So to decide the best distro FOR YOU (because again there is no general best distro), I will need the answers to the following questions, and feel free to ask for more information or clarification regarding any of these.

Would you like a distro which has the latest stuff all the time but may be a bit unstable, or something that updates less frequently but is usually more stable?

Would you like a mainstream distro that will definitely work for years and years, or one that is tweaked to make games run as fast and flawlessly as they can but is run by a smaller group and may or may not last?

Are you interested in learning more about Linux and troubleshooting your own problems, or would you rather everything be easy to do and there be a large amount of support.

What hardware do you have?

jfcirv2,"Simple answer there is not one. 

The best distribution for you might be something like Arch Linux, whereas for someone else it might be Ubuntu, technically both of you are using the best distribution.

In both cases, using this example, running either Arch or Ubuntu with the same kernel, drivers, Wine, Proton, etc will not give you any meaningful performance difference between the both of them. 

As for advantages and disadvantages, in what context?

Using the examples again, Arch is a rolling release distribution, so it will receive more frequent updates which may be an advantage or disadvantage, and Ubuntu is more conservative with it's update release cycle. 

In short, choose what is the best option for you, and not what other people suggest or propose is the best for them.

If anyone knows a way to run that game in Heroic, please share it...

Edit: Yeah EA App tries to read the license and fails due to not finding the real Epic Store, there is no fix. https://github.com/derrod/legendary/issues/496

I am gonna have to install the real Epic store in Bottles again, installing the game that way would give me EA App and proper license handling. Sad.

Edit: Apparently it IS possible but I need to link Epic with an EA account and then I can use the real EA App to install those games in Heroic. Found the wiki! https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/wiki/How-to-install-EA-Games-on-Linux",linux_gaming

Most of that guide is about how to link Epic + EA accounts so that the games bought in Epic Store become registered at EA.

The TL;DR of the process is to add EA App to Heroic, with plain Wine as the runner (not GE versions because those don't register the link MIME handler). Then after that Heroic handles the syncing of game licenses from Epic to EA automatically. You can then swap the EA App wine version to GE.

After the linking and syncing is done, it can install those games without hassle.

jf7hb8f,"> Lutris needs the exact same process. Because this isn't about how to run plain EA App games. It's about running Epic Store games made by EA.

Um, yeah I know. I read it the first time. 

Lutris handles that shit infinitely better than Heroic, and always has. If you want an example, take GTA V EGS version. You obviously have to have the Rockstar Launcher to play the game, and I've had the EGS version installed for years and not only did Rockstar Social Club and the Rockstar Launcher get installed automatically from the beginning, they've been kept up to date this entire time, too.

Same with like 3 of my Ubisoft games, The Division 2 for example. It has to download Ubisoft Connect or you can't play the game, obviously. And yet I never once have had to manually force shit. I click Play, EGS installs what I need, I sign in to Ubisoft when the window pops up, the game launches.",linux_gaming
jf7pumr,"Hmm, interesting. I'm not understanding yet. Are you saying that Lutris detects that ""you own Jedi on Epic Store which is an EA App game"" and then installs both Epic Games Launcher AND EA App in that Wineprefix?

How does it handle multiple games that all need the EA App? Do all games get separate Wineprefixes with separate EA App installations, or do they all share one EA App prefix?

The way I understand it, Heroic puts all EA App games inside the EA App prefix (due to that's how EA checks licenses). And it has zero need for the buggy and sluggish Epic Games Store Windows app at all. It runs the Epic portion via Legendary instead. Which is much better.

I just came out from Bottles where I used to run EA App plus Epic Games Store in one Wineprefix (bottle) and I hated how buggy the Epic Store is. The Epic Store launches a million background processes that can easily freeze. I really hate it. That's why I like that Heroic runs Legendary for me, a Linux CLI which replicates EGS without needing EGS.

The only issue is the EA App license linking which that wiki handles.

But I am interested to learn more about how Lutris does this. If you see the Windows Epic Games Store client then it's out of the question for me. I hate that shit. It caused so many issues for me, with freezing EGS background processes and lack of responsive GUI, EGS freezing, failing to auto-update itself, etc.

Edit: Oh Jesus it seems like Lutris uses the official EGS client for Windows. If I wanted that, I would just use Bottles which makes that even easier than Lutris. https://github.com/lutris/lutris/blob/7e873a0621a8ad06cc4c32848efd7b69d66c8e19/lutris/services/egs.py

The reason I switched to Heroic is because I am finally free and don't need EGS anymore.

The only issue is linking EA App account licenses for my Epic Store purchases but that's pretty trivial to do, just following those wiki instructions, so I'll be doing that. Anything to avoid the EGS Windows garbage again.

Edit 2: Someone tried making a Legendary runner for Lutris but got rejected because it was more effort for the Lutris team than just reusing the bloated EGS Windows client. https://github.com/lutris/lutris/pull/2894",linux_gaming

From the point of view of studio, who worked hard on Linux-first design of in-house engine, it was not so fun to maintain. Even though, managed to create directstorage alternative (that boosts steamdeck I/O + FPS by 30%), we're now rewriting the engine to make use of DirectX + Metal instead. Proton just works™ and we don't have to bother with legacy bullshit of X11 or bundle embedded Wayland compositor that runs as window with our game in fullscreen mode to actually make use of advanced features that requires DMA Buffers, subsurfaces (layered windows) and direct-scanout (nothing in the background is rendered, if game runs in fullscreen mode).

Overall, native support is just painful outside of Steam Deck, which is fixed hardware and you as developer don't need any special workarounds for each distro that has either non-standard filesystem hierarchy or some other cases like too old kernel and force-disable io\_uring module  which is used to boost performance a lot when combined with next-gen interfaces used by Wayland.  


Edit: the main adventage of switch from Vulkan to DirectX and Metal, was much better UX for end users and the lack of fragementation (and built-in font rendering...). No one really talks about this, but Vulkan is really fragmented which makes it hard to support wide range of hardware, as many advanced extensions are either not supported by our minimal target (gtx1650) or cause issues on other vendors.

Native Linux game builds tend to ""bitrot"" like all commercial Linux software that is not actively maintained. Most Linux distros are quite a moving target, and while Valve has some compat layers through their Linux runtimes, I don't think the interfaces will ever be as stable as the Win32 ABI.

E.g. a native Linux game released today might still use Xorg and not support Wayland because it's too much work to support both. But in 5 or 10 years, that might be a little unfortunate as Wayland is already pretty common today. The win32-based ""exe"" game can simply switch to Wayland on Linux thanks to Wine (and therefore Proton) currently getting a Wayland backend.

Same story with OSS / Alsa / Pulseaudio / Pipewire, and system libraries in general. It's not a big deal with Open Source software, as people will simply change the code to make it work with the new tech stack if the software is somewhat popular. But it sucks for closed-source software that is no longer maintained.

As the GNU/Linux environment changes in major ways at a relatively high frequency, Wine can adapt to these changes and keep supporting all those Windows-based games on Linux. While native closed-source Linux games eventually stop working. So the Win32 API turns out to be quite useful for Linux gaming in my opinion. :-) If game devs use wine/Proton in their testing pipeline to make sure their game works, that makes it even better!",linux_gaming

Well, Vulkan 1.0 is as old as DirectX 12 which has much better hardware support, since it's fully centralized design and not fragmented extensions where 99% of them are fully optional. Such fragmented design also leads to vendor specific extensions, mostly related to raytracing or fancy features.

Given this issue, the only scalable way to maintain a Linux game release that trly supports all available distros would be flatpacks, snaps and appimages.

Now, that may not be super odd to you at first, but one of the main reasons I got my RTX 2060 was to undervolt the snot out of it and get my PC below 100 watts of power consumption when gaming, but unfortunately, that didn't work out terribly well when I found out there was really no user friendly software for applying a power limit, let alone a stable undervolt.

Other than that, there were a couple of interesting features I was looking into, like Waydroid, which are non-Nvidia exclusives, in addition to Wayland if it ever gets mass adoption and so on.

So with that in mind, I've also been pulling my hair out because I've been doing a variety of things with AI lately, and have not been able to get my RX6700XT working under ROCm for a variety of tasks (though some of them worked surprisingly well!), to the point where I seriously considered just getting an Nvidia GPU again.

And when I thought about everything it would entail, I just couldn't switch back, even when it took one month (!) of troubleshooting to get a single AI technique working for me. If you're not doing anything with AI, I can't imagine a reason to stick with Nvidia under Linux.

On the hardware side, though, you may want to consider waiting a bit. The 2070 is a pretty respectable GPU, and the only reason I would retire it is if you wanted to use your laptop very differently, like...If you couldn't run it on battery at all ATM, but could manage it with a more careful power limit, or something like that.

I suggest waiting, because depending on where RDNA 3 drivers end up we could see a situation where one of the RDNA 3 GPUs ends up being very performant at low power use, and based on AMD's strategy ATM (They repackaged Rembrandt APUs as the 7035 series, have the Menodocino APUs in the low end, they have the Phoenix APUs in the upper high end, and Dragon Range in the top end, giving I think a mix of 3-4 different nodes), it's kind of telegraphing that they're expecting to get their mobile SKUs into a ton of different laptops in very short order.

I suspect that means you'll have a very good selection of AMD laptops over this summer, and while I can't promise anything on the price, laptops are a bit more personal than desktops, and being able to get the right laptop can sometimes matter more than the specs, so I wouldn't buy right now while options are more limited, personally.",linux_gaming

There is also isw (ice-scaled-weasel) which can set it but it doesn't explicitly support newer MSI laptops, so it takes a bit of work to make work, and is effectively abandoned and could break at anytime.

The other warning for MSI is as someone else that has a MSI laptop, the left Win key, at least on my last two MSI laptops, is instead a function button.

The reason? AMD drivers are terrible. On Windows, too. Almost nothing works entirely correctly. I know that's a complete contradiction to what everyone else is saying, but it's my honest-to-God experience, alright?  

On Windows I can't get VR to work because the drivers won't allow the display in it to be in direct mode, so it becomes a PnP monitor and everything breaks. The software also doesn't work (says there's a driver version mismatch, but that's wrong).

But, more importantly, on Linux there's a lot of problems as well. First and foremost, AMD does not save KDE even though they say it does. (It does help though...) But ultimately it's still flickering, it's still leaving broken trails with blur under the cursor, it's still got misalignment on the panels, Latte still flickers, and Freesync is still broken (cursor moves -> it turns off, also in full screen games), and on top of that there's rendering artifacts in VR, and frames come out half-rendered if your framerate goes below the minimum refresh rate of the monitor insead of duplicating the previous, complete frame, which causes a sort of flickering.

I switched TO Nvidia originally because AMD was frankly unusable on Linux back then. That was still in the fglrx days, when Vulkan didn't exist and ATi (which was already owned by AMD but hadn't changed its name yet) only half-supported an old version of OpenGL. Eventually, AMD redesigned their drivers, but it still took a long time to get to a point where it was anything useful. And Nvidia just worked. 

Nowadays though, it's just a great experience. Especially since I use multiple monitors, and if you want to mix and match refresh rates, maybe even resolutions and have only one monitor that supports Freesync, you need Wayland. And Wayland on Nvidia is just not there yet. Their drivers still need some work. Since switching to AMD, my entire desktop experience has been so much smoother, less choppy. Never had problems in games with Nvidia though, but the desktop experience was just not as good. Nvidia does have nice features that AMD doesn't have, or at least that AMD doesn't do as well, but this overall basic experience is much more important to me. And AMD just does that part better. 

Basically, driver support convinced me to switch to Nvidia, and driver support convinced me to switch back to AMD.

My opinion is, yes, switch to AMD. But there are some nuances such as CUDA and AI, DLSS, raytracing thy could convince you to stick with Nvidia. But in my opinion, AMD is the way to go.",linux_gaming

jf4s8kj,So the thing about working with the Linux distribution and Nvidia Graphics drivers is that you have to pick a distribution that has Nvidia support. That and if you're also comfortable with working with the Nvidia support end of it then you can use Linux easily. But the thing that I found about Nvidia versus AMD is that I didn't see a substantial change in performance but I found that using an AMD card required no fuss whereas Nvidia could cause problems. That being said I see a lot of user reviews from people with Nvidia graphics cards on proton DB that seem to have few to no issues. So if you like your current laptop with Nvidia graphics then keep it. There's games that don't run as well on AMD graphics cards and there's games that don't run well on Nvidia cards.

jf215dp,"Yeah AMD's discrete GPU game might be great but their CPU and APU game isnt as perfect.

It seems that time usually fixes it. My 3500u eventually got proper support, and then the regression they added to the kernel that killed it's ability to idle was fixed a few months after that. My rembrant doesnt freeze very often at all and it's only triggered by youtube videos these days. Its been a while so fingers crossed that the combination of firmware, bios, kernel, and mesa updates along with one firefox tweak have fixed things, but I bought this thinkpad last summer and it's not like the 6xxxu series was new when I did. 

I think I'll still favor amd over intel and nvidia, especially since intel is playing around more with its architecture again and it seems things arent perfect for team blue either these days, but it is worth pointing out that AMD doesnt always equal perfection.

Another thing is if you stick with a more stable distro and dont mind staying on x until nvidia finishes ironing out its stuff, the proprietary drivers probably wont be as big a hindrance for you. In fact it means that you have support for proprietary nonsense like hdmi 2.1 and nvidia does have better encoders for video, and if your distro of choice is like fedora and opensuse and stops building mesa with the ability to decode h.264 video then you do save a few extra steps.

ROCm is actually pretty good for running inference (especially on the RDNA 3 series), it's mostly just that training is fairly difficult because many of the common scripts out there have a ton of optimizations that are Nvidia exclusive, so you end up having to write out a bunch of the stuff yourself.

Plus, I actually learned a bunch while I was banging my head against a wall to get ROCm running, lol.

But other than that, you can in the short to medium term just rent Nvidia GPUs in the cloud when you need to do training.

jf3t74q,"Plus I'm assuming your laptop is supported by OpenRazer? That's a big upside if so. 

I can't speak much on hybrid graphics laptops, but as someone who has been building their own desktop gaming rigs for 4 years exclusively for Linux, I started with an RX 580 cause I'd heard all the approaching-misinformation community ""wisdom"" regarding NV GPUs. I never bought an Nvidia GPU and went Vega Integrated-> RX 580 -> RX 5600 XT -> RX 5700 XT. That winter, spring and summer 2020 that I spent on RDNA 1 opened my eyes to how abysmal AMD's Linux GPU division really is: its undermanned, features for new cards don't come to Linux for months after launch, serious bugs go ignored even when affecting thousands of users, and it really seems like the entire `amdgpu` kernel module support/bug report staff amounts to 3-5 people. 

Meanwhile, their Linux CPU division, while also sub-par, is INFINITELY more robust and competent, to where I've had months-long email exchanges with lead devs in charge of major projects for AMD CPUs on Linux (most recently regarding amd-pstate).

So even though I knew by June 2020 that RDNA 2 would match Ampere in rasterization, I decided that since this would be my first flagship GPU, I was not taking the risk of going AMD, and I camped out at Micro Center for 26 hours to get an EVGA XC3 Ultra RTX 3090. I get literally every feature I want, RT performance is fantastic, DLSS 2.X works flawlessly and I can use FSR if DLSS is unavailable. NVENC is INSANE, Optix/CUDA blow my mind when running Blender benchmarks, I've owned the same GPU for 2.5 years and there still are only 4 GPUs in the world that are faster in any meaningful way and theyre all RDNA 3 or Lovelace, and I refuse to participate in either of those generations given how anti-consumer then pricing is. 

I game at 1440p 165Hz, and there is not a single game I've found that doesn't get me at least 120 fps on high settings with either no DLSS or just DLSS Quality. Doom Eternal @ Ultra Nightmare, 1440p, RT on and DLSS quality gives me 200 goddamn fps. 

I really lucked out by timing my HW upgrades to where in fall 2020 I sold my 5700 XT for more than I paid for it brand new, sold my 3800X, got a 5900X and a 3090 and spent 2 years with the best gaming/light workstation build you could have, which is SUPER rare, usually your HW would be surpassed massively within 12 months. 

Tangent aside, Nvidia had day one drivers for my 3090 before I got home at 10 AM on launch morning, and there was no AMD bullshit like ""no OC support yet, no RT support, must be on the latest development Mesa build and the latest RC kernel.""

Unfortunately EVGA is gone now, and they were a good 30% of the reason for how happy I am with my decision. Their RMA process is unparalleled, and the only companies that come close, like Logitech and Corsair, don't make AIB GPUs.

But ignore anyone here spouting 6 month out of date info about Wayland, NV Wayland is equal to AMD Wayland minus the final nv-settings and VRR support. I use Plasma on Xorg and recently tested CP2077 on there vs Wayland, performance was identical and unlike https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/issues, both the open-gpu-kernel-modules issue page and the developer.nvidia.com forums are regularly visited and updated by non-low-level Linux devs. Erik Kurzinger is heavily involved in Wayland development as well.

For hybrid laptops, your distro and DE make all the difference. Pop OS is a big standout, and Arch plus KDE gives you a ton of easy ways to interact with Optimus. 

But here's some serious advice. Do NOT go with a gaming laptop next time around. You pay 3X more money for 1/2 the upgradability and 1/2 the power. For 2500 USD you can build a kiiiiiiler gaming desktop AND buy a very solid laptop for on-the-go non-gaming stuff. Like I have a killer battlestation with 2x 1440p 165Hz monitors, a G502 Hero/Glorious Model D- (I go back and forth), Corsair Mechanical gaming KB, 32GB RAM, 2TB Gen 4 WD Black SN850X NVME, 2x TEAMGROUP MP34 Gen3 1TB NVME, 2x 1TB Samsung 870 QVO Sata SSD, X570 Taichi, in a Phanteks P500A-DRGB case and a Corsair RM1000x PSU AND I snagged a Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 touchscreen laptop with a Ryzen 5 4500U (6 cores), 500GB NVME, 16GB RAM, fingerprint reader, on eBay for 277 dollars, retails for 750, and eBay buyer protection is rock solid. 

And if I wanted to game away from home, NVENC is plenty good enough, or hell you could just not go so high end on the desktop and get a super solid laptop like mine AND a steam deck for less than a modern gaming laptop. Just go 3070 Ti + 5800X3D or 7800X3D, B550/650 motherboard, some slightly lower tier case like an H510 Flow.

Hell, I made a quick PCPartPicker list for you: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/WynkpH

5800X3D, 1TB Gen4 NVME, 1TB 870 EVO, B550 Tomahawk, 32GB DDR4-3600, 27 inch 144Hz 1440p monitor (a good one), Seasonic PSU, Fractal Design Case, and an RTX 3080, for 2000 USD. Add 300 for a midrange refurb/good condition eBay laptop, 500 for a Steam Deck, and that's 2800 USD. Meanwhile JUST A LAPTOP that could game within the same tier as a desktop 3080 1) doesn't REALLY exist and 2) would be 4500 dollars or more and that's without the upgradability.

The game can't really know how far shader compilation has progressed since i'm pretty sure Create*Shader() calls in D3D11 pretty much return immediately and then the compilation happens in worker threads, so only DXVK, which does the actual compiling, can know the progress. And yeah, shader compilation happens 100% on the CPU.",linux_gaming

Stuttering to the point where the game is basically unplayable until shader compilation is finished.

GE-Wine implemented a few OW2 specific fixes a while ago, but most people can't use that because of [this bug](  https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/126kkgb/protonge_journal_geproton753/je9suaw/).

So we are stuck on an old GE-Wine version which has a older version of dxvk that writes invalid statecaches ( according to a dxvk main dev ).

Trying to cover all the bases here: did you `apt update && apt upgrade` after adding the PPA? That shouldn't install proprietary drivers for an AMD card though. That would be downgrade in the case of AMD for gaming anyway.

Also, I know this doesn't exactly help solve the issue, but after reading some of the other comments here I want to add that I'm playing this game at 120+ FPS with an AMD 6800 XT card without any issues with plain Proton experimental and only `gamemoderun %command%` for launch parameters, so I don't think the card, the framerate, the proton version or the launch parameters are what's causing the issue here.",linux_gaming

It's also mentioned that the fixes from Nobara solves most stuttering or stuff and I'd believe that.

If I can guess I'd think you're not using the correct NVIDIA drivers for some reason or not running ProtonGE/WineGE or not running DXVK at all (e.g. running it at Wine's default implementation for DX11 or something).

Or also, something like graphics cards downclocking for some reason. Could try gamescope and setting profiles, dunno.

Do you also get some graphical glitches/weirdness? If yes that'd definitely look like DXVK isn't working well.

No. Your CPU is not too slow for FF14. But you're running a modern high-end 12-core gaming CPU with what is now an entry-level GPU. Have you never heard of balancing your system? 

A 5900X with a 2060 on a gaming rig is like if I paired my RTX 3090 with an i3-9100F. It's really, *really* stupid, and it goes against literally every single expert's advice: Every part in your system should be balanced according to your use-case. If you are going to buy a high-end CPU, then you better be able to afford a sensibly-matching GPU, otherwise you can't actually afford the high-end CPU, because you can only buy it if you sacrifice a gigantic amount of performance elsewhere. 

You now have a CPU that can literally run any single game in the world from 1080p to 4K and be able to be paired with some of the fastest GPUs in the world, and yet you paired it with a GPU that can't even run new AAAs at 1080p at 60fps without DLSS/FSR.

My recommendation just find a distro with kde install (probably Debian base because you have experience with PopOs) and go from there.

Steam work out of the box you just need the proprietary NVIDIA drivers and Vulkan drivers
(Lutris wiki is your best friend https://github.com/lutris/docs or you can find a video on YouTube to help you). 

Epic games and GOG use heroic game launcher. For free games that use third party launcher see if you have them available on steam our just use Lutris.

PS3 you have RPSC3 package in some distro or just use the app image.

Good kde distro (my opnion):

jf044yf,"Valve has the advantage of being able to tie the Steam Deck to the Steam store. Sure you can use other stores on the Deck but it's not nearly as neat and integrated as Steam. 

A hardware manufacture like Asus can't tie their device to a single store, not like Valve. Epic or EA or Xbox games would be expected to work just as well Steam without having to setup something like Lutris or manually setting up the launching through Steam.",linux_gaming
jf1xxb7,"While the ""ideologist"" in me is hoping for the ASUS Ally to fail, part of me is genuinely curious on how it will fair and how that will change (if it will change) the ~~handheld~~ portable gaming pc market.

I think, as the others have wrote, Valve's ace in the hole is that they own the store, so they are generating additional income after the sales of the devices.

However what is also interesting, that the ""gaming PC/laptop"" market does exist. I absolutely don't have the numbers but my guess is that the non-steam-deck explicit gaming PC sales even without counting the ""I build my own"" crowd is still rather large. But are usually not counted as ""consoles"" by any metric, but the Deck kinda is, and it sort of broke how we look at its Windows running counterparts. ... I wonder if lets say next year Valve came out with a non-handheld (let that be an all-in-one pc or just a box), more powerful ""Steam Deck"" that comes with a controller would that be considered kinda a console too?

I think, Steam OS really did change the reception of gaming on Linux a bit. However I also think that ""we are not there yet"". If Valve came out with a desktop Steam OS device but with a keyboard/mouse not a controller, the 90% of potential customer base would still cry why isn't this thing just Windows. (Even if lets say the default UI were more mouse/keyboard oriented then the current gaming mode is.) And this would be even more prominent if its not even from Valve without the now ""accepted"" Steam OS, but some other Linux distro with maybe a gaming optimized mode.

So.

I think for any gaming PC currently be able to succeed with Linux they, as the Deck, have to muddle the waters and target it to compete against either the Deck directly (so portable/hybrid), or against actual consoles not ""gaming PCs"" at the moment. However for it to be competitive it would have to be in similar price ranges to either the Deck if portable or current gen consoles. For that to happen, then some kind of service that generates additional revenue is required. Therefore I think either Valve need to create some kind of ""franchise"" agreement, that other manufacturers can buy in to use the Steam OS brand, and they get a tiny fraction of the Steam purchases made on their machines. Or some other ""big"" store or multiple stores should create a device together with a hardware manufacturer, with a similar deal. 

One more point of contention is proton as a platform. In theory proton is just wine built together various tools to turn dx calls to vulkan calls and that's it. While wine is a generic reimplementation of win32. However AFAIK both wine and proton has hacks and workarounds baked in for certain apps/games. And proton is currently very clearly under Valve's umbrella. So if you want to make a Linux pc with baked in compatibility for ""all the"" windows games that work on the deck, you need rely on Valve to keep up with proton. With Microsoft (a mostly impartial party for this question) you can mostly rely that they don't intentionally brake games, because that would imply that they intentionally broke part of DirectX or the win32 api. Where as Valve in theory could just deny a pull-request to proton, with some fake reason that its not well-formed or would brake another compatibility.

So if another player wants to appear on the scene they might either need to do some behind the scenes dealing with Valve, or be ready to fork and manage their own version of proton, unless proton explicitly goes to a non-profit umbrella with hands of multiple competing parties in in the style of the Linux Foundation. 

So if Steam OS brand does not become a ""freeform"" franchise with service revenue for the manufacturers or proton does not become more clearly independent I think big-name device manufacturers will still likely rather stay with Windows or lets say choose Android as their platform. And its an interesting question on how successful they can or can not be in their segment.

tldr:

IMHO Probably other non-Valve successful Linux handheld/consoles in the shortterm will not happen unless either Steam OS becomes a franchiseable brand and/or Proton becomes an independent platform from Valve.",linux_gaming
jezuq16,"The reasons we haven't seen Linux running consoles have come down to 1) availability of games. it's hard to make a new console and convince devs to make games for it and 2) someone needs to be willing to sell it at a loss. Fortunately, the same exact math applies to the steam deck, and (1) will be solved over time with just the deck existing. I wouldn't be surprised if valve releases a first party Linux console at some point. They would make a killing on PC gamers that want a hassle free TV gaming experience, but don't want to re-buy their games. 

It's possible that valve doesn't extract enough money from from it's users after the fact (no subscriptions/repurchasing) to sell a console at a compelling price point, but it's also worth noting that SteamOS is probably dirt cheap for valve to maintain compared to the PS/Xbox platforms.",linux_gaming

I'm not 100% sure about the newer AMD GPUs, but I have a couple late model Intel laptops (13 series, Iris Xe graphics) and they are rock solid. Everything pretty much works, including excellent graphics support and hardware video encoding/decoding. I have a desktop machine with an older RX550 card and it works fine with the Mesa driver and also video decoding (also: Steam Deck), so I'd expect the same from a laptop.

However, that's not the full story. I had a problem with an ASUS laptop not too long ago that used an Intel 12th gen CPU, but had problem with missing ACPI table entries. So the built-in speakers didn't work. There was a driver for them, but because the driver didn't know how to configure the powered amplifiers, it refused. It worked fine on Windows, just not Linux. That laptop also didn't suspend properly, and the battery would drain after a few hours in suspend. Also, I have a cheap Gateway laptop from Walmart that needed a BIOS tweak for the crappy trackpad to work. So it might not be a walk in the park, depending on which devices are actually installed in the laptop.

Ending on a good note, my Yoga 9i runs Ubuntu with near 100% support. OLED ""backlight,"" sound, trackpad, camera and WiFi all work fine with no tweaks.

Yeah, I have a Switch Pro controller clone. Looking at the manual I found that there are several types of protocols, but it's not fully explained.

\[1\] This is precisely why there was a big kerfluffle about D3D 9 being slow/software/horrible/etc on Intel ARC, it implements \*everything\* as a sort of GPGPU application, so Intel needed to invest a bunch of man hours into tuning up their D3D9 program to get decent performance in old games.

DXVK is arguably a better long-term solution because it's more backend agnostic. There's Vulkan support more places than Mesa runs.

The mine was very dark at times, hard to see, and the interaction with going back to a past mine was weird, as you couldn't see the old part of the mine unless you re-mined that area, but you could drop miners anywhere you want in the old mine by guessing blindly.

Occasionally there were slivers of dirt left when mining.

Obviously a tutorial would be helpful, but not expected for an alpha.

Prices on items *before* making them would be helpful, at the very least after making the item once (if you want to hide the price of items you haven't made).",linux_gaming
jep8qe8,"I tried it, and initially had no idea what to do, but stumbled my way along and got mining.  After I crafted my first item, I had $10, but when I went back to the mining site, I placed my mine, then tried to cut down a tree for $10, but when I clicked the button, nothing happened.  Tried clearing a mine site instead, and it did nothing as well.  The next day, I chopped a tree and cleared a mine before placing my mine, and it worked.  Is it supposed to work this way?

I'll play some more later and pass on more notes.  Worked on 1920x1080, but 2560x1080 had issues.",linux_gaming

Not a single console error or warning. Utterly boring alpha build for a dev test :)
  
Only thing that wouldn't work due to unknown reasons was above ground resource clearing such as tree cutting. If i clicked on the axe icon the ui tooltip would display but pressing the ""collect resource"" button did nothing.  
  
I had earned $10 from crafting the ring and selling it once and could not cut a tree to earn logs to progress further.  
  
Also considering the prices of various upgrades I hope the sell prices of items is more than $10 further into progression because earning $200 for an upgrade $10 per item sold risks becoming less satisfying.

jeqdmxw,"I also got a core dump on the first launch, and it didn't resize textures correctly as my tiling window manager changed the size of the window.

On the second launch, it resized _better_ but still looked odd at some window sizes.

I found the interface a bit confusing; I expected the ""Craft It!"" button to start the craft.  I suggest using the verbs ""select"" or ""choose""' instead of ""craft"" there -- especially since there *is* a ""Craft"" button that DOES start the craft in the middle of the screen.

When trying to remove trees or wells, if I had $10, I could not purchase a $10 removal.  But, if I had $20, I could purchase a $10 removal and still have $10 left.  I suspect there's a `<` that should be `<=` or vice-versa.

I think there needs to be better feedback of where a miner/tool can be placed.  I spent 60% of the first ""day"" trying to place miners before I had placed my mine entrance; I didn't realize it would be required, and didn't interact with it early.  Even if a prompt / tutorial can't be done, perhaps relocating the icon that activates entrace placement could help.

Remove tree/debris ""dialogs"" don't go away if you open another one.  They also don't provide *any* feedback when they can't be purchased; the button looks ""clicked"" but nothing happens.

I find the scroll bar confusing.  Even if you like how swipe scrolling works on Apples devices, that's for when you are moving the ""scrollable content"".  When interacting with a scrollbar, then scrubber *should* mimic the viewport; moving the scrubber up moves the viewport up (and the content ""down"") -- your scrubber/scrollbar moves ""backwards"".

It's probably too early in the creation process to even mention, but the balance feels off.  Assuming this is the game play loop you settle on, you probably want to have *some* upgrade that can be purchased after the first day of mining.  I wasn't able to find one, if it exists, and the first day was not an experience I wanted to repeat several times without change.

I hope you keep working on it until you are happy with it; it seems like there's some effort and heart put into it already.",linux_gaming

jexbayt,"Here are some of my insights, maybe you could add some of them as quality of life improvements:

* **Hotkeys for miners** \- I'm constantly trying to press buttons 1-5 because I played similar games and they had hotkeys for placing objects or for interaction.
* **Timer for license** \- I think it would be nice to have a timer for the license, I know that you can watch how it gets darker and darker, but it's not that accurate.
* **Search for new licenses freezing** \- when I press search for new licenses, the whole application freezes until it ""finds"" new licenses.
* **Miners dig the path that has already been dug** \- I think miners should just go further if the path is clear. I tried with the worm and with two miners crossing each others path. Every time the miner which is going through empty space - digs the empty space, recognizes it as an obstacle.
* **The drill** \- the drill could yield more ores since it's a more refined technology than the classic pickaxe.
* **Crafted item rarity** \- maybe you could add more rarities for the crafted items, each rarity to have different price - more refined (higher rarity) items could be sold for more money.
* **Miners going from one side to other** \- miners could start on the other side of the diggable area when they reach the end of one the sides of the map (right - left), so they could continue to mine there, discovering new ores like that.
* **Menu** \- menu at least with an audio options (I saw you are already working on that)

These are my suggestions for now, I like the game and I will play it even more. I know that all of these stuff could bring some imbalance to the game economy, but you can balance them later I'm pretty sure. :)",linux_gaming

Seriously? No.

That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. 

Your logic is inherently flawed in SEVERAL ways: 

 - Completely ignores the differences between having the compositor allow tearing in one full-screen window vs the entire desktop. The latter might not even be possible without a shitload of work, but even if it WERE possible, it would not be AT ALL the same thing as the current tearing updates protocol, so it would have to be a completely new/rewritten addition/new protocol altogether. u/Zamundaaa you can correct what I've gotten wrong, or elaborate if you choose since you're the main expert (and the author of the protocol and a main KDE Wayland dev). Don't feel obligated to step in though.

 - Every possible option that is technologically possible should be available to users - which is 100% the core foundational stance behind your entire argument. That would make Linux entirely unusable OVERNIGHT, for every single desktop user there is, from the strongest power user to the freshest Linux convert. There would be THOUSANDS of menus and toggles and options and settings for every single aspect of the entire system, to the point where a ""simple/advanced"" menu toggle wouldn't even begin to be usable. Especially when 90% of these options would have not a SINGLE sane use-case in any universe. 

 - KDE should allow you to do whatever you want and give you the option to enable things even when they are literally completely pointless. Well the thing is, no. That's the entire point of open-source. If you want to add your stupid functionality, ***FORK IT***. That's literally the entire point of FOSS, for better and for worse. KDE has absolutely NO responsibility to spend very limited time and development resources on attacking edge-cases that don't even qualify as edge cases, but you are also MORE than encouraged to add the functionality yourself. Nothing is stopping you. Go look at the history of the `kwin-lowlatency` project. Parts of KWin were lacking in latency/performance in one dev's opinion, so he implemented KWin-lowlatency as a replacement for KWin, and it garnered widespread use over a period of a couple years. It's now dead, because KDE has effectively caught up to or exceeded what KWin-lowlatency was trying to achieve, at least to the point where maintaining a fork was no longer useful.

LINUX GAMING IS BUILT AROUND PEOPLE COMPILING THEIR OWN KERNEL JUST TO CHANGE THE SCHEDULER

***EXACTLY***. If you want to change the behavior of KWin, ***COMPILE YOUR OWN BUILD OF KWIN WITH THE CHANGE YOU WANT***, literally just like the people who compile their own kernels. 

Also, by your logic you should be EQUALLY in a hissy fit over the Linux Kernel not including any options for CPU schedulers other than CFS. The only way to add support is to compile your own kernel using a PATCH from a **THIRD-PARTY** that enables support for additional schedulers. I've been compiling my own kernels (and many many KWin builds) for years, it seems you have no understanding or grasp of what you're even talking about or how embarrassingly full of logical fallacies and double standards it is. 

Just like Linux won't offer an option other than CFS but you can add others yourself, you can add your literally 100% useless option to KWin yourself, it's not the responsibility of the KDE devs in ANY way whatsoever. It's not some toggle they're holding back on purpose.

Also the logical conclusion of his actual argument is that ""Every project should be required to spend development time and resources on enabling every possible option regardless of how stupid it is, the user should have the choice.""

The user does have the choice - If you want your ""tearing desktop"" so much, use Xorg and disable the compositor, or figure out how to add this hypothetical functionality that doesn't even exist AFAIK within Wayland or Plasma, and just patch the source and build KWin yourself, which takes MUCH less time than compiling the kernel.

It might also be useful for us to provide all the information Steam support asked for. So far, this is a complete mess.

I renamed my Steam library something else then I told Steam to make a new library then  I used Dolphin to copy all the files and directories from the old library to the new one. Now Steam can see the games again. I suspect the steam cloud sync got a hiccup and messed up the link so badly that Steam couldn't see the library so it couldn't even try to fix it.,linux_gaming

Valve doesn't use upstream Wine. They use their own fork: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine

And if you look at the experimental 7.0 branch: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/tree/experimental_7.0

It's constantly being updated and doesn't match upstream Wine 7.X at all. 

That's the whole point of the fork. They don't have to follow merge windows, they don't have to wait for shit to clear wine-staging, they can add patches that only affect Proton/Games running inside Steam, etc. 

Also, Wine doesn't do major version bumps like say, the Linux Kernel does. Linus only chooses to move to a new major revision when he feels enough has changed to necessitate it. Wine moves to a new major version every single year, no matter what. 

New Proton versions were WAY more important back when we just had 3.0, then 5.0, and no Experimental. Now that the development process and the cohesion has matured, Proton Experimental is going to run any game that you can run on Linux, 99.9% of the time, and when Proton 8.0 comes, it's gonna basically be ""mainlined 30 things from Experimental, rebased wine-valve on wine 8.0,"" and that's it, but go find some big feature in 8.X that you want in Proton and I bet you if I go look in the source, Valve already added it to their fork.",linux_gaming

and VKD3D from here:

VKD3D are the D3D12 libraries. But I don't remember where I got mfplat.dll and the d3decompilers from, which are often used by DX12 games.

Also, you might wanna run the game in Window Borderless but if you try to do it from the game settings, it crashes, so you have to force it manually: 

/home/$user/.wine/drive_c/users/rado/AppData/Local/Teardown/options.xml and change Line 4 to read <mode value=""2""/>. I've discovered that some games simply run a lot better and smoother in Borderless Window mode than in Fullscreen, especially when it comes to linux.

As for the ""How to optimize Minecraft?"". The answer partially depends on the version of Minecraft you're running (see point 1), but main points are: 

1) As others suggested, mods like Optifine/Sodium are almost must-have for any version of Minecraft and are relatively easily installed; however, Sodium requires Fabric modloader which is not available for older versions like 1.7.10. 

2) A very important option in graphic settings is ""**mipmap**"" which, when set to anything above 0, can tank FPS massively (for me it drops FPS from \~200 to \~70). I've heard that it's only/mainly on AMD cards, but try changing that nonetheless.

In older versions of Minecraft, think Release 1.4.7 from 2012, the sounds are packaged/shipped differently from more recent versions. Sounds are downloaded from some kind of file server and the link to that server is kind of hard-coded into the game. 

So what happened there at some point (and I'm not sure if Mojang ever fixed it) is that the link died and the game would not download any sounds, spamming console with ""`ERROR:` `s3``.``amazon``.``com` `NOT FOUND`"" for every audio file that it tried to get. Since the sounds aren't crucial for the game to run, it just wouldn't have any audio. 

If you're trying to run an older Minecraft version and it has no audio, check the console for these errors. If they are present, that's the issue. 

As for solutions, I think some 3rd party launchers (like MultiMC) have workarounds for this issue (you want to use 3rd party launchers for older versions regardless of this issue though).",linux_gaming

If you are seeing the monitor running at its max refresh rate instead of reducing the Hz while the game is running at low fps, then this means VRR is not working for you. How to get this working on KDE Wayland would then be what to research next.

jeq9mwr,"Ubisoft games can be launched separately without Steam. You have one of two choices:

* Install Lutris and install Ubisoft Connect
   * [https://lutris.net/games/ubisoft-connect/](https://lutris.net/games/ubisoft-connect/)

The upside here is that you can keep all of your Ubisoft games in a single WINEPREFIX. The way steam works is for every game you install it creates a separate prefix. So every Ubisoft game will have their own prefix with different launchers. Using Lutris to install Ubisoft Connect will give you one prefix which will allow you to install every game into the same prefix. The downside  is that its possible each game needs something special or some kind of workaround. That will be up to you to figure out.

The alternative is to use separate prefix and still use Lutris. So lets say you want to install Assassin's Creed Odyssey and whatever other Ubisoft games. You can install each separately:

* [https://lutris.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey/](https://lutris.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey/)
* [https://lutris.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/](https://lutris.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/)

This uses a separate WINEPREFIX for each game. The benefit here is that any tweaks you make to one WINEPREFIX for a game don't affect any other game. But this will launch Ubisoft Connect and you'll install whatever game.

So I would give both a try and see how it works. I tend to just launch Ubisoft Connect and then install whatever game I want to play and use one WINEPREFIX. Now a days most games work reasonably well without a large number of tweaks. But if it doesn't work for some reason you can always try the game specific installer or look at what the installer does and just do that manually in the WINEPREFIX where you have Ubisoft Connect installed.",linux_gaming
jes1dx1,"You can just install ubisoft through lutris and play its games through it.

Or if you want to play through proton install it through lutris (like above) then find the ubisoft exe file and add it to steam through non-steam option. Then launch the launcher with proton compatibility, the games launched through the ubi-launcher will run on proton then.

You can also try to install ubisoft through wine tho I'm not sure it will work.",linux_gaming

If you didn't know, the latency OP is referring to is intended behavior for Wayland right now, but it's slowly being changed. Wayland just has more latency then x11 without compositing.

I have 75hz monitor and I can very easily feel it.

jf0oste,"Hey there. 

The distro I use is Arch Linux for refrence.

The desktop with ARC has been great. I would say it mirrors that of running a desktop off an Intel CPU (integrated GPU)  since it uses the same mesa drivers. They are open-source drivers so perhaps on par with those of AMD. I cant exactly confirm that since I haven't used an AMD GPU on Linux for any extended period of time. I am not too familiar with running a server but I'll give you the layout of my system if this helps you.

I use the intel ARC a770 16gb as my primary GPU (1st slot) and that's what the monitors are hooked up to. This runs my desktop and all applications. 

As far as ARC goes, all my electron apps (discord, ytmdesktop, etc.) on Wayland, that are normally really wonky on NVIDIA, runs perfectly. With a kernel patch (due to a current bug with intel drivers), I was able to get VRR working in Wayland which is not possible on Nvidia. 

In order to use my nvidia card for gaming I utilize PRIME render offloading with a command that I enter into steam. Essentially the nvidia GPU will render all the frames and pass them along to the intel card to present to the system and display them on the monitors.

PRIME render offloading is primarily used in laptops that have an intel iGPU on the CPU and a discrete Nvidia GPU.

With this set up I have been able to have all the open-source driver goodness on Linux and have the render power of Nvidia and all its features (ray tracing, DLSS, etc.). Basically, I get to have my cake and eat it too. 

The problem I was having was a terrible screen tearing happening when playing a game that went under 130FPS. This was just some weirdness happening from having resizable bar enabled in the BIOS. Once I disabled it, everything was running great.

Basically, if you are looking at an ARC GPU just for the desktop experiance, it most certainly is comparable to AMD. If you want it for gaming as well... Its just not there yet from my testing on gaming strictly with the ARC GPU.",linux_gaming

- it lacks some vulkan extensions that are critical for vkd3d-proton, and thus all d3d12 games, to perform well, which causes it to run sub 30 fps in most d3d12 games regardless of how powerful the system is. In particular, VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type and VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer are missing.
- in general it also suffer from much more bugs with DXVK and vkd3d-proton than radv does, and they often take forever to get addressed.

jekylpk,"(On my personal experience)

I had a great time when I used Pop_OS! on my laptop, I didn't dual boot but I kept the Windows ssd apart if something went wrong, everything was fine until I had a trouble with the OS completely freezing (it seems like it's an Ubuntu thing that doesn't work very well with my hardware). Really a shame because I loved the user experience, and it has a cool recovery protocol that helped me with that issue so I could migrate to something else.

I went to Nobara Project that is Fedora based and has pretty much everything already configured to have a good experience with games, programming and day to day use and has been my daily driver for months now (it did had kind of a little issue with an NVIDIA update but it got solved pretty quickly and the project developer was really helpful :D).

Aside from that, I tried stock Fedora and Linux Mint on other machines and they're also some pretty strong recommendations (although you'll have to do some tweaking on Fedora)

The thing with rolling releases (and my primary concern) is stability, so I would recommend going with something less ""bleeding edge"".",linux_gaming
jel0vr6,I started dual booting manjaro about 6 years ago and updates crashed it only 3 times during that time. Still on manjaro forums I was able to find fix in less than 30 minutes each time. Also those experiences forced me to learn how Linux OS works.,linux_gaming
jel7hjq,"I would like to save you a whole heck of a lot of trouble and just suggest you install Linux on a separate drive if at all possible. Grab a cheap sata SSD from your retailer of choice (250GB ones are like, under $30 USD frequently), and just install your distro on that. Of course if you're on a laptop or something this might not be possible, but if it's an option for you it'll save you a lot of headache. Dualbooting Windows/Linux from a single drive is not something I'd recommend to really anybody these days, it's just not worth it. If you can't afford to grab a new cheap SSD right now I would honestly just suggest waiting until you can get one, the amount of trouble and complications you'll be leading yourself into by trying a dual-boot is not worth the time or the 30 bucks an SSD costs.

As for the distro, honestly any of them work fine but I do have a preference for arch-based distros like endeavourOS. Distros like Fedora and Nobura are also great, with a preference for Nobura to make your gaming hassle-free. You won't have to worry about knowing what little utilities and fixes to install, it'll all just be there.

Stability really isn't going to be an issue for you on rolling release, stability issues really get overblown as a lot of folks on here will tell you. Especially in recent years, things like arch have been perfectly stable as long as you're not downloading from like, pre-release or beta channels.

I dual boot openSUSE and Windows on a single drive. Same setup on my laptop and desktop. Opensuse has two variants, Leap and Tumbleweed. Tumbleweed is the rolling release, which is what I use.

You'll need to change things up and learn some new stuff.

As for bloat on Windows, what exactly do you mean? I have a Windows install with hardly anything on it and it runs great, I don't need to reinstall anything and things don't break. As long as you're not installing a bunch of shit and forgetting about it, and as long as you go into your startup apps and disable things you don't use frequently from starting on boot, then bloat won't be much of an issue. Doubly so if you just uninstall things you don't use.

Luckily Rust can just handle undefined behavior the same way C does, so I think the verdict was ultimately ""well it catches errors that C currently cannot while in debug builds (integer overflow, etc), and it doesn't affect prod performance, ship it"".

iirc a lot of why C++ failed to make it into the kernel was because of all of the edge behavior around constructors, exceptions, etc which by the time you whittle down to a usable subset of the language, there's just no benefit. A subset of Rust by contrast is still beneficial.",linux_gaming

jeg0amu,"I mean, I don't think Valve's releasing Steam on ARM tomorrow or anything, but they definitely have their eye on the ecosystem. With Proton they've proven that they're willing to make gaming possible on multiple platforms, because they didn't want to be dependent on Windows, but if for instance Intel went the way of IBM, I don't think Valve would want to be any more reliant on just AMD for hardware.

So with that in mind, I think Valve's watching for probably the next year and a half to see what ARM and RiskV platforms come out, and they're probably going to make decisions about compatibility once they have an idea of what's out there.   


If there's no affordable, high performance, and open ARM solution that's capable of playing games? I don't think that Valve will have much interest, for instance (though we already have the RK3588S which is hardware-capable of playing a decent number of games on the Steam Library in a PC under $100), but with ARM's change in licensing (from a % of the value of the SoC to a % of the value of the end product), we may see a slowdown on vendors in the space.  


On the other hand, while RiskV is quite new, and doesn't have performant processors on the market yet, the type of software initiative to run x86 games on another platform would be big enough that if they saw the potential, Valve would have to get started before those platforms were available.

I think the major issue with RiskV would be the GPU side of things, actually; The only people you could license Vulkan drivers from would be AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Imagination, and ARM (or any of the companies using Mali GPUs...Which puts you in with ARM anyway), IIRC. In a situation where Valve didn't want to be dependent on a single company, AMD and Intel are out, Nvidia is difficult to work with, Qualcomm may not have the RnD to maintain GPU drivers depending on how the new ARM licensing works out, and Imagination is kind of a small player with mostly low end offerings, IIRC.

So it's tough to say.",linux_gaming

AMD is the one that's pointlessly replicating everything with AMDVLK, AMD GPU Pro and RADV. The first 2 share code with Windows. AMDVLK has a different shader compiler that's pretty bad and RADV is pretty much entirely developed by Valve contractors and hobbyists.",linux_gaming
jeu7byg,"I didn't say that Vulkan is implemented on top of Gallium. What I'm saying is that if you implement some feature in your driver for Vulkan, you can implement it for Gallium and get OpenGL ""for free"".

Both Gallium driver and Vulkan driver are using features provided by driver itself so if driver implement some feature, there is no reason why it should be limited to Vulkan if Gallium can use same feature for OpenGL.",linux_gaming
jeu6yej,"In some ways it is, in some isn't. Gallium is low level so it can be used by higher level APIs like Vulkan (in fact Vulkan is even lower level) but Gallium was never meant to be used directly by applications and it's designed to be layer between actual API and driver while Vulkan is API for applications and providing layer between higher level API and driver is just additional feature.",linux_gaming

jeu7v9k,There is no point of making ARM device if you only want to run x86 code on it. Why deal with compatibility layers overhead if you can just use SoC that gets this code natively?,linux_gaming
jeuz47l,"That's where it gets a bit weird. You probably don't want an ARM device that's ONLY for running x86 code, sure.

But what about a device that can get by on mostly ARM programs (for instance, an emulation focused handheld), which people may also want to run one or two x86 games? Keep an eye on RK3588 handhelds, I think you'll see a lot of this, in particular.

But another point, which I think many people forget, is that while technically, x86 processors to run the entire spectrum from intel celerons to mendocino APUs to the upcoming 7x40H Phoenix series APU line...x86 Processors tend to be designed for high power applications, and can have difficulties scaling down to a wattage comfortable for a small handheld. Often if you take an x86 APU and take it down to a handheld wattage (3-5 watts), you'll get worse performance than a comparable ARM SoC, not because ARM is better or x86 is dead, or anything, but ARM IP tends to operate really well in that range. And sometimes, you'll see a situation where an ARM SoC can outperform an x86 based one, even through an emulation layer in the right situation (being GPU bottlenecked comes to mind, where as long as you're wrapping the GPU libraries, the CPU should be able to keep up, even through an emulation layer).

And there's yet another point: Many of the software solutions that allow you to use x86 code on ARM...Could be extended to work on other ISAs, such as RISC V. While it's not a real contender yet, that's not guaranteed in perpetuity. We could see in ten years for instance, that something unforeseen comes about, and x86 processors stop being made for consumers, in the same way that IBM doesn't really make processors for consumers, either. I don't know about you, but I'd like to be able to carry my software library forward with me for as long as I live, and possibly be able to show off some of my formative experiences to people from the next generation, even if they roll their eyes at me and call me old.

A major part of preserving these experiences is preserving the ability to run them, and if you really want to be sure about that, that starts today, with project like fexemu, box86, and box64 and so on.",linux_gaming

It is device for running PC games. And PC games are basically x86 exclusive. So there is not much sense of making ARM device in the purpose of running x86 software most time.  


Sure ARM would be beneficial for Steam Deck due to much better power efficiency but these advantages are not that significant if you run x86 soft with emulation. Of course that doesn't mean software like Box86, Box64 or FEX-Emu are useless. You mentioned preservation and that's a good point.

The RX570 or RX580 would be the obvious choices but they can pull 200W or more and I'd be very scared of that PSU. I have no idea if the 5500XT or 5600XT or even later AMD cards were better in that regard to power draw but then you have resizable BAR coming into the conversation and PSU connection to consider.

The machine appears to be one of these 

https://youtu.be/wdnmFItWXKs

The PSU is clearly proprietary, I assume it's not the one in the video or you are screwed. A Gigabyte 1650  OC is probably the fastest thing you can get in that case https://www.techspot.com/review/1837-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-75w/

That gets you sort of in and around a RX570 without the power draw issue.

I think you need to post a picture of the machines internals particularly the PSU, it's spec label/part number and the connectors it has available. People will be able to help properly then.

The alternative is to locate and purchase the highest power PSU that HP fitted into that Chassis make sure it has 6+2 GPU connections, fit it then fit a much newer higher end GPU in there or second hand higher end card.",linux_gaming

A very thin and bendy, USB 2.0 USB-C cable that's mostly used for charging, can physically substitute for a full-featured cable, but it can't always do what's asked. It can't transmit alt-mode video or USB data rates over 480 Mbit/s or power over 3 Amps.

ostree easily allows you to rollback your image/deployments if anything ever gets borked, without having to setup timeshift or snapper for snapshots on the default BTRFS setup on a normal Fedora install.

Fedora also tends to have a more up to date kernel+mesa without having to add a PPA.

Universal Blue is pretty amazing, takes Silverblue or Kinoite and adds fancy udev rules for things like controllers outside of Steam, Openrgb rules etc and embracing OCI cloud based container images on ostree. 🤯

Were being major pain points stopping the system from being able to run updates at the time.

Fedora needs codecs from rpmfusion for hardware acceleration mostly as well, universal blue enables that out of box without extra steps.

another reason is because inefficiencies of ""windows"" drivers. for a long time on windows amds dx11 libraries were not that great. resulting in that amd on linux with dxvk ran better because it was being ran through radv. even running dxvk on windows with amd resulted in better performance because amds windows vulkan libraries were much better than their dx11. fallout 4 was a fine example of this that even on windows using dxvk resulted in better performance because amds native dx11 libraries were not as performative as they are now since their major dx11 update a few drivers back. then you run into other games that are dx11 or dx9 that really push their engines to their limit with what those directx versions can do, and running them through vulkan helps alleviate those games. fallout new vegas comes to mine in this regard since its dx9 engine is pushed to its limit. especially when modding.

then somethings vulkan does much better. directx might support the same thing, but vulkan does it far more efficiently that even with the overhead, it comes out faster.

and finally you have lower end systems where dxvk can help because of vulkans multithreaded nature can help, even with its overhead (i remember awhile ago a dxvk developer said at best they can get the overhead down to maybe 5% performance impact), because you are able to spread more things out to other cores when you are dealing with a super single threaded bound game on a poor performing system.",linux_gaming

Issues arise when trying to emulate directdraw (or anything DIB-related), *especially* indexed (8 bit) graphics via OpenGL, Wine developers struggled with that, but IIRC they finally implemented a proper DIB engine.

jejxwuo,"It's all about bulletproofing your OS to have the maximum security and reliability possible while also having resillience in case something actually breaks (because why not?) and last but not least the ability to run any cutting edge program/app that you need. In other words a distro that doesn't need to be stable to be rock-solid.

So let's see the different concepts that make this possible:

Immutability:
- Comes from a read-only ready-made *system image* where your root and core utilities reside and is common to everyone that is using the same distro and same version of that image. In theory this translates to a system that has been thoroughly tested because it's the exact same for a large number of people. Mind that the system image is read-only only for other users and programs, it is not read-only for your root user ;)
- Still to be proven but in theory immutability will offer developers a more stable platform to target their development which in turn might lead to easier faster applications and updates florishing in our GNU/Linux garden.

Transactional Updates
- Your system is updated in a single transaction (imagine 1 single large package instead of hundreads of small ones) and it is checked at the end if the installation was successfull, if it wasn't it is not applied/taken into effect.
- Normally also Atomic, you can upgrade your system while continuing to run it, there is absolutely no issues to keep on working/gaming while doing a distro upgrade. It only upgrades on restart.
- Also means that an update can be rolled back with no consequences.

Containerization of Userland
- Apps, programs, extra CLI utilities all run inside containers outside of the system image so not only they can't interfere with your system they are secured via the options the container tech being used has. Most used container tech now is Flatpak for GUI apps, distrobox/toolbox/apx for CLI apps, but you can also run any GUI app from distrobox in fact distrobox makes it possible for you to have access to any distro repository really easy including the AUR ;)
- This also means that updating applications is 100% independant of your system, so you can for example be running Fedora 37 as your base system but have in distrobox OpenSuse Tumbleweed for all the latest apps you need.

Are you feeling the power now? It gets better:

The huge myth around immutable distros is that you can't customize or tinker with your system internals. This is a lie at least for the 3 big Desktop oriented ones we have today: Silverblue, MicroOS and VanillaOS

The thing here is you don't custominize litle by litle, you do a ""rulebook"" like a script and you change everything you need in 1 go after the next restart ;)

This opens the possibility (still in development) for people to create their own core system images and to be able to reproduce themselves their perfect custom system accross different machines very easily.

The idea I'm talking about is to have a core system that is rock solid, stable, and built for gaming, but everything else is in a mutable container pre-set up so I don't have to mess with distrobox every time I get a new drive I want to put the distro on. There's also the AUR to consider, I actually use that quite a bit. Not for many things, but for the things I do use it for I consider them essential. gnome-pie being one of those things.

Alright so basically, I'm the kind of person who uses EndeavourOS instead of regular arch more often than not because I don't like to constantly have to go get my copy and paste of ""sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel && git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git && cd yay-bin && makepkg -si && cd ~"" every time I reinstall yay, I'd rather just have it pre-set up. The other problem is that Arch and even EndeavourOS (extremely similar distros) are a rolling release bleeding edge distro thus not as stable and subject to breakage, like how Glibc broke easy anticheat that one time, or how arch broke GRUB that one time.


What I'm saying is I want all of the backend tweaks and fixes in Nobara Project for gaming that make it more efficient than most distros for gaming, in the format of BlendOS as an immutable distro that has distrobox pre-set up for Arch, Fedora, and Ubuntu so I don't personally have to fuck around with it every time I reinstall the distro.

Yeah thats what we call ""Vitamin-B"", which is very looked down upon. Which is why at times its not a good idea to work in the same place where your family works (depending on the size of said company). Ofcourse a certain level of connection (like link in and so on), is always good, but if a person is known to be antiquated with a possible employee, they most of the time dont involve themselves in the hiring process for said person.",linux_gaming
jegvvbc,"> even get *paid* a bit

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

I remember ARK with lot of problems dealing with their Linux build... but their major issue was lack of maintenance of the build. They never updated the Unreal Engine version (bugs on reflections) and constantly delayed releases.

While the Linux version was overall awful visually, it still provided better performance and +60% reduced game size.

The porter is entirely dependent on cooperation from the original developer and/or publisher.

Secondly, as a developer of non-game software, the ""resources"" thing is not as simple as gamers want it to be. Games that are developed from the start to be portable, port easily. Games that use proprietary APIs like Metal or [WCA](http://shanekirk.com/2015/10/a-brief-history-of-windows-audio-apis/), don't look any different or sound any different, they just don't port well. D3D12 is currently taking a pounding from gamers because of the perception that it performs poorly, and doesn't add anything.

Is it extra effort to be portable? Sometimes no, sometimes yes, often ""it depends"". It doesn't take a hundred dev-hours to decide to use Vulkan, OpenAL, or SDL2.

Are you going to be portable to any GPU, or just some of them? Is it going to save you time to only support Vulkan 1.2 GPUs and later? Are you going to use proprietary extensions, and if so, why?

You should port it to Android! ... But nope, nah, you should not port it to desktop linux, just check if the Windows build works, maybe if you have the time. We should not allocate resources to that platform. 

Imagine if someone said: Hey MS, you can have our fancy game on Xbox, here's our build, it worked on a PS3 emulator, you could make it work, right? Its not like you could not just load this emulator, right?

It is portable between operating systems as long as the GPU targets are the same.

Typically PC games for example are optimised for AMD, Nvidia (and to a lesser degree intel) gpus and the VK features and apis they expose.   VK engines for these games will not run without large changes on other VK GPUs as the set of features those gpus expose is different.   Even if you do not use any proprietary extensions just using standard vk 1.2 apis will still lead you into a situations were you might not run or you will run with very poor occupancy on other hardware.
