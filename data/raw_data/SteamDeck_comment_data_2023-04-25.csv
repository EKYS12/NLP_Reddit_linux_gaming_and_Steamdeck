jhoxa9q,Some games aren't even purchasable anymore so piracy is the only way,SteamDeck
jhox0et,"So true. Wish EA and Ubi would understand that adding more barriers to playing your game on Steam will backfire in the end. I bet they'd see game sales skyrocket on Steam if they just released stuff normally. Valve should have a policy in place that if your game exists on another PC storefront without a secondary login requirement (meaning, only ONE account required), then it must be that way on Steam too.

If Epic can get away with doing this with achievements (they require all games on EGS to have achievements now if those games have achievements on other platforms) then Valve could surely do something like this.

If publishers want to scoop up the data, they can allow you to link to Steam one time. No need for a launcher that never remembers to stay logged in and causes all sorts of problems.",SteamDeck
jhos2ul,Admittedly 12 year old me would disagree as I had no money (like every 12 year old) so then I would go to the scary parts of the internet for games but now I have a little disposable income I'd pay slightly more to have it on steam than have to fuck about resetting my epic/ea/gog password never mind pirating it!,SteamDeck
jhp1589,"The music industry already proved this. You want combat piracy, make the official routes more convenient than piracy. People will pay for convenience.",SteamDeck
jhp32cj,"Remember the time when Ubisoft had to resort to pirating their own game. Because Ubisoft put some shitty DRM in their game and couldn't remove it. So they just officially replaced their exe with a cracked one.

jhp13j3,"Currently in Brazil, is a problem with prices too, the prices are so high here in Brazil that a normal person can buy a game once every 6 months or so.

There are games costing half of a salary right now here. Piracy had reduced by a lot in Brazil over the years, but recently it is back to growing, and very fast.",SteamDeck

jhoyu0a,"Piracy was such a blessing and a curse for me. I had console copiers  as a kid, so I had every SNES & N64 game in an era where most people didn't even know what a ROM was. I basically had any PSX era game as long as I had the kid birthday money around for blank CDs. But...fuck...

I have been conditioned to buy any game that I even MIGHT want, and my fucking steam library is ridiculous. Just... insane. I'm over 1000 titles now and haven't played 90 % of them. I know there's studies which show people who pirate things also spend the most money on games, too. This is me. I pirated everything as a kid, and now I just spend way too much money on videogames and computer parts and new techy things. It has conditioned me to have very little self control.

If it wasn't for /gamedeals and [isthereanydeal.com](https://isthereanydeal.com) I'd be super bankrupt.",SteamDeck
jhp78g1,"You know what? I hate hearing about people getting screwed over by DRM, but I'm also extremely happy that more people are talking about it because of the Deck.",SteamDeck
jhosyiq,"I feel that he is half right, on 1st world countries maybe price is not the main issue but is the one that weights more, after all disscounts are a Godsend in most games, on development countries everything is around the price and even with disscount some cost a lot in comparison with the salary",SteamDeck
jhoxvl7,"Well he's correct. I used to download games all of the time just to have them. That was a decade and a half ago. Now, I'll just wait until they are on sale for a few bucks because it's so much easier.

The size of my steam library compared to the games I've downloaded illegally since steam really started picking up steam (yes pun) is the proof in the pudding.",SteamDeck

jhpgpo8,"This is just the whole streaming argument redone for games. We all pirated movies until Netflix came along then everyone signed up for Netflix 'cause it had all the movies for one cheap subscription. 10 years later, all the stuff you want to see is split between Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, etc. etc. so back to pirating stuff. 

There's just an obvious crossover point on the graph of ""how difficult is it to pirate"" vs ""what does it cost to subscribe to all the services you'd need""",SteamDeck

jhp9wps,"He is completely correct. I used to pirate games regularly up until steam came out. Then, I was basically happy to shell out full price for games because I knew I didn't have to deal with drm (for the most part), could redownload my games as many times as I want, and didn't have to fiddle to get the game to work or worry about inadvertently installing a virus along with my game. Then they rolled out feature after feature like cloud saves and now I can't imagine pirating anymore because I'd lose all the convenience of steam.

jhoy0zy,Fuck Rockstar too. Can‚Äôt even play my games unless I connect though their shitty app which needs me to be online for.,SteamDeck
jhp458n,"Yep. You learn that piracy is mostly done because of restricted access, not the cost of the game. You restrict it on one platform? Pirated. You put Denuvo on a single player game, running its performance? Pirated. 

I would imagine the only time cost is a factor is Nintendo games. Since they have boxed themselves into their own ecosystem they control the sales, or lack there of. Many people don‚Äôt like to buy an old game at $60. Especially when it could be found in the $15- $20 bin at Walmart.",SteamDeck

You can find some help with doing that here: https://www.protondb.com/app/243470

Meanwhile I‚Äôve had no problem playing it on Steam with other Steam friends at all.  Companies need to get their shit together, because it‚Äôs absolutely a mess of an ecosystem out there right now.

You were probably many things, but stealing isn't one of them. I don't think we ever truly came up with a good term for what was happening.

Copyright infringement just doesn't have the same ring to it, but stealing causes damage because you took something of value another person now no longer has to use or sell.

jhp3f1g,"Same, I spent years wanting to play the Xbox port of the first Onimusha, but when Capcom finally gave the series any kind of modern release, it was just the Ps2 version of the first game with some slight enhancements. I bought it to support the idea of the series coming back or just getting the rest of it ported to modern systems, but I still see it as a huge misstep on their part that they didn't bring over any of the myriad changes made to that game for its Xbox release as Genma Onimusha. Combining Warlords and Genma would've justified the standalone release in the eyes of a lot of fans who were annoyed by it only being the first game getting a port, as a lot of us never got to try the heavily altered Genma version of the game and Warlords is an extremely short game. 

So with no other options to play Genma, emulation it is. If Capcom would give me the option, I'd buy it in a second and I already bought the Ps2 version Warlords on three platforms, two of them being the HD port.

The joycon initial pairing seems good at first but always have trouble pairing after SD go to sleep and wake up. I don't have this issue with my DS4 controller at all and it will reconnect 100% of the time. In split mode, it's a 50/50 chance to get the joycon to reconnect on wakeup and I have to fiddle with the sync button for a minute or two. It's random and unreliable.

During gameplay you MUST turn off all rumble feature. This can be a hassle since you might have to look into disabling it in both the SD menu and in the game menu to be sure. For some reason, the rumble data can oversaturate the Bluetooth bandwidth and cause signal to drop. Others have experience weak BT range but I haven't experience this issue so YMMV. Also, even with rumble off, the joycon battery still don't last more than 45m~1hr on a full charge and will cut short any long party/co-op game session.

The joycon driver on SD and Linux is useable but imperfect and is more or less an imitation of mapped inputs on the Switch ported over. Without an official driver from Nintendo or until someone comes out with a better driver, there will always be BT connection and signal issues so it's hard to recommend using joycon with SD unless you're an enthusiast.",SteamDeck

Without an official driver from Nintendo or until someone comes out with a better driver, there will always be BT connection and signal issues so it's hard to recommend using joycon with SD unless you're an enthusiast.

I've looked at the driver that's in the linux kernel, valve is using their own userspace implementation.  
The issue is, joycons expect perfectly timed bluetooth packets that tell them the 3d rumble pattern, which is in term used as a keepalive pattern, basically telling them to stay on and keep sending inputs.  
On the switch this driver (I'm guessing here) is running in a way that ensures that timing and prioritizes this. On linux this is way harder, since the bluetooth stack doesn't enforce this timing well enough, also the timeout when the kernel decides a controller has disconnected is far to long, so the controller and kernel sometimes have different opinions on the paring status, which will cause a re-pair (which would happen on the next button press on the controller) to just fall on it's face.  
Also the implementation of the controller numbering is fairly broken, so sometimes controllers can loose it's number when re-paring.  
  
I've thought about trying to rewrite the driver with the community knowledge on github, but I didn't quite get around to doing it (and don't have any linux driver dev knowledge lol).",SteamDeck

jhpmhep,">dock, skins, SD cards, carrying case, new controller, headsets all right out of the gates

Wtf are you on about?

* dock - don't need if you just play in handheld mode
* skins - objectively don't need, and in my opinion look worse than a clean steam deck
* SD  cards - while nice, you don't NEED. There is storage on the deck
* Carrying case - it literally comes with a fucking case
* new controller - What???? Why would you need a new controller?
* Headsets - Most people already have headsets or earbuds, and regardless there are speakers
* Steam games - A big appeal to the steam deck is most people already have steam games. So no, he does not need to buy more

Only thing I kept was a PSP go cause I needed to have at very minimum AT LEAST one way to play PSP natively.

jhoggrh,"Right but pixel density matters in perceived resolution, particularly when you‚Äôre talking about resolution relative to screen size. At the SD‚Äôs size (is it 7 inches?) 800p looks great because the pixel density is high.

jhoihpq,"I feel like we're ignoring distance in this equation. A screen's PPI is only important when you're comparing screens of the same distance from your eyes. If you hold your Steam Deck at a distance from your face such that it takes up a comparable percentage of your total field of vision as, say, a large 1080p TV, PPI no longer matters. What matter is the ""pixels per percentage of your total field of vision"". Which would effectively map directly to resolution. Higher resolution, better image quality, and that's regardless of screen size, so long as the screens are taking up the same amount of your total field of vision.",SteamDeck
jho7oc3,"Yep. Which is why I'm surprised there wasn't a 1080p option. Certainly most people would prefer the 720p model - it'd be cheaper, for one, and of course, if you want to run a more demanding game, you'll need to either run at a lower, non-native res, or an ugly lower-than-30 frame rate. But for older games and indie games - where the Steam Deck really shines, at least for me - the Steam Deck can handle those easily at 1080p60. But we're stuck at 720, and I'm stuck dealing with the screen door effect that a lower resolution screen causes, just like on Switch.",SteamDeck
jhpmib8,"Is the replacement worth it compared to just a foil? Much cheaper, much safer to install and if you get scratches just get a new foil.",SteamDeck
jhoquz8,"I'm not sure that's true. 

Usually if your handheld device is the same size in your vision as your TV, you're either too far from your TV or too close to your handheld. I just made my phone the ""same size"" as my laptop screen (roughly 12-14 inches from my face)  in my field of view, and I had to hold my phone basically at the end of my nose, which is way too close. 

I would be curious to know if your TV and SD took up the same amount of space which would appear sharper. I'd imagine it's the Deck because of the higher PPI, but it's also highly impractical.",SteamDeck
jhpnafr,Well more options = more cost of logistics n shit,SteamDeck
jhotxob,"If the two objects are the same distance away, the device with the higher PPI would appear sharper. If the two objects take up the same amount of your field of vision, the device with the higher resolution would appear sharper, regardless of distance (assuming you can properly focus on both screens, so we're ignoring eyesight issues). This would be because, adjusted for difference in distance, if each screen is the same relative size and same resolution, the perceived PPI would be the same. Lower the resolution, and perceived PPI also lowers.",SteamDeck

Its simply too high res, and will only eat battery life for nothing. 120Hz screen is even more stupid, again eats battery and barely any game will run at consistent 120fps. Then it also uses Windows, which has shit ton of battery hogging background apps too.

Asus is not making much money of it if they compete with SD on the price, and if they charge same as other handheld makers there won't be much sales.

By the way, those 'double performance' claims, that appears to be CPU scores at 35 W TDP. So you wouldn't see it in a real game, because those are mostly GPU bound. And if you actually ran at 35 W, even if you could cool it down fast enough with their double fans, your battery would die in about 20 minutes. Every tech expert is saying the 'double performance' is wildly misleading at best. The 50 % at 15 W is more realistic, but it's still just theoretical math, no one has properly benchmarked this with real games.

Not necessarily a performance upgrade, but the base Z1 should match the Van Gogh APU in the steam deck from a gratis perspective. On the CPU side Z1 will utterly smash the deck (2-2.5x uplift).

2.8 TFLOPS from 4 RDNA3 CUs would indicate a clockspeed of roughly 2.8 GHz, a full 75% higher than the deck's 1.6 GHz limit. It's also RDNA3 which has been providing a roughly 15-20% uplift based solely on uArch improvements. Basically you're looking at twice the performance per CU which puts the base Z1 right in line with the Deck.

Whether you consider the hardware side of things an upgrade is up to you. Personally the loss of the trackpads, steam OS, and the ergonomic changes place it at more of a side-grade in my mind. With that said, 120hz with VRR would be extremely nice to have and the vastly improved performance for high end emulation would be sweet.

And if something did, why would you sacrifice so much extra battery life to run at that? You know, the Deck's second big achilles heel: battery life.

Ultimately, on a handheld you need to strike a good balance between cost, performance, weight, ergonomics, size, heat, battery life,... And I don't feel like Asus is doing that. Everyone is dialing games down to 40 hz to get better graphics and battery life, and they come out with 120 hz. That's not how handhelds works. Just now they said they wanted to do VRR.

If they were a cheap chromebook, they'd be marked down in a review for the quality of the screen...and they're a handheld gaming device.

Battery is often trumpeted as vitally important for handhelds. I don't know about your usage, but my deck rarely went below 70%. Handheld is just not a form factor I'm going to play for multiple hours. The benefit of handheld is quick pop in and out. I would happily exchange a better product for a shorter battery life. When I'm traveling with my handhelds there's power everywhere and I already have a host of battery banks with me to keep the many, many other devices we all have charged.

I may be unique. Perhaps the average handheld user DOES use their device for hours at a time. I don't know. I bet ASUS knows though.

VRR is especially useful on devices that can't hold a specific framerate. It's common on the deck to lower refresh rate not because the deck can't hit higher FPS, but because it can't HOLD it. VRR solves for that by adjusting the refresh rate to match the FPS.",SteamDeck

So you can do all that....or on Windows you can just run the setup wizard. These were literally the first 5 games I tried and every one had an issue with the OS.

SteamOS is an adventure in checking ProtonDB for compatibility before you even buy the game, then searching that database for workarounds to the problem if one exists.

* utilizing Lossless Scaling for FSR

* Adjusting GPU and CPU Clocks
* Xbox and DS4 controller emulation support
* EqualizerAPO for better sound from the speakers

You cannot have a flawless experience whether it's SteamOS or Windows. There is always bugs. There are reasons to use either OS, there isn't a ""better"" or ""best"" there is a ""best for you"".

Valve's lack of Windows support forces the community to find tweaks and create apps to streamline the experience as best as possible, but it's still janky from a UI standpoint.

As far as ProtonDB ratings, once you account for native titles around 45 of the top 100 games should in theory work perfectly, but gold titles in my experience also usually work perfectly or, in the worst case, with very minor problems. This is especially the case for Steam Deck given that many titles are rated gold due to issues specific to certain hardware or OS installations, and the Steam Deck is a fixed configuration with Valve prioritizing fixes that affect it in particular.

It will run natively on the Steam Deck without Proton and the restrictions in the demo will not be there.

It's Arkane Studios' first game that they wanted to be Ultima Underworld III but got denied, which sadly wasn't much of a financial success, I believe. Great game from 2002 with a great atmosphere, and an interesting magic casting system.

Contrast is... mediocre. So are black levels.

At that point if you display an image that has a gradual change from a yellow with a vibrancy of 8 to a 9 and finally to 10, now it will all look like 10. It's basically crushing detail.

Actually you don't need to imagine anything. Look at, say, [this picture](https://images6.alphacoders.com/130/1302421.jpg) while playing around with the vibrancy. You will see finer details like the pendant on Dracula's chest in the background quickly disappear.",SteamDeck

The second problem I have, is it's pretty hard to see the corners of the screen. This isn't always a problem, but it can be an issue if you end up playing something that throws tiny text in a corner.

Second, your design seems to just have one straight arm with articulation at the base and mounting points. I've seen several gopro style arm mounts on this reddit and 3d print sites that have extra articulation elbows to accomodate different angles. I don't think I would buy a mount if there isn't at least 1 articulation elbow in the mid section.

Third, have you test if the design is able to reverse mount a phone below the SD? I think that's a use case many have not experiment with and can be a viable experience.

1. Yeah I do understand wanting a mechanical grip, but making an arm like that adds a ton of weight to the design, which actually makes it feel to me like it tips it into unusable territory. I also experience your frustrations with magnets and magsafe adapters, and I've done a lot of research on them actually. I found there is one specific kind of adapter that works heads and shoulders better than the rest, and that's the one I'm going to include in the kit.
2. Pretty similar comment for the extra articulation point. It adds some weight, and my research shows that 90-95% of customers only need the one degree of freedom. This is what's so cool about using the gopro standard, since if you find yourself in the 5-10% of customers that need more articulation, it's really easy to expand the system to fit your needs exactly.
3. The current design can mount below the Deck! (it's a bullet point in the image shown in the original post) All you have to do is unclip it from your deckmate and reclip it in the other orientation. (this is actually the way I use it most comfortably)

In the end there's not going to be a perfect mount for every single person, so I'm trying to design the most versatile version so people can customize it to their own desires!

* Go to desktop mode
* Download the game's iso (I got this from myabandonware)
* Download the 1.1 patch, there's a US and EU version depending on the iso you have, for me this was the EU one that is available on pcgamingwiki
* Open the iso from within the Dolphin file explorer and extract it's contents to a folder
* Install Lutris (you can get this from discover)
* Within Lutris:
   * Click the + button on the top left for ""add game""
   * Select ""install a windows game from media""
   * Give it a name (I just did Riddick)
   * Install
   * Change installation location if needed
   * When prompted for the setup file, browse to the folder you extracted the iso into and select ""setup.exe""
   * Let it run, which will start the games installer
   * Perform the install
   * When it is finished, close the installer and do not start the game yet
* In Dolphin
   * Move the exe for the patch into the same directory as Riddick.exe - you can find this path from Lutris if needed
* Back in Lutris
   * Highlight the game and go to the bottom bar where there is a wine menu you can expand
   * Click ""run EXE inside wine prefix""
   * Select the patch and let it run
      * If it fails, you may have a different region iso/patch or have cracks installed that prevent it applying properly
   * After the patch succeeds, right click the game and click ""configure""
   * Go to ""game options""
   * Change the executable from whatever/folders/Riddick.exe to whatever/folders/System/Win64_AMD64/SbzEngine.exe
   * Run the game
* In game
   * Go to settings and change the resolution to 1280 x 800
      * The default resolution is very weird and cuts off the sides of the screen
   * Enable gamepad
   * Re-configure the controls, the default gamepad has left and right sticks swapped from most games

One weird thing I have noticed, at least for me when I try to select a profile to continue a game I can't pick it with start/a, I had to set one of the keys to ""enter"". The gamepad works for all other menus.

jhmsxj9,"4 ran so damn well, even if it was a massive battery killer, and also you had to change down to 30FPS to beat the final QTE on the chopper. I suppose the only thing I felt that was missing in 4 was the different environments? I think at the time, the city itself was so stunning and the game physics were so fun to mess around with I didn't really think about it; but coming off of the back of San Andreas, and also having played GTA5, it was a shame to not have little bits of desert/mountains/lakes/forests etc.

I'm wondering actually how well GTA5 runs on the Deck now that there's been more time for folks to find the best settings etc...",SteamDeck
jhnczvf,One of the best Deck experiences so far. It's such an improvement over playing on the 360 when it came out years ago. It holds up surprisingly well in 2023.,SteamDeck

jhnsixr,"Honestly, dunno why you're capping your framerate at 45FPS (unless for battery), I managed to get a mostly smooth 60 with occasional dips to 40-45 but they were dips and gone back to 60 for the most part!  


Did my replay of GTA 4 on the Steam Deck for the first time since 2015(?) for the cheevos and all of it was perfectly playable on the Steam Deck, and the framerate cap shortcut being soooo much easier to fix the helicopter QTE at the end than having to change to a 30Hz resolution and turning on VSync to fix it.

All the while looking as gorgeous as I remember it, with a full 60FPS. Even modded the game for the old licensed tracks that were removed (it's a fucking joke they removed Gruppa Krovi from Vladivostok FM)",SteamDeck

jhnchkb,"Try upscaling and following a guide for best optimization on the Deck. I felt the same way, but doing a few minor tweaks made took the game look and feel sooo much better.

It may have been a bad PC port upon release, but playing it on modern hardware today, it is now a massive improvement in performance and visuals IMO. Really elevates the game.

Also, maybe it's just me but the expansions each make it look even better than the base game. Better effects, lighting, and even cerain models and animation to my eyes.",SteamDeck

Other than that 45 worked really well no issues at all and most of the graphic settings turned to high",SteamDeck

jhnlgp0,"Oh eww, I'm just wanting to play single player thankfully!",SteamDeck
jhncbi3,Man it's tempting....,SteamDeck
jhnxe0j,Yup. Dunno what the other guy is talking about. GTA:V will launch and play completely offline perfectly fine. The caveat is that you have to have launched it online first to activate it before you try and launch it offline.,SteamDeck
jhmv635,There‚Äôs easy mods to get around this,SteamDeck
jhno9c2,I'll try messing around with the scaling and see if anything helps. Thanks for the advice.,SteamDeck
jhno7cu,"Did you manage to ""fix"" it, or did your eyes eventually get accustomed to the strain?",SteamDeck
jhn9ed2,I have a 3060 it runs fine all you have to do is lock the frame rate and it gets a lot smoother.,SteamDeck
jhn57cj,Thanks I've been confused about this...,SteamDeck
jhn1i33,"You probably tried it on a 60 hz screen. The key point is that every frame should be displayed for an equal amount of time to achieve smooth motion. 60 fps runs perfectly on 60 hz because each game frame matches each refresh of the screen perfectly. 30 fps also works, with each frame being displayed twice. But 45 fps does not fit into 60 hz without displaying some frames longer than others.

On the Steam Deck, it is possible to run games smoothly at 45 fps, because you can just set the screen to refresh at 45 hz.",SteamDeck
jhms853,Comprehension fail on my behalf. Sorry.,SteamDeck
jhnkb5e,"so i should force a higher resolution in steam‚Äôs launch options? is that what you mean? what resolution would you reccomend, i‚Äôm guessing not too much higher than 800p..?

there‚Äôs been a few games (including gta IV) i‚Äôve been trying to find a way to get rid of the jagged edges",SteamDeck
jho1cso,Wouldnt that be downscaling then?,SteamDeck
jhnqo8d,"Oh nice, I might have to get it",SteamDeck
jhn23rm,Thanks! I Will try that!,SteamDeck
jhp64n6,On my xbox one playing gta San Andreas the radio would only play certain songs and then loop again,SteamDeck
jhnk6a3,You need to change your refresh rate to 40hz and then you get the option of 40fps.,SteamDeck
jho28mk,Not consistently when I played. There were common drops from 60 to 40fps,SteamDeck
jhoix64,It's awesome on the deck for sure.,SteamDeck
jhmzcjr,Such as?,SteamDeck
jho0dur,"I just stopped playing it honestly. I set the camera acceleration to 0 and sensitivity all the way up which helped a bit since it was mainly messing with me when moving the camera, but it was still strangely uncomfortable to play so I gave up for now. Too many other games in my backlog to be dealing with that lol",SteamDeck
jhnx2qr,The problem the previous guy references to is when you try to divide 45 frames over 60 refresh cycles. Dividing 45 frames over 45 screen refreshes gives you a steady frametime and therefor looks relatively smooth. As long as you can maintain the fps.,SteamDeck
jhn2sqv,It was on my Steam Deck! I maybe had the refresh still at 60 in that case,SteamDeck
jhn5dd3,So on Windows if I change the display to 45hz and set frames to 45 I can achieve the same effect?,SteamDeck
jhn0b80,"Lol we‚Äôve all done it no worries, GTAIV has an unlocked frame rate however so on Series X it hits the 60fps target nearly constantly‚Ä¶ which is actually game breaking but you know",SteamDeck
jhoinad,"Yep, I used 1600x1000 in launch options. It's not perfect, but helps a lot (to my eyes anyhow) and is worth the small performance hit.",SteamDeck
jhohx4u,"Whoops, yes, that's correct.",SteamDeck
jhns8v6,Thanks,SteamDeck
jhn3a8t,Google fu,SteamDeck
jhnxrdi,"On windows - if I change the refresh rate of the monitor to 45hz in Nvidia control panel and set the game fps to 45fps - can I achieve the same effect as the Deck? 

It's such a useful feature on Deck it's odd it's not so easy to achieve on Windows - you can create a custom resolution and refresh rate but it's not an intuitive process like on the SD.",SteamDeck
jhn3hzl,Likely! Although some stuff (like prerendered videos) might have a fixed framerate in some games and can only ever look smooth at that framerate or a multiple of it.,SteamDeck
jhnn9af,"If you can get the screen to actually refresh at 45 hz, the effect is the same, no matter the operating system.",SteamDeck
jhon12y,"I cant get it to work tho. I tried forcing it via steam (same menu as where you do proton etc). I also tried forcing it via ini config files. Does not seem to work for me, still jaggies.

Did you do anything special? Do you play it on tv or just the deck?",SteamDeck
jho2a28,"I dont think a piece of software (in this case Nvidia control panel) can force a display to display 45hz at a hardware level like the deck can.

I mean it might depend in the monitor and newer monitors can do more with variable refresh rates. But I dont think you can make a run of the mill monitor that natively does 60hz, run on 45 at a hardware level. I think in that case you would still have a situation when you softwarematicly force the display down to 45, but if its 60 native youll still be dividing 45 virtual hz over 60 actual hz before you even take fps into account

I can probably not explain it as technical as the eventual next guy who will probably correct me. But if this was a thing, it would probably be more popular. And this is why 30 fps is usually in the game options because its exactly double the frametime on a 60hz display and therefor will still look (relatively) smooth if that frametime remains steady.",SteamDeck
jhnqdlf,">If you can get the screen to actually refresh at 45 hz,

It's possible to set arbitrary refresh rates in Nvidia control panel right?",SteamDeck
jhp5053,"I didn't do anything special. I just modified the resolution in the launch options like you said you did. Downscaling essentially just adds some anti aliasing by default - but it's not going to fix every jaggy, it's just a nice little improvement. I only game on the deck itself.",SteamDeck
jho2k4p,Ah thanks - that makes sense - the Deck truly is special!,SteamDeck
jho1sci,"I haven‚Äôt really used that in years, but you can try to force different refresh rates there, yes. But most screens don‚Äôt actually support arbitrary refresh rates, particularly not down to 45 fps. Best to look up what your display supports and then plan your target framerate accordingly.",SteamDeck
jhonjz4,"Absolutely. No regrets! 
Certainly dont spend my days playing just that, but having an install of Skyrim with 400 mods running smoothly at 40fps on a device that fits in my backpack that I can take anywhere, is just mindblowingly fun to me. And thats just one example of all the fun this piece of tech brings me.",SteamDeck
jho8ap0,Thanks! I love this feature on the deck so much I'd like to try and replicate it on Windows for more demanding games.,SteamDeck
jhooaxb,">install of Skyrim with 400 mods running

That's so awesome. I've no idea where to start with Skyrim modding on the deck or even which version to use...",SteamDeck
jhoa2m6,"If your screen supports higher refresh rates, you can achieve a similar effect (e.g. if you set it to 90 hz and the game to 45 fps, it can just display each frame twice, still achieving even frame pacing).",SteamDeck
jhp0msf,"Have a looksy here;

https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/world/20230324-OYT1T50319 (Translate it using Deepl.com if you need to)

While on the same day (25th of March this year btw.) Dmytro Kuleba (Ukraines foreign minister) assured Austrian media, that they were ENTIRELY ready for seize fire talks, it was just the russians who would never agree to those at this point.
https://www.diepresse.com/6267911/aussenminister-dmytro-kuleba-heute-ist-jeder-ukrainer-eine-waffe (Translate it using Deepl.com if you need to.)

Thats the same Kuleba who held a press conference in Davos last year (ups that video is now ""private"" www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKp92a07nQ0 ), where he stated, that everyone one of the european heads of state would be encouraged, to broker seize fire negotiation, its just that - they cant touch on Ukraines territorial integrity at all, and also not touch conflict lines, because they should stay as they are.

Yesterday Selenskyj admitted, that Bachmut held strategic importance after four months of stating the exact opposite, and let me guess, I should now celebrate the Steam  Deck being used for mowing down people.

jho8pjd,"So fill me in.

The journalist that was in Mariupol reporting the first days of war, met the Ukrainian Police twice, as of this Al Jazeera interview: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/21/names-on-a-list-fleeing-mariupol-one-checkpoint-at-a-time

Then produced this video footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGb9ty4O0tw

Then the Crew fled from Mariopol ""in a Hyundai"". After being rescued (its a long story, read Al Jazeera).

The video footage was subsequently cut into a documentary movie, produced by CBS frontline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnydTKb-TYc (Chernov already ""had a concept for it"" src: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnydTKb-TYc ), and premiered at the sundance film festival.

But not before the crew had admitted, that they were frequently driven around in Mariupol by the ""patrol police"", and even taken to their headquaters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1C4EnguOWA

Not before I personally found out, that the trailer of the 20 days in Mariopol documentary included a police officer with a ""police headquater donezk region"" emblem on his jacket, who told the journalists what to do. And who strangely enough ""was protecting the wifi in a hospital near the front in Mariupol"", when the Chernov journalist crew ""found him"". Dont worry, he vanished from the story shortly after.

And only shortly before Chernov himself admitted, that they were driven out of Mariopol by their police handler (Vladimir) in the Sundance press circuit (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmKpX5pn-4I ). Only eight months later. Which strangely enough he forgot to mention in the Al Jazeera Interview that went around the world. In a Hyundai I presume?

And then I find out that the patrol police is the once instance in the Ukraine currently that permits journalists were to go and were not to go to, and that you need permission from them to film anywhere in the Ukraine at all. This video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4ZEif2ZECk

While Chernov is later featured on the newly registered website https://www.russianwarcrimeshouse.org/ as an ""art project"". Which is registered by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation

which normally organizes Events like these:

So I'm in no danger of being drafted.

But those smiles, when the US officials talk about ""Austria being neutral, but then not neutral haha---"" send chills down my spine every time I encounter them.

Because according to our constitution, we are neutral.

And the US is playing world police again.

Sending the Ukrainians 300 millions worth of weapon shipments in the year before the war started, then telling russia, they should leave Ukraine entirely in a NATO congregation with the Ukrainian foreign minister in december, before the war started, otherwise, they would not stop their weapon shipments.

All of Ukraine includes Crima, which the majority of my country agrees should not be the target of Ukrainian war aims. Because recapturing it, will end russias military power projection capabilities into the southern hemisphere (military harbor at Sevastopol see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgMPIhBLp1I).

Thats what the war currently is about. To destroy russia as a geopolitical power.

Thats what ""territorial integrity of Ukraine"" means to the US.

There are European Parlament Research service drafts, that the regions currently captured by russia would not add in any major way to Ukraines economic survival.

And they have a black see harbor under their control with Mariupol (actually important for Ukraines economic projection).

So now its about ""protecting the people from russian indoctrination"", and good against evil. And potential second attacks from Russia in the future that would be catastrophic to ukrainian survival, which have to be prevented, by killing 180.000 more people.

We would literally bike 15+ miles around the city or cities. Technology was TV, VHS and for the super lucky an NES. And TV would go off the air at midnight. Technology just wasn't a big thing we grew up with and didn't really start becoming a major thing until after I graduated. Hell I graduated school before people had cellphones.

If I was to do it again I‚Äôd recommend probably emulating subsistence on PCSX2.

Regarding your setup - is there a reason the Steam Deck mount is so far off-center? I would also suggest to add some kind of cable guide on the sides for the charging cable.

I wish you a fast recovery!",SteamDeck

jhnwvum,"with wine and the `bottles` program  https://usebottles.com/ as a wine front end , many can work.


Disk based copy protection can still be an issue however.",SteamDeck
jhnwt1v,"Yeah, either connect an optical drive to your Deck using USB, or make an .ISO of the discs and mount those on the Deck.

Haven't checked the video, but take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVbB5v6_cwk). If that doesn't help you, then you know what to look for.

Make an ISO: https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-an-iso-file-from-a-cd-or-dvd-on-any-operating-system/ - first result on Google, there might be better guides, but again, now you know what to look for.

In the case of Mass Effect and the GTA's, I figure that it's probably easier to install them from Steam, and I figure that GTA 4 and 5 are probably Steam keys anyways, so you probably have no use for the discs.

Don't know about Sega Rally though.

Oh yeah, once you've either mounted the ISO or have the discs in an optical drive, you can find a guide for how to add non-Steam games like this. There are quite a few in this sub. But basically you just add the setup file to Steam, run it, and replace it with the setup file with the .exe file once the game is installed.",SteamDeck
jhnz8n9,"You'll obviously need a USB DVD-Rom drivre, just copy the contents of disc into a folder to run the installer in something like Lutris or Bottles.

Once installed you'll most likely need to google the game + nocd to find a crack to run the game without the disc.

Personally my first move would be how expensive, if available, the game would be to repurchase on Steam or GOG.",SteamDeck
jhom0t6,"So this isn't completely what you asked so ignore it if it doesn't apply to you, but I found some places will give you the game on their launcher if you own the old disc. I had Spore and Dead Space 2 on disc, so I called up EA and told them I couldn't access them anymore since they were registered to some very old computers. They just added the games to my Origin account.",SteamDeck
jhox0lz,"Here, this is what the Saturn version looks like.  I didn't do any tweaking or anything.  This was drag and drop.

jhomjxr,I'll take a stab in getting Sega Rally working for you.,SteamDeck
jhp2ubj,I had success installing cd/dvd games with lutris... However... If you need to switch to disc 2 for example there's a high chance you get an error when they to switch. But installing on a windows laptop and just copying the game up worked perfectly.,SteamDeck
jho35qe,"Assuming you can't find a NoCD crack, within a bottle you can just decompress your ISO to your `d:` ""drive.""",SteamDeck
jho1lcj,"OK that sounds reasonably straight forward. I've got an optical drive, just a USB jobbie but should suffice as I've used it before. It's mainly for the Sega Rally disc I want to try it as I could play that game forever, I doubt it's going to work as it had issues running on Windows 10 even but I'll give it a go. Other option for that is to get the Saturn version out of the loft and emulate I guess.

The Gta and Mass Effect games will probably be easier via steam, I guess I could always wait for a sale and also sell the disc's as they seem to go for a few quid on ebay - just winds me up the number of hoops you have to jump through and dif accounts you seem to need just to ay an offline (for me anyway) adventure game üòí",SteamDeck
jho3nq4,"While I object on principle for paying for a digital copy of the game I already own, it is worth noting that many of these titles were rerelased at some point as freeware. See: cncnet, a decent number of Blizzard titles and all of id Software's back catalog.",SteamDeck

If there is a console version?  I would seriously look at that.  Saturn stuff emulates pretty well.",SteamDeck
jho2wq7,"Have you checked the serial codes on GTA and Mass Effect? There's a very good chance that those are for activating the games on Steam, or another launcher. Or that you can activate them on Steam, and don't have to buy the games again.

I can't be sure, but when GTA 4 was launched Steam had been selling games for some years already.",SteamDeck

1. Diablo II Resurrected - Absolutely amazing on the SD and works great for playing either online or single player with no connection required.
2. Dauntless - Super fun to play mobile, although an internet connection is required, works flawlessly tethered to my phone with minimal lag
3. Hitman Trilogy - All of these games run great on the deck. Until this past year I've never played a single one of these games but absolutely loved them. I think you can play this with no internet connection, but  I can't remember.
4. The Division 2 - Runs smoothly on deck but it's definitely a battery sucker. I find shooters to be quite difficult on controllers, but since this is mostly PvM I don't mind so much. Requires internet connection to play. 
5. Madden 2022 / 23 - I don't even watch football, but for some reason football games are fun. Runs great, no internet connection required. 
6. Super Mega Baseball 3 - Very stylized, light, and fun baseball game. No internet connection required.
7. Mortal Shell - Runs pretty great. I've only put about 3 hours or so into this game, though, so I'm not sure how it fairs later on in the game. I got really confused with navigation and kept running around in circles and haven't picked it back up since. I should probably just ready some guides or something, because it was quite fun.

All of these, with the exception of Diablo II, are running off of an micro SD card running Windows 10. Games like Division 2  and Dauntless need Easy Anti Cheat and that doesn't work on Steam OS. Pretty amazing having a handheld Windows machine.",SteamDeck
jhk13vd," Many games meet those requirements, and then it's a matter of taste. But now I'm playing the vanilla version of Fallout 4 and it's pretty awesome. Fixed 60 FPS, both indoors and outdoors, with a mix of mids and highs. It looks and feels really great.

jhlu5gn,"Here's my list of ""solid 60fps, cloud saves, 16:10, great controller support, excellent battery life for the Steam Deck"" games.

^(Prices are in USD, Steam review score included using the 'All Time' metric, not 'recent'.)

**The Ramp** *- 96% Positive, $5.99*

Very simple 'time killer' game. There's 4 ramps, and you ride a skateboard around on them. Perform simple tricks. You could say 'end game' is when you 100% the achievements. Runs perfectly on the Deck and entertained me for about 3 hours. [Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1506510/The_Ramp/)

**AER Memories of Old** *- 87% Positive, $1.49 (90% OFF)*

Beautiful short story based puzzle game. Simple but pretty art style, and you get to transform into a bird at will and fly around in a floating island world. Sound mixing is incredible and sounds great on the Deck. [Steam Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/331870/AER_Memories_of_Old/)

**Absolute Drift** *- 90% Positive, $11.99*

Top down driving game where the goal is to drift with precision through obstacle courses. Very hard game at first but as you master the drifting mechanics, it's incredibly satisfying to perform very low drifts through narrow bending tracks and specifically run your car over targets. [Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320140/Absolute_Drift)

**Lara Croft GO** *- 93% Positive, $1.99 (80% OFF)*

Tomb Raider as a turn based puzzle game. Excellent visuals, music and sounds and puzzles I personally found interesting and challenging until the very end. [Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/540840/Lara_Croft_GO/)

**Jazz Punk** *- 93% Positive, $14.99*

A comedy game with a plot so strange I'm not sure I could describe it here. It's basically 'fun easter eggs: the game', everything you can find that you can interact with usually unlocks some gag or funny moment. Very enjoyable romp. [Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250260/Jazzpunk_Directors_Cut/)",SteamDeck
jhlujuk,Warhammer 40k: Space Marine I think ticks all of these boxes. Technically it runs in 8:5 at 720,SteamDeck
jhigyr0,"I 100% recommend Hades, but it runs at 16:9.",SteamDeck
jhj0lr7,"Hades for sure. If you make use of the back buttons on the Steam Deck, you can even pull off some moves with certain weapons that would be impossible or close to it on a regular controller.",SteamDeck
jhkfl6m,"I'm just bummed it doesn't seem to work offline. This is one that's perfect for ""on the go"" type gaming but whatever is going on with save files ruins it.",SteamDeck
jhk0dv2,"That‚Äôs one game I don‚Äôt get the hype over, tried it on Xbox one and my Deck but I find it very meh.",SteamDeck
jhja015,It‚Äôs bizarre to me that MGSV almost feels more at home as a portable game. I guess it‚Äôs that leftover peace walker mission structure. Regardless I certainly agree.,SteamDeck
jhk0bvs,More people should play Rollerdrome,SteamDeck
jhj57yl,"How does MGS5 play? Does the steam deck sound like a jet engine when playing it at 60? 

It‚Äôs my first handheld so afraid to push it",SteamDeck
jhjsefk,MGSV was one of the first games I tried after I got my SD and when I first got into it I couldn't believe that it runs consistently at 60fps on good settings on top of quick load times. Seriously good optimisation in that game.,SteamDeck
jhildk6,Persona 5 is not 16:10,SteamDeck
jhjwnve,Came to post this. Runs absolutely perfect. Decked and bt controller were great on my recent work trip.,SteamDeck
jhkgbf9,"Ya but relating to the post -for some reason graphic settings get saved between devises, so annoying! But yes it runs pretty solid and looks great. Generally 30 fps with ray tracing enabled. (Utilizing cryo utilities)",SteamDeck
jhkkxf9,"""Rip and Tear"" sounds like my last trip to the urologist.",SteamDeck
jhjjwsg,"Came here to say this, just installed it yesterday",SteamDeck
jhj6wl3,I‚Äôm def going to play through it again on the deck at some point,SteamDeck
jhjtf9c,"Great game but it‚Äôs not perfect for steam deck, it‚Äôs too precise of a shooter to be good on twin sticks.",SteamDeck
jhkhark,I couldn't aim for shit when I tried this on the deck.  I straight up need an aim-bot,SteamDeck
jhjs261,I‚Äôm playing through right now,SteamDeck
jhk0dgm,Do you need to play half life 1 before 2?,SteamDeck
jhk888s,I want to but I have to finish Black Mesa but it‚Äôs so hard,SteamDeck
jhjgmtw,This is waaaay too fucking low,SteamDeck
jhk2k7e,"To me, this is a 'big screen, big sound, immersive experience' kinda game, rather than a 'small screen, portable' kinda game. but different strokes!",SteamDeck
jhij40x,"I've had issues with Dead Cells' sound being significantly delayed after coming out of suspension. Not sure if anyone else has had this, but it's rather annoying.",SteamDeck
jhk3hsj,Tetris Effect is SO FRAKING GOOD!,SteamDeck
jhko1cw,With Tetris Effect  I had to zoom in a bit on the settings as my eyesight isn't great.,SteamDeck
jhkyb24,"Yes to Tetris Effect, such a fantastic game!!",SteamDeck
jhiyrnm,My only complaint about Dead Cells is that when I bump my mouse while docked I lose controller support until I restart the game.,SteamDeck
jhkrzyg,"Oh wow. Never heard of this game but it‚Äôs reminding me of one of my all time favorites, Burnout Takedown.",SteamDeck
jhjgamm,Second this! And is one of my show of Steamdeck Games. Runs and looks soo good on the Deck!,SteamDeck
jhjx1to,"Does this game have a good campaign/story mode? 

Not one for online multiplayer",SteamDeck
jhk8v9o,This is my game to show people how awesome the deck is. Looks and feels amazing.,SteamDeck
jhl32lk,Having a Wreckfest lan party this weekend and I'm pretty pumped.,SteamDeck

jhj67to,Mine won't even launch on the deck. When's the last time you tried?,SteamDeck
jhinfli,There is still ppl on this game?,SteamDeck
jhjsn6w,All I need to hear,SteamDeck
jhlfmr0,I noticed I was able to still play with 60 FPS with the deck's CPU and GPU limited as much as possible. Which blew my mind.,SteamDeck
jhmcxg9,That is how I lost the steam deck to my wife.,SteamDeck
jhjvty8,"Ace combat was a real surprise to me, loved playing through that! Never expected the story to be so engaging in a plane warfare game",SteamDeck
jhlv9bz,Seconding ace combat 7. It pulls more watts than any other game I‚Äôve got but it‚Äôll do 60 fps no problem.,SteamDeck
jhmu078,"> Darkest Dungeon

I actually found it to be extremely uncomfortable to play DD on the SD... The controls felt like I was wasting time compared to just using a mouse, and even testing several community control schemes I found it really hard to actually use proper skills and target enemies...",SteamDeck
jhk88uf,"Played L4D2 on the deck and I didn‚Äôt like it there. 
For me the handling was not good enough and you feel that it was designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard.",SteamDeck
jhkth6m,"With no tinkering, I'm having stuttering on Vampire Survivors.",SteamDeck
jhlk5g1,"Desk Job was such a blast I had my son, sister, her husband, and my dad, who doesn't play video games, all play it and they thought it was a riot.",SteamDeck
jhj9oow,Haven‚Äôt played it on the deck but 100% it on my Xbox. I am waiting for Silksong so badly. I love this series. Quite possibly my favorite game in the last 10 years.,SteamDeck
jhjye4v,One of the best games ever.,SteamDeck
jhisbhu,This. One of the best experiences I've had on the Steam Deck and in gaming as a whole. Can't wait for Silksong!,SteamDeck
jhjwgtq,16:9 bro.,SteamDeck
jhlve3v,What am I missing? Played it a few hours and just‚Ä¶ stopped for other games.,SteamDeck
jhj0x2e,How did you get Arkham Asylum running well? I remember having to do some voodoo to even get it to launch and then the next day it stopped working for me.,SteamDeck
jhl71jt,"I played the entire series on the Deck a well. I had never played Arkham Origins since back in the day I said ""it isn't a real Arkham game""... Now I actually like it more than City.",SteamDeck
jhk76ky,Can't recommend this enough. I played it on game pass and was hooked!,SteamDeck
jhj5tjm,Very cool game indeed,SteamDeck
jhlyxls,"I've been contemplating getting this game. Concept looks cool and I love John Wick. Every time I see it on Steam sales I makeup excuses to not get it. Next time, that won't be the case.",SteamDeck
jhkrunb,My favorite game of 2022 and played the entire thing on the deck. Totally my speed for a steamdeck game.,SteamDeck
jhk6v9v,"Cool, just picked it up on the sale.",SteamDeck
jhix0iu,"Are you sure about 16:10 ratio? It's already a while ago that I played it on the deck, but if I remember correctly, there was a black bar on the top and bottom of the screen.",SteamDeck
jhis5fh,Played the first one soon after getting my Steam Deck. Recently got WotW on a discount. Can't wait to give it a try!,SteamDeck
jhj5kp4,"I prefer the first one tbf. Mainly because even if simplier, it feels more original in abundance of metroidvanias and rouge likes.",SteamDeck
jhk9c44,I am a huge fan of ori . But I find the screen in the deck a tad too small for it.,SteamDeck
jhipoh5,Been playing that myself. Fuck that game is gorgeous!,SteamDeck
jhkz7l4,Prey is an absolute masterpiece on the steamdeck. Cant recommend this game enough.,SteamDeck
jhjrwkb,I've been curious about Zomboid.  Doesn't it's inventory management make it a pain with the deck controls?,SteamDeck
jhinf4g,you have to tweak anything to get mafia 1 running 60fps? i had everything graphics wise on low but was still dipping way below 40 sometimes,SteamDeck
jhjejvl,red faction guerilla. so many hours played on that game on the 360 when i was younger lol. even the multiplayer was fun at the time,SteamDeck
jhk7vv3,mad max always crashes for me not long after the opening scene but for everyone else it seems to run fine. any ideas why that‚Äôs happening? any help would be appreciated because i‚Äôve heard great things about the game and am dying to play it,SteamDeck
jhkfh8e,"Mad Max never really got the respect that it should of. Awesome game, combat and driving.",SteamDeck
jhkjew0,"I'm voting against mad max, I found it super boring and fetch quest heavy",SteamDeck
jhk3ibn,Great little game. Runs superbly.,SteamDeck
jhkapxk,Literally just started this. It‚Äôs fantastic - such a perfect little platformer.,SteamDeck
jhkn041,This. Tinykin is so good. Really take your time with it cause it‚Äôs not the longest but it really rewards exploring and creativity.,SteamDeck
jhl7a2o,"Played it for the first time on the Deck, almost exclusively docked in the living room. Great experience. One of the most impactful endings of any game I've played.",SteamDeck
jhm3u2e,"Came here to say this! Personally I find DE plays better on the deck then pc in terms of controls, tho tbf I played it on the deck first. Regardless it‚Äôs an absolute amazing RPG, can‚Äôt recommend it enough!",SteamDeck
jhkr4um,"I say this on every post, a real gem of a game, 

You can get 60fps easy, but I recommend locking it at 45fps, it doesn't negatively impact the game and really stretches the battery life, I get 3 to 4 hours on one charge",SteamDeck
jhjhtqs,Scott Johnson fan?,SteamDeck
jhkdx5s,"Great game, updating Proton made it load a whole lot faster for me.",SteamDeck
jhkcn6v,Agreed! A hidden rpg gem and runs really nicely on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhk2m2t,"Oh, it's just had a big update!, thanks for the reminder",SteamDeck
jhkr7xu,Just bought on sale! No clue what the dude above me is talking about!,SteamDeck
jhknpbe,"Cult of the lamb is a terrible game. 

Sure, it might run well. And it might have enough battery life for just one more run. And the graphics might be cute.

But I‚Äôm done cleaning up puke and shit when I have 4 toilets, 2 cleaning stations, and only cook hearty meals. 

I‚Äôm going to start my own cult. With drug addicts and hookers. And I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be cleaner !",SteamDeck
jhil3ii,Alright you fucking got me ill check it out..Ive seen this game Mentioned about 100 times a day in this sub,SteamDeck
jhimpbk,"I Haven't played it for a couple of months, but doesn't the FPS tank towards the end of a run when the screen is full of a million things exploding?

That was my out of the box experience anyway",SteamDeck
jhjey58,"We say this, but the last 1/3 of every single run sees the game dropping to a solid >10fps.

Note: This really isn't an issue that affects gameplay.",SteamDeck
jhilxfw,It's a nice time killer.,SteamDeck
jhih5ii,"Pretty much every game runs perfectly well on the Steam Deck. If anything, I only had a handful of crashes during Sky the 3rd",SteamDeck
jhlsmff,"They all run great, just finished Sky the 3rd, started Zero a few days ago!",SteamDeck
jhk5sjr,I played this on the deck and it was out of this world. Definitely one of my favorite rpgs in a long time,SteamDeck
jhl13e7,"Absolutely. If you like turn-based JRPGs, this is going to quickly become a favorite.",SteamDeck
jhjslmj,"Only issue is that you can't run mods as easily as it should do. 

If you wanna just play the vanilla game, absolutely brilliant, but mods are a little awkward.",SteamDeck
jholqdv,Had a hard time getting into this game on desktop but I gave it another shot after getting my Steam deck and played for like 5 hours straight on the first day lol,SteamDeck
jhmhty7,This game is AWESOME. I didn't expect to get into a deck builder game the way I got into StS.,SteamDeck
jhk4y0h,"Did you ever manage to get the haptic feedback working for Sifu on the steam deck? It works on my pc with a dualshock4 but there‚Äôs none on the deck. It runs fantastic, but the game is just missing some of the impact without it.",SteamDeck
jhkapvn,"This game is so good I bought it on Epic Games launch day, then again on Steam.",SteamDeck
jhkglqa,Have you tried Bannerlord on it? Figured any M&B game wouldn't do well on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhkyhfu,"Ay that's a good shout man! I never thought of trying MnB, I'll give it a go! Do you know if any of the mods work well with SD or are they a bit iffy?",SteamDeck
jhnr99c,Also cemu (Wii u emulator). Just limit the fps to 30 and turn on vsync on settings and you get a perfect frame pacing,SteamDeck
jhklhve,Did the fix the achievements yet?  I know it supports multiplayer now but has not heard if achievements work yet.  Waiting on that before I beat them all on solo legendary again.,SteamDeck
jhly324,Came here to say this. Halo on handheld. Not much better.,SteamDeck
jhmog65,Absolutely brilliant all these years later. And on a fucking plane? Outstanding.,SteamDeck
jhkfucq,This is what I'm glad to hear since that's on about half price sale right now!,SteamDeck
jho4gau,"I had a ton of lag(bordering on freezing) with CE anniversary, is that a me problem or does it just need to load a few times to stabilize? I've never played Halo aside from a few multiplayer matches with friends who had an Xbox growing up and I'd love to actually experience the campaigns.",SteamDeck
jhk6243,"*Divinity Original Sin 2 to be more specific, Divinity 2 is in fact not applicable with SteamDeck. For any OG Larian fans.",SteamDeck
jhm9wcq,Playing this right now. I am loving it on steam deck!,SteamDeck
jhk5jh2,"MHR does run surprisingly well - there's a few FPS dips, but much better than I expected especially with its SD Verified status only being ""playable"".",SteamDeck
jhkvple,Sad that 2 runs like shit,SteamDeck
jhky5ma,Any post-5 Yakuza game has been pretty great. 6 was showing as unsupported but I never had any issues on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhl2m3z,"I *just* finished getting all the achievements in that one. Best VS-like I've played! It's funny, has great art, and some good chiptunes!

Up next I have Rogue: Genesia...after 100%ing the new VS DLC, lol",SteamDeck
jhmnu6y,"This is my recommendation, very addictive and I love the classes help to differentiate play styles. I‚Äôm almost tempted to say it‚Äôs better than vampire survivors‚Ä¶",SteamDeck
jhl7jw6,Mama Mia,SteamDeck
jhipm8a,"It's 16:10 for a very good reason: It needs to be 768 or higher vertical pixels because of old game compatibility (the vast majority of games on Steam). The default resolutions for older games are 640x480, 800x600, then 1024x768. If they went with a higher resolution screen that would solve the trick, but this was the lowest resolution screen they could have gone with while still supporting 1024x768 for compatibility reasons.",SteamDeck
jhixwe4,"I‚Äôm the opposite, I love the 16:10 aspect ratio when games support it, so refreshing and that vertical space is very useful in shooters for example.",SteamDeck
jhisnal,"It sucks but I think the solution is that more games should natively support 16:10, though i can understand the annoyance of older titles that do make you wish for a 16:9 display. Steamdecks rise in popularity and rise in support by game developers who primarily put their games on there are more likely to support 16:10 in the coming years, in fact I would be surprised if hades 2 for example didn't support it on launch which originally had no support in the first, now a popular recommended game for steamdeck. This is just speculation, though, and I could be wrong and am partly coping. It just seems more plausible now than ever, considering previously they could not be bothered to support the minority who had 16:10 monitors for their desktop.",SteamDeck
jhii45b,It's honestly my biggest pet peeve with the SD. The games that utilize the 16:10 aspect ratio are awesome but when a game only supports 16:9 it drives me insane lol,SteamDeck
jhk18yc,"DRG is the best game out, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt run at a stable 60fps on the Steam Deck (just because OP specified that). Maybe if you turn everything all the way down? But it looks pretty grim like that. 

It‚Äôs still totally enjoyable on the SD either way. 

STONE",SteamDeck
jhmatkx,I‚Äôve wanted to play this game for a while but I have no friends to play with. Is matchmaking with rando‚Äôs a thing in this game?,SteamDeck
jhitruq,Rock and Stone to the Bone!,SteamDeck
jhk34rm,it says dredge in the post :D,SteamDeck
jhl7hh4,I've played this similar game called Vampire Survivors. You should check it out.,SteamDeck
jhiiptm,It's as rock solid as Kiryu's abs and his unwavering loyalty.,SteamDeck
jhipiwx,As solid as your \*D√¶ck,SteamDeck
jhinm8i,"Yakuza 0 runs like a dream on the deck, can confirm",SteamDeck
jhiyelf,"I went on his profile hoping to obtain photographic evidence, however I was unfortunately unsuccessful in doing so.",SteamDeck
jhjgj72,Let me also just add. While it works perfectly fine at 60fps. I prefer to play it at 40 to get an extra hour battery life out of it. But there is some weird frame pacing issue with the cutscenes at 40fps so make sure VSYNC is turned on to fix it.,SteamDeck
jhjg2du,"How do the other games play? I am looking to rebuy all of them on steam to replay on SD. I've checked ProtonDB, but lately it's not super reliable for determining how well something actually plays on it.",SteamDeck
jhk6zej,I've heard that Crisis Core Reunion has also been running phenomenally.,SteamDeck
jhmeyl0,Into the Breach is fantastic. Chess with giant robots and that feeling of ‚Äújust one more turn‚Äù over and over until it‚Äôs 3am. The only thing that sucks is that I have it on Epic and there‚Äôs no cloud saves so I lost my progress after a recent factory reset.,SteamDeck
jhlntq2,Isaac was the first thing I installed when I got my deck‚Ä¶ still gets more play than anything else,SteamDeck
jhiz4az,Playing on the deck made me love crafting that i already leveled half of them to 90 !!!,SteamDeck
jhisvve,Requires tinkering... other than that I agree with you. Runs so good on deck.,SteamDeck
jhiujjr,"Unfortunately, from those that I know from this list, re2 and P5 don't support 16:10, agreed on the 40fps though, but at that point, we would just be recommending games as so many work just fine with a 16:9 40fps criteria.

Also, thank you for mentioning metal gear rising, I honestly had no idea it was even on steam and planned to emulate it like the others that are stuck on ps3",SteamDeck
jhj3rdt,"I really tried to like ‚ÄúHave a Nice Death‚Äù as I‚Äôve loved other Rogue-likes such as Rogue Legacy, Hades, Dead Cells, etc. I don‚Äôt know why, but this one really just didn‚Äôt click with me at all. Nothing to do with the SD, it ran completely fine on it. Just something about the gameplay itself that doesn‚Äôt work for some reason. Hopefully other enjoy it though, seems really well made.",SteamDeck
jhmbiin,How much modification to controls did you need to make? I would love to have some paradox games to kill time with on my deck but intimidated to remap all the controls.,SteamDeck
jhiwk5z,Dwarf Fortress is good? Is the text legible? Still waiting on my Deck but I've been wondering how DF would look and control.,SteamDeck
jhkx1nl,Unfortunately it is no longer available for purchase.,SteamDeck
jhk602s,10 fps?,SteamDeck
jhj2laf,How's MD now? Last time I played it was on GamePass back in 2021. Is it easy to navigate menus with touchpads on a small screen?,SteamDeck
jhlfvm9,"I wish I could enjoy games like this on the go but when you have a virpil hotas setup at home, controller setups just feel gross. Have been enjoying tanks in war thunder though.",SteamDeck
jhijzc4,Yeah you're right RDR2 checks everything except 60 fps. Probably the most impressive game on the SD,SteamDeck
jhjetj3,Apart from TLOU üòÖ,SteamDeck
jhk1qd5,"None of the support 16:10, DS2 & DS3 don't have cloud saves and DS3 can't hold 60fps on the Deck.",SteamDeck
jhlofsa,First you say? Nice flex.,SteamDeck
jhiq7aw,How does valheim work flawlessly? You can either nuke the graphics or run it at 45 fps.  It also drains your battery in 90 minutes.,SteamDeck
jhj46un,Project zomboid runs fine but controls are rubbish out of the box. Navigating inventories with buttons is painful and trackpad as mouse doesn't work properly with drag and drop.,SteamDeck
jhiv75d,can you play division 2 in offline mode?,SteamDeck
jhjxk6t,"To me tinkering is more like changing Proton versions, or going into desktop to configure something. Changing in game settings don't really count.",SteamDeck
jhjxbhf,"Yeah a lot of people seem to be ignoring my prompt. A lot of games don't have 16:10, or their cloud saves also save graphics configs so switching between PC can be a pain. I was kind of looking for more specific examples",SteamDeck
jhjy9vu,"Seconding this, it feels made FOR Steam Deck",SteamDeck
jhkpnbw,Just from the video of the game‚Ä¶ I must say that‚Ä¶ it looks amazing! It also looks difficult‚Ä¶,SteamDeck
jhj0u10,Strangely when I reduce the resolution to 720p it stretches to fill the 16:10 aspect,SteamDeck
jhjtvae,You can run it in 16:10 using this https://github.com/nbusseneau/hephaistos,SteamDeck
jhii8cu,Yeah Hades comes extremely close besides the 16:9. I know there is a mod for 16:10 but does it disable achievements?,SteamDeck
jhjrdt1,"Honestly I prefer 16:9 on the deck bc then I can get the performance overlay without covering the game screen. 

But ya, hades is a 10/10 recommend.",SteamDeck
jhj7s7c,Oh? I'm interested to hear those moves üëÄ,SteamDeck
jhkkytr,"Mine worked perfectly offline. Went back online, cloudsync and done.",SteamDeck
jhk2r5n,"It has beautiful art, a few noticeable songs and a tight core gameplay loop.

You get to discover a bit more of their version of the Greek mythos which is really satisfying. 

I can see how the game is a bit like dark souls in that you love or hate it since you could boil it down to souls lite or a different binding of Isaac. 

Right now it's my go-to alongside Jedi Fallen Order during my commute.",SteamDeck
jhjk1q1,The optimisation for PC was stellar compare to many other AAA port,SteamDeck
jhjdowp,"right? i love metal gear just never got round to playing V. had it in my library for sooo long with about 10hrs logged. I liked it, just other games kept grabbing my attention. soon as i got a deck i tried it out & RINSED it

actually glad i waited & got to play it first on the deck. same with a few other games like Hitman 2 & Yakuza games",SteamDeck
jhk7c1d,heck yes! so much fun,SteamDeck
jhj6joi,"MGS5 is ***very*** well optimized and runs at 60 fps easy. 

If you tweak some settings you can get it to run at like 10-13 watts.",SteamDeck
jhj5uxv,"Don‚Äôt be afraid to push it! No game you play will just break your deck, it‚Äôs there to be played on. It‚Äôs more then capable of running even newer games which demand alot more power from the deck (look at cyberpunk running 30fps on it). These titles i listed are all on last gen consoles, besides rollerdrome.

Runs great at 60! I never noticed the fan noise while playing, so either they weren‚Äôt too loud or i had the speakers up loud enough to mask it. Either way you‚Äôll have a great time with it if you like stealth games. I got 94hrs out of it, most of it on the deck.

You can get it for under a fiver on 3rd party sites, or around the same when it‚Äôs on sale on steam",SteamDeck
jhj8luq,Nah doesn‚Äôt get too loud and surprisingly gets a lot more battery than other comparable titles I‚Äôve tried.,SteamDeck
jhjae07,"Like the other guy said, you won‚Äôt push it with most stuff, and it‚Äôs also true that you will *never* break your Deck that way. It‚Äôs designed to shutoff before any point of bad stuff happening is reached. If it makes you feel any better, I played 130 hours of Death Stranding on Deck - which is demanding af and at times horribly optimized for the Deck - and all was well. Temps were high at times but nothing happened. 

It handles MGSV fine though. Didn‚Äôt mess with any settings and 60 FPS just seems to work.",SteamDeck
jhjzceh,MGS V actually isn‚Äôt that demanding. It‚Äôs easy to forget it‚Äôs actually a ps3/360 generation game,SteamDeck
jhilkbv,"ah i forgot that, besides that & the graphics options staying (not tested so just assuming) they all work great. had so much fun playin em all on the deck",SteamDeck
jhkknkj,You can run this at 4K60. I played docked on the OLED.,SteamDeck

jhkewqb,"Definitely don't need to. You will find plenty of good summaries of the story, both video and written. It's entertaining, though even that isn't necessary to enjoy HL2.

If you end up loving HL2 (it's great), you can go back and play Black Mesa (Valve approved fan made update on the game).

It's also worth watching Freeman's Mind if you find yourself enjoying the HL universe.

jhob71t,"In fairness to OP's question it's not 100% perfect. It's probably 95% fine but there are a few little issues.

I occasionally get a little lower frame rate when there's a lot of action going on. It's only slight and doesn't take me out of the gameplay but it is noticeable.

It's needed to either enable or disable anti-cheat on launch to get that to work (the launch options for it are reversed - theres a post on halo waypoint for April 2023 explaining it).
I believe anti-cheat also affects achievements - I got them to work once but can't remember how...

I haven't played multiplayer at all so can't comment on that.

But the campaign is totally playable without any major issues, controls are great, load time for levels was maybe 5 seconds at the longest. So far I've played through halo reach, 1, 2, and 3 on legendary.

The only real issue I've found is that sometimes MCC freezes on exit. But this doesn't seem to affect saving at all, and that issue may have been solved with the latest proton version.

I'm sure all this this has already been commented elsewhere on this subreddit or r/halo, but hope this helps anyway :)",SteamDeck

jhnqp89,"Mod author here :)

/u/DeckerSteam already gave the short answer, but I have a FAQ entry dedicated to answering that so I'll just copy/paste it in case you want more details about why / when modding would disable achievements in a game:

> ### Do achievements still work when using Hephaistos?
> 
> **Short answer:** Yes. Hades uses client-side achievements (i.e. achievements are managed by the game, not by Steam / Epic Games / Microsoft Store) and Hephaistos does not touch anything achievements-related: achievements still work exactly like in the original game.
> 
> **Longer answer:** No matter the platform (Steam, Epic Games, Microsoft Store), achievements can be of 2 types: client (offline checks) or server (online checks).
> 
> Client achievements are most common. In this mode, achievements are handled client-side (i.e. by the game), offline. There is no check or anything done by the platform: the client sends a message saying ""unlock X achievement on Y game"" and platform says ""sure"". This is why you can use [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) to unlock (and even relock) any client achievement of your choice without any consequences. Client achievements are basically ""we don't care if anyone cheats, this is only for fun"" achievements.
> 
> Server achievements are less common. In this mode, achievements are handled server-side (i.e. by the game server or the platform), online. This makes it harder to cheat achievements because the client does not have direct control over achievement checks. If the client (i.e. the game) is also tamper-protected (e.g. Steam's VAC system), then cheating is extremely hard / impossible. Server achievements are basically ""serious"" achievements.
> 
> Any game (no matter if offline or online) can use any type of achievements (client or server). There can even be a mix of both client and server achievements on the same game. With that said:
> 
> - Offline games will almost always use client achievements. It is very rare for offline games to use server achievements.
> - Online games will typically either:
>   - Use only client achievements (and rarely a few server achievements, usually newer achievements added after release).
>   - Use only server achievements (and rarely a few client achievements, usually older legacy achievements added before release).
> 
> In any case, the takeaway is that there is no reason any mod would disable achievements on any game without tamper-protection:
> 
> - Client achievements should not be disabled by the mod (unless you specifically use a mod that says it does that).
> - Server achievements cannot be disabled by the mod, period.
> 
> However, if the game does use tamper-protection, then you don't want to use any mod at all (even if the mod actually does nothing) because you'd get flagged just because your game has been modified.
> 
> In Hades' case, the game is offline, only uses client achievements, and is not tamper-protected. Hephaistos does not touch anything achievements-related: achievements still work exactly like in the original game, so you may do whatever you want with the achievements including using [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) to unlock / relock all of them if you please.",SteamDeck

Once I beat a certain boss >!mantis lords!< that helped me appreciate the controls and got to a certain area with a very cool concept >!City of Tears!< .I just fell in love.

It certainly helped for me that my favourite gaming experience up to that point was exploring the world of the first Dark Souls. Hollow Knight scratched that itch so goddamn well. It came so much closer to giving me that mixed feeling of thrill, fear and wonder that exploring DS1 did even compared to its sequels. 

I could go on forever about the similarities but Hallownest and Lordran are by far my 2 favourite game worlds ever. It helps that both games have very tight and engaging gameplay as well.

So TLDR I fell in love with Hollow Knight because it gave me a sense of wonder that I hadn't gotten from a game in years and didn't really know I'd even been chasing.",SteamDeck

jhmhzzc,"Yeah, it was Greenpath. True, it might be that further down the road I'd get more interested in it, but if after few hours the game doesn't seem to pull me in, then I feel like I'm forcing it. I don't have that much time these days and I am very picky when it comes to games, so I'd rather move to something that's really enjoying me.",SteamDeck
jhl6gfa,I'm so dumb. I just assumed all the enemies are vampires and you played as vampire hunters. Just saw that line as a throw away reference. Are there no vampires?,SteamDeck
jhl6k4d,I didn‚Äôt need to be called out like this lol,SteamDeck
jhlteyk,I‚Äôm sure there are. Many of the characters are a play on characters from the Castlevania series. One of them is based on Alucard from SotN. So at the very least there‚Äôs a half vampire as a playable character.,SteamDeck

(ps1) MGS (yes Im a metal gear fanatic lol), Crash, Spyro, FF9 (use save states lol), Resident Evil 1,2 & 3, 

(SNES) Zombies ate my Neighbors (short levels that you can blow threw in a few min VERY ADDICTING GAME PLAY!) Breath of fire, FF3(6), Legend Of Zelda link to the past, Mega Man X series, 

(Game Boy/Color) Pokemon (get them all once you play the 1st one you'll be hooked), Mario, Zelda, Tetris, 

(Sega Genesis) Sonic (get them all lol), Aladdin, Road Rash, Phantasy Star. I could go on all day with retro stuff the Steam Deck is amazing for emulation.

For more modern stuff,

Ion Fury, Dusk, Project Warlock, Shovel Night, Fallout 1 & 2, Diablo 1 & 2, Portal 1 & 2, Half-Life (And the expansions) Half-Life 2 (And the Episodes), Command And Conquer.

You can set a standard Proton version in the settings which will be used for games with the status ""unknown"" and ""unsupported"". If you change the standard Proton version (it will not automatically change to the newest version), it is then updated and used with that games.

Verified games (""verified"" and ""playable"") use a specific Proton version defined by Valve.

jhpedqa,"Hi community,

On the surface, this seems like an easy Project yet it took me well over 2 months to finish up.¬†

Let's just say compatibility is life's definition of a joke !¬†

Onto the main course:

Here is my wireless play setup.¬†

This is a wireless HDMI Transmitter/Receiver from the company Peakdo. They're great folks who stand behind their product. They helped me considerably along¬†the way! Kudos!¬†

So basically you wear the glasses and they wirelessly transmit what your steamdeck shows.¬†

You may even just use a wireless controller if the deck is too heavy or you'd like more mobility.¬†

Up to 10 Meters (30ft) from steamdeck to glasses.¬†

The OLED glasses project the steamdeck screen for about 12 to 13 hours per charge.¬†

FYI: When purchasing the Peakdo Wireless Transmitter P3s, you only get a transmitter and a receiver. I modded the receiver with a sizeable battery to last well over 12 hours !

Yes OLED steamdeck done!¬†

Now onto the STEAMDECK mods themselves:

DEVASO Backplate which magnetically houses a 100mm peltier Fan. Ptm7950 on APU and RAM and 3.5mm thick copper plate between the APU and Backplate.¬†

Silicon Lottery:

CPU 3850/2000 GPU¬†

(clocks reached while undervolted by -30/-40/-40)

Otherwise without undervolting I easily hit 4100/2200.¬†

35W TDP

6400mts on Micron RAM

The backplate is similar to Jsaux in principle yet with a 100mm circular aluminum plate as opposed to the rectangular smaller one on Jsaux.¬†

I only got this to match it with the fan and acheive superior cooling.¬†

For everything else, the quality on Jsaux is better.¬†

Temps with my overclock are 70c/71c on Cyberpunk. On less demanding games 61c/59c.¬†

While idle on home 29c!!!

Smaller touches will be added to get these temps even lower !

You can add proton badges through decky, and it will add a badge on the hero image of the games home page that gives you a good idea about how compatible the game is.

jhitdqs,"I've stopped buying games that require a third party launcher or require a connection to play as much.  
RDR2 handled offline play really well when I tried it. I just warned me that the launcher was offline and proceeded to load the game.

AC3 Remastered on the other hand just required too much effort to try and play offline, so it got refunded.

My rule going forward is that if it requires a third-party launcher that needs to be online I won't buy it until it is on sale for $5",SteamDeck
jhin5n0,"I still buy everything. So sadly it did not change it.
No seriously please help it's getting out of control.",SteamDeck
jhinhfc,Not really! I use Isthereanydeal. To find games I don't have! Fanatical & Humble bundles are my go-to! But I did just complete a recommendation - Pyre & Hades it's in a bundle that's meant to be good on deck.,SteamDeck
jhiori0,"sure does.

If it's on sale, and ""might"" run on steamdeck, I buy it.

my purchases since owning the steamdeck have increased 9001%",SteamDeck
jhitfdn,"Huge difference. I used to buy games wherever I could get them cheapest (steam, epic, ubi store, etc), but now I buy literally everything either directly from steam or from a storefront that redeems on steam. I've even re-purchased more games than I care to mention that I already owned, so I could play and manage them easier within steam.

I also buy way more indie titles than I used to and am now constantly hunting for more good steam deck games.",SteamDeck
jhitnsj,"Yes. I pretty much buy games on a discount. Get sad my backlog is growing. Try to fill the void by buying more games. Get sad again. 

Rinse & repeat",SteamDeck
jhitho5,I purchase a lot more on Steam than I used to. Definitely check compatability first too. Though I will still buy a game that isnt fully compatible. Most of the time it is just something like small fonts or  having to click through the initial setup that keeps it from being deck verified.,SteamDeck
jhitrbz,"It hasn't really changed my purchasing habits as much as it's rearranged them. I play on PC and on Switch, mainly. It used to be a pretty even mix between the two platforms. Now I buy almost everything through Steam and the Switch has been relegated only to exclusives.

Although, as far as PC goes, Steam was always my go-to storefront. I got the huge Itch.io charity bundle in 2020 and a few free games through Epic, but otherwise, my whole library is on Steam.",SteamDeck
jhiudpv,"I do \*steam deck support\* search on the game discussion first before adding to wishlist. 

Some game if I really like it and it is on sale, I will still buy even if there is not SD support cos I will play on my desktop.

But yeah, I now do always first look at the product page for the badge, then go to the discussion and do a search then add to wishlist or decide if I want to buy.",SteamDeck
jhkc4oi,[deleted],SteamDeck
jhio96a,"I buy what I missed out on from xbox one/ps4 but only when those games are on sale

I'm not buying games I've already played on other systems anymore and haven't for a while. It's just wasted time for me considering I've got a lot of games I've not played yet.",SteamDeck
jhit7nw,Technically. I mostly use my Steam Deck for Emulation. However I have bought 4 games for my deck in the span of almost a year. It previously took me about 5 years to purchase 4 games.,SteamDeck
jhj0cbh,"I‚Äôm buying more games after getting my deck, but more indies than anything.",SteamDeck
jhj2830,"I used to be relatively agnostic as to what ""store"" I bought my PC games from and just looked at the best price, best sale, grabbed stuff for free via Epic Games store, etc.

&#x200B;

Now I basically only consider Steam games due to the easy integration.  It also opened me up to a different ""type"" of game that I normally wouldn't buy too; I have a gaming PC with an Ultrawide so a lot of these pixel style games and games that are better with controllers I sort of never really played; now I seek them out.",SteamDeck
jhkwulb,"Nah not really. I just play my games a little more. There are some games I do purchase for the deck, that I once would purchase for my xbox controller, which I also still use for some games.

My account is also 19 years old and has 700+ games so I'm kinda 'down there' on possible games I can buy. I'm just happy i've extended my play hours a little bit so I can work on that backlog.",SteamDeck
jhitz6s,"I don't think I've bought anything on Steam since I got mine, other than the new Vampire Survivors DLC.

So.. no.

I *seriously* cut back on buying games on Steam when I realized I was never playing 90% of them.",SteamDeck

jhj3spw,"I held off buying games in 2022 so I could afford a Deck in 2023. Now I'm working on my enormous backlog and trying not to buy anything until I've made some progress on the games I already own.

The games on the top of my wishlist will still be there when I'm ready, and they'll probably have better sales when I finally get there.",SteamDeck
jhjdpak,"Stop using Steams verified system, and start using protonDB badges. If its gold/platinum you're good.",SteamDeck
jhjsy4e,I used to buy rpgs on switch if I could so I could play them at lunch. Now I buy a lot of those on pc,SteamDeck
jhkxgjb,My favorite games are deemed unsupported for the deck but they all run fine!,SteamDeck
jhkpzki,"Cloud Saves are huge for me. Steam Deck is my only device, and if the game doesn‚Äôt have save sync capabilities, I‚Äôm probably not even going to bother.",SteamDeck
jhindoj,"Considering I had never used steam, and now I peruse the store daly‚Ä¶ Yes it has made a big impact on my habits (and wallet)",SteamDeck
jhiuahb,Nah. I only buy from Steam during the big Sales. But the Deck certainly has me taking another look at all those games I bought and never played.,SteamDeck
jhiubly,"Yes & no, there are some games I'd prefer to experience on pc usually large demanding AAA titles my last 3 that come to mind are TLOU, RE4, and Hogwarts legacy. But I also find myself looking for titles to play in bed now. Some days I prefer gaming in bed other days I'm okay with sitting at my desk but at some point for some reason I'll grab my SD",SteamDeck
jhiubv4,Since it made me get Steam for the first time I‚Äôd say a solid yes.,SteamDeck
jhiuoio,"My PC slowly became relatively useless so I went from  buying steam games all the time (especially during sales) to completely stopping unless there was a good strategy game‚Ä¶ with the steam deck, I‚Äôve bought prob 50 games since I got it in the fall‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll ply 10 of them‚Ä¶",SteamDeck
jhiuyum,Yes i dont buy games anymore and just do emulation,SteamDeck
jhivajg,The Steam Deck didnt change my purchasing habits on steam. It made me start buying games on steam. Lol,SteamDeck
jhivb43,It makes me really want some more in-depth twin stick shooters with progression systems.,SteamDeck
jhivgnm,"Yes, if it's not supported by the deck, it's not supported by me.",SteamDeck
jhivjoo,"Before the Deck, I had a rickety old PC I built between 2013-2015 out of peer pressure as opposed to actually wanting to and didn‚Äôt upgrade it since. I used Steam for modded MGSV and an odd and end here and there for the longest time. Was a console gamer otherwise. 

Now here I am, 1TB SSD swap and a 1TB card later trying to consolidate my lifetime library to one spot‚Ä¶",SteamDeck
jhivjv4,"Slowly but surely. I used to not mind tinkering to make games work, but now if it's not one or two easy steps to get a game working I don't bother buying it",SteamDeck
jhivo00,"Yes, I buy far less than before, which probably wasn't that they intended with the 64GB but... I can use games I already own and emulators instead so :D",SteamDeck
jhivzm6,"In the sense that it's got me buying Steam games again since all the way back in 2013, yeah. That's around the time I got my PS4 and pretty much swore off PC gaming completely. Now I'm back to it.",SteamDeck
jhiyfjy,"Yes, I buy everything through Steam now. I used to buy a few games through their respective launchers, but now every purchase is through Steam.

Also, I always check protondb before buying anything now. If it doesn't work on SteamOS, it's a no go for me even though I have Windows installed on my Deck as well. Windows is for Warzone and BF2042, which I play with friends.

I've only bought 3 games (one was a repurchase) since I got my Steam Deck mid-Q3, and have mostly been plowing through backlog.",SteamDeck
jhiykca,I've been buying more games. I used to pirate on my desktop a lot and only bought games for multi-player or if I didn't wanna wait months for it to get cracked but pirating on steam deck can be tricky and sometimes the games just won't work and I'll end up actually buying them.,SteamDeck
jhiyrlj,"Heavy PC Gamer here. Only bought/had the consoles for their exclusives. Not really changed my purchasing habits, only looking somethimes for games that i plan on playing on the SD only. Usually games i can play without sound on the side when I watch something with my wife",SteamDeck
jhiz6r0,"I had a Steam account before getting the deck, and bought games pretty rarely. Now every week I'm looking for deals on something that looks interesting ü§£

It's also opened up the opportunity to find more local CoOp games to play together with my wife and kid on the big TV! Now I also want to buy all the controllers üòÇ

It has definitely changed my purchasing habits, but I would say in a positive way!",SteamDeck
jhizbre,I've sold all non-exclusive Switch game cartridges and purchased them on steam. I've earned a bit.,SteamDeck
jhiznr1,Yeah I stopped paying for game pass and bought the games on steam,SteamDeck
jhj0ed5,"I don‚Äôt pay any attention to ‚Äúplayable‚Äù or not games. All my main ones are not considered playable. Conan Exile, GTA V, and recently D2R. 

I buy more games from Steam now though - I also enjoy searching through and adding games to my wishlist",SteamDeck
jhj0wpz,"Slightly. I've always been in the camp of buying shitloads of indie games on PC, so that hasn't changed with the Deck.

Likewise, being cautious about the state of big ticket PC games before buying them has also been a thing long before the Deck was announced. However, the range of the games I do buy has been narrowed - for example, if the port is fine but it's just too intensive or has incompatible anticheat. Those titles are few and far between, though.",SteamDeck
jhj1j96,"Somewhat. I was gaming on Linux before, so I was already checking ProtonDB for compatibility and mainly buying from Steam. Now that the Steam Deck has become my primary gaming device I tend to go for games which work better for the hardware and controls too.",SteamDeck
jhj1tr7,"I have been buying and playing way more indie titles like Ion fury, Dusk, Elderborn, Blasphemous etc. Been absolutely loving them.",SteamDeck
jhj21r1,"Absolutely, I started my journey with SteamDeck and purchase Steam games with Deck compatibility in mind. yet, I'm currently playing Deathloop and No Man Sky on Xbox Game Pass (streaming through MS Edge on Deck). With a strong WiFi connection, this is a great way to try games. Two different environments on one device. Of course emulating is an option too. This tech continues to blow me away.",SteamDeck
jhj2a51,If it‚Äôs not gold or better on protondb I don‚Äôt even bother anymore,SteamDeck
jhj2toy,"Yeah, it did change my habits a lot. I usually only buy during sales anyway, but I look specifically for Steam Deck playable at least now.",SteamDeck
jhj32h7,"For me, the only thing it's changed is my gaming habits in general, I used to be a chronic CSGO addict, ever since the SteamDeck, I actually play my library of 1500 games; not the full library of course, but I tried 170 games last year, beaten 15 games! Got my first platinum since 2020! 

It kinda helped me have a healthier habit with CSGO, notice now though that if I can play a game on controller, I will play it on controller, and if it's got Cloud Saves, so I can go from PC to Deck and vice versa, if there's no cloud saves, we only install on the Deck and play from there. 

Purchasing habits; only checking for Cloud Save and whether it's unsupported or not, if it's unsupported, check ProtonDB, if truly unsupported, hold off on buying till deep discount. The only unsupported game I've bought was Modern Warfare II 2022 

Last 6 months here are my purchases that I spent my own money on, no bundles:

Persona 5 Royal  
Crysis Remastered 2/3 (Steam Deck not in mind)   
Resident Evil 8 Winter's Expansion  
Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection  
Spider-Man Miles Morales  
Dead Space 2023  
Resident Evil 4 2023  
Sifu   


I've always been a SteamDrone shill for years, but the Deck has given me an even bigger reason to refuse to use other stores, I'm not willing to put up with any headaches from other Storefronts and the Deck has given me an additional reason to never falter since no Cloud Save / Ez Install = no buy. Like Sifu! Could've gotten it cheaper on Epic, but I'd rather pay 10 extra euros for a Steam Installation.",SteamDeck
jhj382k,I had like 60 games. Over the past many years. Now I have more than double that amount. Only because of Steam Deck. But also was possible because of disposable income since I did not have that much before. I am just concerned if I am able to finish most of them...,SteamDeck
jhj3us2,"No not at all, but that's more because I have a good pc for streaming and stream any game that doesn't work to my deck so I don't need to really think about whether it's verified or not.",SteamDeck
jhj46gr,"I didn‚Äôt have a steam account before I bought the deck. ‚ÄúPlayable‚Äù and the other labels, I often ignore those and look on protondb instead.

jhj4gum,No. I still make irresponsible choices.,SteamDeck
jhj4iew,I had recently had gotten some control on my spending on games on sale but now I just want to buy everything.,SteamDeck
jhj4k3n,Yes. I spend more money on games overall.,SteamDeck
jhj4kgm,"Yeah, I buy a ton load of games that I probably will never play üòÇ",SteamDeck
jhj4kmw,Nah still buying the games I wanna play. But if it doesn‚Äôt run well on steam deck I play then I play on PC,SteamDeck
jhj4mji,Way more indies and less AAA,SteamDeck
jhj4riv,"I've... bought a lot more games... I used to just have a handful of games in my library that all had atleast 400-1000 hrs on them. I now have those games that I mean to play but will likely never... Congratulations Valve, you got me.",SteamDeck
jhj4whq,"I‚Äôve been buying games for it that I would normally get for a home console. 
even thought it would look/play better on the home console, because it‚Äôs just so hard to not play it anywhere, even if that just means my backyard.",SteamDeck
jhj5evf,"I've been buying more porn games since getting the deck. Always felt kinda weird to play them on a computer, even though my GF has her own, but SD is just more personal.",SteamDeck
jhj5j79,Yep. I don‚Äôt buy games from anywhere except Steam now.,SteamDeck
jhj694u,I definitely look to see if there are launchers now. God I hate those. If a game doesn't have one I'm way more likely to buy,SteamDeck
jhj7riw,I played thousands of hours of rogue likes before I got my deck. Got really burnt out after spending 900+ hours on ROTMG. Never thought I‚Äôd pick up another one again. Yet over the past year and a half of having a deck I have bought dozens of rl‚Äôs just for the enjoyability of being able to just kick back and have a nice half a hour-hour long session.,SteamDeck
jhj8hq2,"I started buying games on Steam again, after years being console exclusive.",SteamDeck
jhj8obu,Absolutely. I pretty much try to buy everyone on the deck now instead as long it works well.,SteamDeck
jhj8oio,I feel like it made my purchasing habits worse than without it. I feel like I buy at least one game every two weeks to a month depending on price now.,SteamDeck
jhj8s3e,Yes,SteamDeck
jhj96vl,"Yes! In the past Id just buy whatever game I wanted whenever I wanted.

Now I throw games on the wishlist and wait until they reach a price Im willing to pay.

Mostly because there are so many games I want to play on the deck that I have a large backlog now, and am in no rush to purchase more to simply add to the backlog - can afford to be patient :)",SteamDeck
jhj9guk,It did 100% what the Steam Deck was intended to do by being sold at a low cost as a lead item: make me buy more game on Steam. My library used to be a total of seven games. Now it's nearly double that.,SteamDeck
jhjbln6,Yes. I'm buying even more games that I'll not have time to play.,SteamDeck
jhjc2bo,I guess it has made me rebuy some older games or actually purchase some Gamepass games because I feel they would be great on the go or want to replay them but not in a traditional way on the PC or TV/console.,SteamDeck
jhjcbhu,"Yes, I'll buy more controller-centric games now, even if I end up playing them with my Xbox controller at my desk, and sometimes on my Steam Deck.

I was previously a nearly-exclusive KB+M gamer.",SteamDeck
jhjcxi3,I was moving back towards console gaming until I got the steam deck. So the steam deck has gotten me to go back to steam,SteamDeck
jhjd20p,"When I initially got my Steam Deck I hadn't logged into my account since shortly after Half Life 2 launched. I also played some Counter Strike Source when it first launched. 

Now I am buried in games I bought on sale. Since August I have bought over a hundred games that I will totally get around to playing.",SteamDeck
jhjejdt,"I barely bought games before my Steam Deck and I still don't. Only games I bought after it was the rest of the valve complete collection and briefly skyrim special edition which I returned since I decided just to use the original version. And the valve complete collection wasn't even because of the Steam Deck.

I just don't wanna buy too many games when I still have several other games I have yet to complete. Although I did consider getting beamng.drive just to have fun driving around whenever I wanted but decided against it for now.",SteamDeck
jhjfg9h,"Yes and no for me. I have a full-force gaming PC that I do my main gaming on like COD, BF, etc however when games go on sale with the Steam Sales when I'm looking then ill see if they are SD compatible, if they aren't I just move right along because those are games I will probably never play on my main PC.",SteamDeck
jhjfp5v,I've spent more money on steam haha,SteamDeck
jhjfx7l,"Yes, in an odd way. I have previously used Steam sometimes to pick up old games I could run on my laptop and occasionally games that were on sale that I couldn't play at the time but figured I would ether upgrade my to a PC or time would win out next for another laptop. 

Now I have no excuses to buy and wait, I can play things now I've had on Steam for almost a decade so I have been slowly going through my backlog, whether new experiences or replaying old favorites, Vanquish and Fable as of late. It's just been hard to justify anything really new when I have 200+ games to go through.",SteamDeck
jhjh2wm,"I‚Äôve always preferred to buy games that launch from Steam over other launchers, even if another launcher still runs from Steam. But the last few years I started being more open to just run games from other launchers. Got tired of paying the Steam tax. 

Since getting the Deck I‚Äôm back to preferring games that can launch from Steam. I‚Äôm not that into tinkering or going into Desktop mode so I‚Äôd rather just be able to manage games from Steam.

I do have the Blizzard launcher installed as well as Minecraft and Roblox so I‚Äôm willing to do it I just prefer not to.",SteamDeck
jhjhdui,"This is going to sound heretical, but it's actually gotten me to buy more Switch games. Not for an emulator, just for the Switch proper.

The Deck has made me realize that the convenience of a handheld is very valuable, more valuable than max graphics or 165fps.

So I play a lot of Steam games, but also play a lot of Switch games. It works out great because in a strangely un-Nintendo move they allow developers to sell digital keys places other than the eShop, so you can get games that are Steam-cheap. dekudeals.com helps find them. Don't get me wrong, I also buy and play more Steam games than before. isthereanydeal.com helps find those.

So yeah I buy more Steam games than before, but I also have become much more receptive to handheld ""low spec"" gaming in general. I used to get hung up on ""can I run the game at max? do I have to use DLSS? let me pull up afterburner and..."" and now I just think ""can I play the game?"" and that's good enough.",SteamDeck
jhji43h,"I already had an older gaming PC and a newer gaming laptop with quite a few games on STEAM.

Although I'd occasionally buy games on STEAM directly more often than not I buy through places like Humble Store as I subscribe to Humble Choice.

I have bought a few additional games through STEAM since getting my Deck, but these were already on my wishlist so would've bought them sooner or later anyway.",SteamDeck
jhjipqd,"A bit, just bought Shadows of Doubt which released today and I am getting with stuttering about 20-30 fps but it is sort of playable, the developers mentioned they want to get the green Verified tick so that made me buy the game.",SteamDeck
jhjiwjj,"Yea, got more jrpgs and indies",SteamDeck
jhjj5bo,"Nope, still buying shit then not playing it",SteamDeck
jhjjdzd,"Not really. I mostly play potato games (and my gaming PC is from 2015, so the top of the line games I was rocking back then might be potato tier these days ;\_; ), so any games I buy are almost guaranteed to work on Deck. I do think that new Steam games should make an effort to be Deck compatible, although I'm not sure how realistic that is. I bought Hogwarts Legacy on Steam because I saw it was Deck verified, but I didn't enjoy how it ran at all. Even tried connecting it to my dock to play it on my big TV like a console and what looked iffy on the actual Deck's screen looked a million times worse on the TV where I'm regularly playing my media in 4K.",SteamDeck
jhjjp3s,"Yes, now I only look for deck verified games to buy",SteamDeck
jhjkr7f,"I definetly consider that when buying. I always check ProtonDB and if a game has cloud saves, so I can switch between PC and the Deck (The constant disconnecting from WiFi and ""could not reach Steam servers"" is extra annoying  in that case tho).",SteamDeck
jhjlfys,I just look at YouTube if the game runs. Won't ever bother it the game has any kind of rating.,SteamDeck
jhjma25,"I have gamepass and absolutely would not have bought Vampire Survivors and just opted to stream it on my phone if I didn't have a SD.  I also wouldn't be rebuying the entire Yakuza series, which I own on PS4.",SteamDeck
jhjofoz,I mean yeah but in the opposite way. Steam deck has way better performance than my old pc. So I get to play all those games that didn't work or barely ran.,SteamDeck
jhjpuyn,I haven't bought a game in a month. The Steam Deck as a back log killer is working for me. I have like 3 games to beat before I buy something that will most likely wait.,SteamDeck
jhjq6bb,"Yeah I use it! 
Never bought anything on Steam in the 8 years membership before the Deck.",SteamDeck
jhjrj3r,"still the same, just buying when discount regardless i can play it or not now.. (maybe someday i'll play my other backup pc that still using windows)",SteamDeck
jhjs7j1,"Yes, because the Steam Deck is currently my main gaming device/the only device on which I can access most of my Steam games. My gaming PC has served admirably, but has reached the end of its gaming career (it can stream games on GFN, but that's about it), and I don't have the time, energy, or budget to build a new one.

How playable something is on Deck is a huge factor in whether I purchase, and I try to look closely at not only how playable it is on Steam or ProtonDB, but also in what ways it is or is not playable.",SteamDeck
jhjswg7,"I didn't have steam predeck. Didn't have a pc. And now I do, and I spend a lot on it. So yeah I guess it's changed. As have my bank statements",SteamDeck
jhjt4v2,Not particularly. I get the games I wanted to play like I did before and generally they're compatible with the Deck anyway.,SteamDeck
jhjthdi,">Has the deck changed your purchasing habits?

Not at all. The Steam deck is only a companion to my PCs.

>What do you think this means for the future of game publishers that don't make any effort to make a game playable on the deck?

Until the Deck becomes a huge player on the market, nothing. As far as I can tell, 3 million units have been sold so far. Over 60 million people use Steam on a daily basis.",SteamDeck
jhjwkek,It really doesn't change my purchasing. If there's a game I want I will buy it primarily to play on my high-end PC. If it works on my steam deck then that's awesome.,SteamDeck
jhjzeff,It will be when I get a job lmao,SteamDeck

jhk1okr,I‚Äôve bought some more expensive titles since getting the Deck but I‚Äôll only buy what‚Äôs verified or well known to work on the Deck. My Deck is actually the most powerful games PC I have now so it‚Äôs gotta work on Deck if I‚Äôm gonna buy.,SteamDeck
jhk27ma,"No, I hardly ever used to buy Steam games before and now I‚Ä¶. Oh, wait never mind üò≥",SteamDeck
jhk4jgj,"I play a lot of indie games and rogue lite games now.

I used to just play management games and the odd RTS on my laptop.",SteamDeck
jhk4phn,Absolutely. Anything I look at has to work on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhk51qb,"Yeah I wasn‚Äôt buying anything on Steam for like 5+ years now. After Steam Deck, I bought so many my Steam friends were like ‚ÄúEnjoying that new Steam deck?‚Äù Lol they could tell by the sudden uptick in games added that I bought a Deck. 

All my game recommendations are from threads about MUST BUYS on Deck lol",SteamDeck
jhk588m,"I had a laptop that was serviceable for gaming.  Never did much on it because it was over 6 years old before I got it.  As far as buying on or for Steam, that's definitely changed.  Over 300 buys or free claims since January.  Before that, I had 13.

As far as Verified ‚úÖ, Playable, or Unsupported...... I don't really let that be a decision maker.  I have The Last Of Us Pt. I and WWE 2K23 on Deck.  Both say Unsupported but both are, in my eyes, playable.",SteamDeck
jhk6xke,"I never really used steam before I got my deck, I bought fall guys and kindergarten with it but that‚Äôs all.

Then I got my deck and I think I‚Äôve spent the same amount of money I paid for my deck on games üíÄ",SteamDeck
jhk941m,I went from buying one game a year to 4 biweekly,SteamDeck
jhka9x2,Yeah i purchase lamer games that it can handle,SteamDeck
jhkaj31,"I was already primarily a Linux user, so I'd always go for games that had good reviews on [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com). I only recently got my Deck so I haven't really bought any new games yet (and also my library is stupidly huge and has tons of games I haven't tried yet).

I still primarily play on PC, and just have my Deck so I can play games while traveling. So I doubt my purchasing habits will change much, though that ""Steam Deck Verified"" stamp will probably sway me when I'm on the fence about buying a new game.",SteamDeck
jhkawoo,I stopped buying because the steam deck is allowing me to tackle my backlog! Which is a good thing,SteamDeck
jhke5w8,"Yes, Prior I would shop around various launchers for the best sale / price.

Now almost exclusively Steam",SteamDeck
jhke65j,Yes it made me spend more money,SteamDeck
jhke6bk,"Yes it has, I don't purchase on deck since my gift purchase was for my spouse but was sent to a friend instead so yeah not buying anything on the device again",SteamDeck
jhkemxa,Nope if I wanna play it I buy it. So far everything has worked outside of changing proton versions on niche situations. Proton 8.0 here now though so maybe that'll be less a problem.,SteamDeck
jhkeqvk,"Not really. I do like to check how the games I buy run on Deck, but I don't rule out a game if it doesn't work.

That said, I'm experimenting with daily driving Linux on my desktop PC, so general Linux compatibility will matter more to me as I get more comfortable with it.",SteamDeck

jhkfzd5,I have definitely purchased more games. Especially once they are on sale. And I can also say that the games are more fit for steam deck which in my case means I play for 20 to 40 minutes and then come back later or the next day where I left off.,SteamDeck
jhkgnqx,I buy less now,SteamDeck
jhkgun2,[Grogu says Yesss](https://tenor.com/YSQyopzOjP.gif),SteamDeck
jhkit0d,It‚Äôs lead me to the brink of divorce. My husband said that I can‚Äôt buy any more games for awhile,SteamDeck
jhkj8dr,The switch was my main gaming console so it definitely changed my buying habits! I haven‚Äôt bought any switch games since I got my steam deck in March. I‚Äôve bought a few games I always wanted to play but mostly I‚Äôve been getting games through fanatical and humble bundle deals. I‚Äôm also playing a lot more gamepass games so it feels like I‚Äôm getting my moneys worth.,SteamDeck
jhkjr2o,"In the last few years I only purchased games for playstation but not for steam. For steam I had older games, eg. Old strategy games, and I usually bought very cheap games. Since I have the steam deck, Ive looked for more.indie games and platformers as I use it for mainly that purpose",SteamDeck
jhkk5y6,Yeah most games I get repacked are now being purchased if they're enjoyable and run on the steam deck. I know windows is a thing but the user friendly-ness of the stream deck in general makes me just straight up buy them so I can play them in bed.,SteamDeck
jhkk6ot,"Totally changed it.  I hadn't bough a game on Steam in 18 months.  Since getting the deck, it is almost the only place I will buy a game.  And if it isn't playable on the deck, I am not interested.

As such, I no longer pre-order much because I want to make sure the game will be compatible on the deck.",SteamDeck
jhkm4d8,"Erm, just a little.

Like many others I had a steam account and a couple of free games in my library, none i had ever actually played. PC gaming, I just couldn't get into it 

Roll onto buying the deck and my library now stands at 179 games. Ok, some have been codes bought thru cheaper 3rd parties (humble, cdkeys, greenman), but valve have definitely recouped their loss leading hardware with my software purchases! Am I upset....far from it. It's reopened gaming up for me and brought new adventures together for my son and I playing together!",SteamDeck
jhkmaa0,"Nope. Still follow the ""isthereanydeals"" lowest price ever. I think I'm grow old n still use the website for alerts when prices hit all time low",SteamDeck
jhkmu9m,"Not really. Most of the games that aren't compatible are from companies I had already been boycotting for years, anyway.",SteamDeck
jhknlhm,"It's definitely shifted which platform I want to buy from. Like I'd pay more for a steam game than I would for the same game on GoG and I'm also more tempted to re-buy games I already have on other PC stores if they're cheap enough. (yes you can play GoG games on deck, but getting them straight from steam is often much easier)",SteamDeck
jhkor9q,"I've been buying old games & trying to make them work. Currently, I'm playing XII, which is ""unsupported,"" yet plays better than Far Cry.

It's perfect for nostalgia. That's been quite a change, b/c I used to mostly stick to new-ish games. (Stuff that's just old enough to be on sale.)",SteamDeck
jhkp0w3,"I mainly bought it as a backlog destroyer and it‚Äôs doing that quite well for me. I also moved any game that was on Switch and steam off my switch wishlist and onto my steam wishlist because I mostly play games portably and would have have them on steamdeck 

So for sure it‚Äôs shifted some sales to steam/pc. 

But I haven‚Äôt increased the amount of games I buy or the type really (although I wouldn‚Äôt have bought vampire survivors had I not seen it on here, that‚Äôs really the only one though)",SteamDeck
jhkpvtz,I find myself purchasing Steam games much more often after having a SD. The fact that you can play great games that are under $10 on the go is great.,SteamDeck
jhkq48v,"Just a bit. Got a few side scrollers on big sales, that's about it. Rest of my installed games are from existing library. I've cooled off from Steam shopping for a few months. Clearing out my backlog the best I can before D4 is out. Actually, D4 coming out soon made me shop less. Actually, I got my Deck mostly so I can play D4.",SteamDeck
jhkq9o5,Not at all. I almost exclusively use desktop mode. I just play what I want.,SteamDeck
jhks8xb,"Yes. It has encouraged me to purchase games that I otherwise would never have been able to play before owning a deck due to hardware limitations and affordability.

I've also purchased games/dlc for friends so we can play together, and the favors are reciprocated when they buy a game for me to play together with them! 

Definitely a bigger sense of community, which makes me want to continue purchasing titles to play together with friends.",SteamDeck
jhkt63l,Yeah buying a lot more older and indie titles now when before I used to just pirate them (allegedly) cause I don‚Äôt know how to remove viruses from Linux,SteamDeck
jhkttrf,I'm more likely to get a game on steam than playstation but that's about it,SteamDeck
jhktwdc,"Prior to my Deck, I owned Stardew Valley on Steam.

That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve always been a console gamer. 

Now I understand why my friends look forward to Steam sales with trepidation‚Ä¶",SteamDeck
jhktwzr,"Yeah for the worst üòû

My backlog is a eternal black hole.",SteamDeck
jhkuao0,i buy more games because of the steam deck but i also play more games because of the steam deck,SteamDeck
jhkuv4a,I actually buy games now.,SteamDeck
jhkwx99,"Definately looking at more cozy games, farming sim, tactics games, hell i even glanced at a visual novel game.",SteamDeck
jhkwzxk,I only buy games playable on the deck because nVidia's bullshit over the last 3 years led me to console gaming and never desktop PC again.,SteamDeck
jhkx0fz,"It has made me really get into rouge-lite or rouge-likes, never sure what they are actually called since more simple quick play games have peaked my gaming interests with the Steam deck. My current favorite is one called Undermine.",SteamDeck
jhkxj5s,The only thing changed is that I‚Äôve been buying tons of little indie games. I never really did that before.,SteamDeck
jhkxktn,"Not yet, I have a bunch of games that haven't played a ton that I'm finally playing on deck. But it will change how I play games, some games I'll want to save to play on deck (ie. Dredge) or only want to play it on my PC (ie. Jedi survivor when it comes out) Mostly for graphics and 60fps sensitivity",SteamDeck
jhkyrpi,"Yes. Before the deck I purchased a total of 0 things from steam. I am now at 120 games and I only thing I‚Äôm really playing at all is Genshin on my phone, so my priorities are not in the right place.",SteamDeck
jhkyubw,"Used Steam since its inception, but hardly used it over the years since I mostly played WoW/D3. Now I purchase games exclusively on Steam because of my Deck (even spending more). Epic isn't a great store, but they do have some great offers on from time to time.",SteamDeck
jhkz3ju,"I only buy playable and above, but then again I never use our laptop at home for hardly anything and I have an old Mac that bairly loads anymore. In fact, I'm not sure it even works anymore because I haven't used it in at least 5 years.",SteamDeck
jhkzlnt,"No,  I'm still an absolute mess with no ceiling on my gaming budget.",SteamDeck
jhkzypb,"Nope. Still have 848 titles with 11% played and a completion rate of 0.04% 

I buy games thinking I'll get around to playing them only to never launch any. 

I need help! ü•π",SteamDeck
jhl0hfp,Nah i still buy every game i see on sale lol,SteamDeck
jhl0inj,Steam Deck converted me from a pirate crew to the 'let's wait for this game to be 15 dollars in two years' crew.,SteamDeck
jhl1s26,"Absolutely. Instead of me spending $5 - $25 randomly on clash of clans and other mobile apps, I‚Äôm now spending it on random steam sale games that I‚Äôll install and play for 5 minutes then probably never play again. 

Thanks Steam ü´°",SteamDeck
jhl1y86,I usually wait for games I know I'll play for hours to go on the Switch so I can play it handheld but now I just buy it since I have the steam deck.,SteamDeck
jhl20k6,It'd caused me to purchase more things from steam.,SteamDeck
jhl263d,"I've bought a few games that I already own, free from other stores. Some I have played and love, but now want to play on the go. And others that I never did play, but see mobile as the perfect platform for them. It's also got me buying and playing more side scrollers, since on the PC I usually prefer to play a big AAA title. But I don't enjoy them as much on the deck, even if they run perfectly, so the side scrollers have been just right.",SteamDeck
jhl2bxi,Yes.  I sold all my consoles and use steam deck exclusively.,SteamDeck
jhl2equ,Went from owning legacy rocket league & 5-6 games (ran them of a surface pro 4) to now which incompasses 84 games.,SteamDeck
jhl2v43,"The biggest thing is that I will no longer get any game on any other launcher. I used to not really care that much, especially if it was an offline game. But now, there have already been several occasions where I paid more specifically to get a game on steam instead of Epic or Origin",SteamDeck
jhl3h9c,"YES. I got around one game every few months before getting the Steam deck, and one every two weeks or so after.",SteamDeck
jhl49lk,I definitely had a burst of purchases at the beginning. But it didn't last... there are only so many games that I even want to own.,SteamDeck
jhl62hb,"So many people saying they'd rather have a steam copy even if it costs more SMH.

I'd rather have a GOG copy than a steam copy... Though to an extent the steam deck has changed my mentality in that I do wish I had easier access to certain steam features (streaming & input mapping) for games I downloaded with heroic. I also wish heroic launcher had playability status sync since right now I have to manually cross check verified status.

But I'm wondering if the experience on windows will be better or worse than SteamOS. Like what specific advantages does SteamOS bring? I should probably make that a separate post though...",SteamDeck
jhl6t9v,"Yes, they tricked me into buying games when I usually wouldn't",SteamDeck
jhl7089,"I actually found myself purchasing more ""playable"" or even ""unsupported"" games then verified ones. Lately I've been playing a lot of Skul, which is classed as unsupported, but has absolutely zero issues",SteamDeck
jhl8gpq,"Oh absolutely. So many games I have purchased in the last 6 months, completely dictated by ""oh this would be good on the deck""",SteamDeck
jhl979i,"My purchases didn't increase until maybe a month later after owning the Deck. I thankfully had a small backlog of games I could play from the start that was supported. I did install some unsupported games like Star Trek Online. And now my purchases is maybe twice every other month. 

For those saying they've paid more on the steam storefront, I hear you loud and clear but there is a way around it.

https://www.greenmangaming.com/

https://www.fanatical.com/en/

These are where I buy my steam games and they're loads cheaper than going straight to the steam store.",SteamDeck
jhlbbym,"Not really, no. Quite frankly, I simply don't buy many games anymore unless it really is something that I've been looking forward to for a while. I did buy Diablo 2 Remastered on sale, but that's just cause it's on sale. BTW works fine on the deck, albeit a little small.",SteamDeck
jhldefv,"I have purchased more games since I bought the Deck than I have in the past 3 years. Indie games have really taken over my playing as well. 

I consistently check to see if a game is verified or I check ProtonDB. I‚Äôve been playing PC games for 15 years and I feel like I‚Äôve had an awakening in my gaming, especially because I have 3 kids and have a hard time finding time to play games. Now I can play in bed with no worries even if I‚Äôm a bit tired.",SteamDeck
jhlh7o1,I hadn't use steam in years since I stopped using my old tower so they definitely seen more from me,SteamDeck
jhlhcxo,"It did. I bought that drift car game, and I suck at it. I'm still trying to get why it is overwhelmed positive",SteamDeck
jhlmp0o,It changed mine as I only buy games that work on the steam deck now while I never worried about that specifically before.,SteamDeck
jhlo23d,Yes in one way now i always scroll down (on the mobile app which works more often than the store on SteamDeck) to check the steam deck compatibility even before I download free stuff,SteamDeck
jhlq0n1,"nothing about SD though, but ever since regional price keep going up, i rarely buy much these days

what's with using 40% of my montly salary just to buy a new AAA games?? fck that",SteamDeck
jhlsut3,"Steam Deck was my introduction to the PC ecosystem. I own two games on my Series X (Infinite, Yakuza 0), I now own 300+ games on Steam. PC games are cheap and bundles are literal crack 

I also only buy games for the Steam launcher - Gog and Epic don't have shader caches and cloud saves through Heroic.",SteamDeck
jhlsvlu,"Had a steam account for 15+ years and owned about 80 games. Mostly a console gamer. 
Bought a deck last fall and now at 400+ games, all through bundles and sales. 

Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever spent more than 25 bucks on a single game. 90 percent of purchases have been under 5 bucks. Insane value. Really makes you question the subscription model pushed by the corporate bohemoths. Yeah I know you don‚Äôt ‚Äúown‚Äù steam games but at least they don‚Äôt rotate out as quickly as games on gamepass or ps plus.

If Valve manage to boost the battery life and OLED the screen on the next go around, it‚Äôll be the perfect handheld system. I‚Äôm never gonna expect top of the line graphics performance from a handled, there are home consoles for that.",SteamDeck
jhlt6rs,"I'm now less likely too buy games and splurge on sales actually. The Steam Deck motivated me to get through the backlog of unplayed games from past sales.
Meanwhile, Humble Choice is accumulating a massive library to get through also.",SteamDeck
jhltzl2,I've found that it's changed my purchasing habits in that I buy some games specifically to play on the Steam Deck. I don't really play the same games on the Steam Deck that I do on PC.,SteamDeck
jhlvkn5,"Yes and no.

When I had a working PC, I would window shop often on Steam, and if a sale were to hit and I had the scratch, I'd take it.

The only change with Deck is I'm eyeballing on what is or isn't supported. For example, when I got the Deck, I updated my wishlist by adding the Halo MCC. When the Spring Sale dropped I noticed the ""Unsupported"" icon. Looked into it and come to find my deal breaker that the Anti-Cheat system MCC bared wouldn't recognize Proton almost guarantee ban from Multiplayer by absolute no reason. Luckily a recent patch hit MCC which now makes the Multiplayer playable on Deck.

The point however is I'm careful as to what games can actually be played on Deck with little to no issues. Although now that I think about it, I did much of the same with my old PC, finding out if games can or can't run so... huh perhaps nothing really changed after all.",SteamDeck
jhlvtk2,Definitely grabbing more indies than I was before that‚Äôs for sure.,SteamDeck
jhlvz43,"I generally make it a rule not to buy new games if my backlog is a certain size, and to always wait for sales. I‚Äôve saved money and played all of the games in my library with this approach. I‚Äôm really happy about it.",SteamDeck
jhlwkep,"Yes, enough said!",SteamDeck
jhm0j2j,"I am buying more action games. I don't have a great setup for a controlled on my pc, and keyboard/mouse doesn't work as well for a lot of these games.",SteamDeck
jhm0wqw,Yes. In the sense that I buy a crap load more games from steam now. Love my steam deck and love what it has done for gaming on Linux.,SteamDeck
jhm146o,Yes I was saving for a psvr 2 and I have wasn't 450 bucks on games in 4  months.,SteamDeck
jhm2pco,"I‚Äôve had a Steam account since beta, really only had it for CS and have probably bought 4 games in 20 years. I‚Äôve probably have purchased 20 games since getting my Deck 8 months ago",SteamDeck
jhm3w70,Nope. My tower is still my darling and focus of the entire operation that is my household for the most part. I absolutely love streaming heavy stuff to the deck though and if something low powered looks good I'll play it natively on the deck.,SteamDeck
jhm6stn,"Most definitely. Before I only played COD4 Modern Warfare on a 2011 MacBook for literally like 14 years. Since I got the deck I‚Äôve purchased and played Outer Wilds, Disco Elysium, Elden Ring, Hades, GTA V, among others. It has been ‚Äúgame changing.‚Äù",SteamDeck
jhm705g,"I don't do pc gaming so never owned any of the games. After having the deck, i did a massive purchase of games I always wanted to play. Now sitting at 8 games in just 3 weeks. Playing Elden Ring at the moment and loving it.",SteamDeck
jhm7au7,"I didn't buy a whole lot of games outside of the steam store to begin with, but the steam deck basically locked me into the steam store. It's great when it all works flawlessly, and that's something I've come to expect from valve. If it doesn't, all I gotta do is let uncle gaben know and he refunds me. I'm really impressed with valve/steam",SteamDeck
jhm85p7,Aloha has this happened when you purchased a game and you didn‚Äôt like it or didn‚Äôt work the game did you get a refund?,SteamDeck
jhm93ks,"Well, I have every single valve-released game in steam now, so there‚Äôs that",SteamDeck
jhm9e1i,"As someone who's not into sitting in front of a desktop to play a big game, buying the steam deck made me want to look into more AAA games, just by having the ability to play them in any position.

Of course, indie games aren't safe from my clutches either. Having my first handheld ignited my lost passion for metroidvania games. (Didn't like the switch so I didn't buy it)",SteamDeck
jhmarar,"Had my Steam Deck for about 3 weeks. Even though I have a XSX, Switch, and a PS5, I'm really thinking of getting most of my games in the future from Steam that are playable on the SD. I've found myself playing through more games from my back log, especially now that I don't have to sit in front of my PC/TV to play and so far I've had a pretty good experience. And knowing that I can simply play them in my PC to is great.

For Ex, was going to get No Man's Sky for the XSX but now I'm going to get it from Steam and play/level up on the SD and on my PC.

As long as the games run well I'll be playing them on the SD.",SteamDeck
jhmbdxc,"I bought things that I wouldn‚Äôt had considered buying otherwise, so yes.",SteamDeck
jhmeb7l,"Yep. Currently I basically go for console-friendly/like games. Games that play well without keyboard & mouse. Prior to the Deck, y went to more desktop-friendly games, as that was my main gaming platform.",SteamDeck
jhmfckn,Yes I‚Äôve spent way more,SteamDeck
jhmfu0g,Yes,SteamDeck

jhmp3av,"Sort of, I do try to ensure its steam deck compatible",SteamDeck
jhmpr49,"It absolutely has! I was always a sucker for AAA titles and that's all I played. Since buying the deck I've been getting into indie and metroidvania games. At the minute, I'm obsessed with Dead Cells, it reminds me a lot of the old Castlevania games I played as a kid on the GBA. I never would have been interested in something like that on the PC.

I'm playing a lot of old games on it too like the original Devil May Cry trilogy and Half-life.",SteamDeck
jhmsbmf,"No, but it has justified a lot of them.",SteamDeck
jhmtgt4,"I don‚Äôt really think it means anything for game publishers in the future, if a company is developing a FPS shooter their targeted crowd isn‚Äôt steamdeck",SteamDeck
jhmuf09,"I didn‚Äôt buy very many indie games on my PC mainly because a lot of those games don‚Äôt feel like something I would want to sit at a desk and play but since getting a SD, the majority of new purchases are smaller indie games",SteamDeck
jhmvimx,"Well it's certainly stopped me buying so many Switch games & has also stopped me double dipping on games.

I was absolutely going to wait for the next iteration of the Deck due to the tepid launch, but I gave in & got one from Valve a few weeks ago as I realised my dumb ass has spent close to the cost of a Steam Deck on buying the same games on both... that and - more importantly - Valve have finally got Deck OS etc in a good state (& made a few minor hardware upgrades) 

Switch is now all but purely for exclusives. And christ it really does have some belters for JRPGS & Nintendo absolutely smash everyone for their exclusives whixh you can play with everyone.

I have one major gripe with the Deck. Why the hell do we only have one USBc port!? I use headphones that need a Dac/Amp which of course connects via UBSc and there are of course other reasons for it.

I only play at home and yes, although now thanks to this sub there is a solution... there really shouldn't have needed to be one",SteamDeck
jhmvso9,I‚Äôve started looking to buy games that support Steam Cloud to enjoy the switch between my Deck and Desktop.,SteamDeck
jhmwfir,"Not really, I gave up on windows once they rolled-out 10 (linux sysadmin/user since 2002 but was gaming on 2000/xp/7 until then)

Although I tend to purchase more 16:9 and controller-friendly games for the deck now, I hate 16:9 on my UW desktop monitor (like ace combat 7)

Older games I also find more enjoyable on a 7"", also pixel art games look nicer, celeste on 3440x1440p is super blocky",SteamDeck
jhmwo9f,I buy less now because I'm actually playing finishing my backlog. Suspend puts me directly in the game. No opportunity to get distracted by the shop.,SteamDeck
jhmwocm,I would say so. Now I prefer to wait for the release of some games on Steam instead of buying them from the Epic store,SteamDeck
jhmwvya,Definitely not. Not buying only for SD,SteamDeck
jhmy4ci,"Absolutely not. I am a steam user and a gaming pc owner for pretty long, but I still have a huge backlog. I dont let the steam deck to dictate my purchasing habits, just bcuz sometimes im using the deck instead of my pc. Anyway, I got the deck with the intention to finally destroy my backlog and to play less graphics intensive, or older games and/or games that i wouldnt really play on my main rig. I am not particularly bothered if there are some games that dont run on the deck (there are pretty few to be fair), i can always play them on my pc.

 dont think the deck will have a big impact on the future of game publishers who doesnt support the deck, since the exclusive deck users are pretty marginal on the market. But i dont find it unimaginable that good sell numbers wont motivate them to optimize their games a bit better for this device.",SteamDeck
jhmz86r,"Yeah, if I see I game I believe would work well for me with deck controls on sale, I'm probably gonna get it",SteamDeck
jhmzrhz,"Well, as father of 3 kids, I thought, my gaming days were over since 2014.
Had no place for the gaming PC, no money for consoles and a Mac as work laptop.

So I bought the occasional Game that was playable on Mac (like my all-time favorite civ vi) and played some.

With the steamdeck I am now able to catch up on nearly all the games that I was not able to play in the last 10 years, all these AAA-Games.

But of course, I am playing civ vi on the deck right now ;-)",SteamDeck
jhn0aw2,yes,SteamDeck
jhn0ocb,"Before buying Deck in January I had only 4 games on my account. Now I have ‚âà60, all are paid

All are at least playable, but it's not the main factor, because all games I wanted were already optimized for Deck",SteamDeck
jhn1ce5,I am definitely buying way more games than i used to! These games are on steam only and if i have a game like need for speed heat on the ea app i will buy it again on steam simply to avoid needing to install and run these games from another launcher‚Ä¶. Yes i use other launchers like battle net but only because they are not on steam at all. Every game i buy since (buying)  the deck is verified prior on proton db and i don‚Äôt mind slight tuning but i try and keep my experience as simple as possible. I have also been gaming way way more than before! For me the deck is a game changer and although i was an intense pc gamer before i now never use my pc‚Äôs and only use the deck because of the sleep mode it has! I used to pirate a lot of games but now i pay them for the simplicity of downloading them thru steam and cloud saved. A big win for Gabe for sure!,SteamDeck
jhn3g3e,"Definitely. Before getting Switch and then Steam Deck I had never reached for the so called ""small games"" as well as 2d platformers or metroidvania type games. It's all changed now and I find those games pretty cozy on my Deck :)",SteamDeck

jhn5r54,I'm now broke....Does that answer your question?,SteamDeck
jhn5w0w,I have been buying even more games and I just buy any game I want and hope it works with the 12 different versions of proton I have. I have over 300 games and almost all work expect for games that need EAC üòä,SteamDeck
jhn9l0r,"Yes, and I don‚Äôt own a deck yet!

Planning to in the summer and I have found when purchasing I am favouring Steam, even if a game is cheaper on GOG or Epic

I won‚Äôt lie, I do worry that if the Deck becomes the default handheld PC, it may impact competition and I would love to see GOG and Epic look to support it, simply so that we consumers have more choice, but it‚Äôs up to them really in that regards I guess

I am also building up a catalogue of older/indie games, simply because, I missed out on them back when they first came out and I will get more chance to play them on Deck provided they are verified on PhotonDB

Like I didn‚Äôt have a PC that could run X-Wing at the time it came out way back when, but for a few quid I added that whole series to my PC and I am gonna have fun playing that on the Deck",SteamDeck
jhnazy1,"Yes.

Before Deck I used to buy only during sales, but I don't have strict preferences on my games, just look what is there and buy if looks interesting for me. Since Deck, I try to look things I really want to play (this is also because I already own a HUGE library), and I always check if it's playable on Deck, not only verified but if the experience will be satisfactory.

Sometimes I even look throught the ""Perfect for Steam Deck"" collection on Steam...",SteamDeck
jhnc9wu,"i've played some games here and there that arent considered compatible and i gotta say a lot of peoples complaints that might make a game seem unplayable are superficial and dumb. a lot of them run great regardless of controls. so most of the time i see no issue with the game as a whole. and if you do move it to be not compatible, people should make more of an effort to make it compatible and do more thorough testing for steam deck specifically. i'm playing red dead redemption 2 as i bought it on sale a few weeks ago and while i love the game and it is considered playable, it definitely is not perfect. i feel its even worse than if i played it on high end pc personally. it was def not tested enough and is super glitchy but i love the game regardless. its fun enough that even with the crashes, the glitches, the pop in, its still a good game. i'd love to try out pc exclusive game though but most dont catch my interest enough lol",SteamDeck
jhnev8h,Yes.,SteamDeck
jhnhr6k,"I rarely bought games unless it was a game I knew I wanted and was made aware of it outside of steam.

Now sometimes I turn on my deck and just browse the store wishlisting stuff to buy later.

Bought hades the other day haven't put it down since and I honestly don't think I'd ever would have if I didn't have the deck",SteamDeck
jhnmvyo,I'm buying more indie games/visual novels. I always liked them but it was uncomfortable for me to sit for an excessive amount of time next to my computer and just read/play turn-based gameplay but now I'm able to do it in my bed/on the way to work.,SteamDeck
jhnpaoh,Yep. Now I check to see if a game is compatible with Steam Deck.,SteamDeck
jhnptax,yes. i personally never bought games digitally until getting my Steam Deck,SteamDeck
jhnqd4j,"Yes I tend to buy ""verified "" games more often than not.",SteamDeck
jhnqf72,After getting steamdeck I started buying games and never play them.,SteamDeck
jho0ixu,Not really. Haven't bought too many games recently because money is tight.,SteamDeck
jho45wu,"Absolutely. Naturally whatever proton-db says dictates whether I'll buy a game or not. But I think my purchasing habits have changed drastically since getting a steam deck. I rarely look at grandiose single player campaigns. My lifestyle has become dependent on a very quick play and go, quick gameplay kind of preference. 

Instead of buying slow burners I buy fast paced rougelikes and other games that are not as time intensive as a story game.",SteamDeck
jhodr7b,"Nope. It hasn‚Äôt changed my Steam buying habits. I‚Äôve been using Steam since 2006, I might have bought more titles when I got the Deck in the fall, but wound playing my Ryzen 7 RTX 3060 build instead. If anything, the future of gaming has me concerned when titles like Gotham Knights become super grinding and paywalled.

I think publishers will keep developing PC games for Windows and Valve will be doing to work with Proton to get these games to run. Publishers don‚Äôt have much to do for development, Valve does ALL the work. It‚Äôs a checkmark at submission, then it‚Äôs flagged in Valve‚Äôs system to be reviewed and tested. If games were being developed natively for Linux, then it would be a much different story. Also, more Windows portables coming market (such as the ROG Ally), I don‚Äôt think anything will change for PC games as Windows first.",SteamDeck
jhom9ul,"Not really, outside of buying more indies in general. But yeah, I've found that everything I have (of 400 or so games) plays on Deck, though, admittedly, some play better than others. Surprised me that Metro: Exodus is playable.",SteamDeck

I have also shifted my dollars from buying physical releases for consoles to buying for the Steam Deck. When I decided to buy a SD, I decided to shift from bring a physical release collector to going back to being a gamer.

jhn48lu,"> I never used steam before getting a steam deck, so technically it did change my purchase habits on steam.

Haha, pretty much the same. If we count *free* games I think I had about 11 on Steam. But if we only count monetary purchases, there were maybe 4? Of course, I had a pretty old PC: it met the min req for the *original* Skyrim release but not Special Edition, if that gives a good indication of its specs. I mostly used it for Endless Sky and Scrap Mechanic's creative mode (survival mode was a bit too copy), and the rest of my gaming was on my PS4 (and earlier consoles; I like to collect).

Anyways, I got my 512GB Deck in September, and in the 7 months I've owned it, I've spent more than the system's price on games for it. It is my most powerful PC (and possibly my most powerful console as well, though I hear it only *slightly* wins out over the PS4).",SteamDeck

jhiv654,"It isn't necessarily a bad ranking system, the problem seems to be that it is a monumental task for them to take on and keep their ranking up to date. If a patch is introduced into a game, it can break something and cause a game that was previously fully functional turn into one that simply can't launch. So they would need testers to retest every game that updates. Since valve has a limited number of employees available to do this testing, it makes it easy to miss such an update or just be slow to respond to it. 

Since ProtonDB is open to all of us to report our findings on, they have a lot more people available to do the testing, and even find the fixes needed if it doesn't run. This speeds up the process and keeps things up to date much better, with more accurate info.",SteamDeck

jhjg11f,"I don't think it's a bad ranking system, I'd say that it's just overly cautious about any potential hiccups the game might have on steam deck. The way I see it, for something to be completely 'steam deck verified' it must play in a way that a console gamer would expect on a handheld gaming console. This means all the UI scales automatically to the size of the screen, that the default graphics settings perform very well, and that any prompt for text input, account sign-ins etc are as seamless as possible. If a game lacks just one of these aspects, then it's not 'verified'. It doesn't mean the game isn't playable! It just means that the experience will rely on the user getting past some tweaks to settings or some awkward text input.It's clear that Valve really wants to reach audiences that have never played games on PC before, and a great way to make the steam deck experience feel familiar is by advertising the games that are the closest to the console experience.

I know many avid console gamers that are not very techie people and having to remember how to manually invoke the on-screen keyboard, or tweak graphics settings is a legitimate challenge to them. This is not something they expect to encounter on mainstream gaming consoles, as all those games are delivered specifically for that system, and not just PCs in general.",SteamDeck

jhlpmo8,"> Komodo in comparison is selling it at the price Valve advertised, so I assume that Valve essentially paid Komodo to be their retailer in Japan instead.

Japan has all kinds of consumer protections and regulations, so it isn't the easiest to sell stuff in Japan without fully setting up a company in Japan to provide support and all the various paperwork required. So what ends up happening is you have local Japanese companies which contract with the manufacturers to be their local distributor and reseller taking care of all the local requirements, usually with a very healthy markup.

Very famously in Japan a company called ASK has an exclusive contract for import and distribution of graphics cards, leading to ridiculous pricing in Japan far above the cost of you just buying a graphics card overseas and shipping it to Japan yourself.

Don't go buying a VR headset to play with the Deck. It will not work. At least not in a way that someone would use to describe VR gaming.

VR gaming is much more computationally intensive than regular gaming. The PC has to do double the work because it has to render a separate image for each eye and it has to deliver that at at least 60 fps. For a Quest 2 better 90 fps. Even the Quest 1 needs at least 72 fps. And those frames have to be delivered without any microstutters. Otherwise you will get motion sickness.

The Deck sometimes can't even push 30 fps at 1280x800. Don't try to force it to do something it was never designed to do.

Valve is working on a new VR helmet that supposedly will have wireless capability (and potentially a slimmer version that doesn't? it's all still pretty hidden).

jhp41lj,"If you don‚Äôt mind emulating, SLAI is an old gem from the PS2 era. 

Steel Lancer Arena International is a mech arena game. You enter a battle arena of a city (around the world) and fight other mechs, earning money for takedowns. Crash enough mechs and the boss ‚ÄúRanker‚Äù for that rank and map will enter. Beat them and you‚Äôre the rank holder now.

It‚Äôs fun if you love to just cruise around an arena map killing enemies, and it has some pretty in depth systems for customization. 

I highly, highly recommend you use the Stock Market exploit if you play. The game can be a real terrible grind because of the low starting money. The game has 2 stocks, which raise or lower value on a set 100 day schedule. You buy A on one day, sell on another and buy B. Skip a few days, sell B, and it keeps going. You end up with like 10x the money. Makes the game a lot more enjoyable when you can actually afford to buy parts and tune them",SteamDeck

long story short

1. you probably wont get any kind of ""cease and desist"" (technically) if you're only downloading, you'd only get something like that for distributing content. You may, however get penalized by your ISP which could be anything from a slap on the wrist, to a permanent ban of service, up to legal issues if the copywrite holder wishes to press charges.
2. it depends on how you're downloading. if you're using peeer to peeer programs/protocols with out masking your network info then it is very likely you'll get a notice sooner or later. If you're downloading something just hosted at a website then it is highly unlikely you'd experience any issues from that as there is no way for the copywrite holder to know that you're downloading their stuff unless they setup or gained control of the website its self.",SteamDeck
jhm8dmg,"The worst you can get is a warning.

ISPs are mostly after ""big fish"" violators like the people who *host* websites that distribute ROMs and are in violation of *millions* of law breaks.

It's like going 1mph over the speed limit. Is it technically illegal to drive 61mph in a 60mph zone? Yes.

With MP2 on primehack you'll want to install the HD texture pack and probably remap some controls to make it easier to access visors/weapons. Otherwise it runs amazing and plays like a native console FPS.

Almost constant 60fps, too.

So Primehack isn‚Äôt for the Wii U version? Interesting you say you have to drop it in the Primehack folder. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. I would have just dropped it in the Wii folder! That‚Äôs a problem avoided, cheers. I have so many other questions!! lol

Erm. Cemu wise, to be honest I haven‚Äôt tried. Getting Cemu working on my Steam Deck was my focus of late. It‚Äôs definitely a troubleshooting option to consider! Thank you. 

If the Cemu version isn‚Äôt worth the effort, then I‚Äôll wait out the Wii download, texture and Primehack it. If the Wii U version should run but isn‚Äôt due to either a dodgy ROM or it just isn‚Äôt compatible, then I‚Äôd rather tweak that - if the controls are ‚Äòmodern‚Äô as such and comparable to the HD modded Wii version requiring Primehack. Does that make sense? Graphically are they the same do you know? 

Yeah, I‚Äôd prefer the most ‚Äòeye melting‚Äô graphics on Deck for the game I can achieve so that‚Äôs definitely important and I know the controls might need extra work to work but the controls aren‚Äôt my concern at this point unless they need to be.

Shardpunk: Verminfall - have only played this on the deck

jhjosxj,If you don't like to tweek don't get a deck.,SteamDeck
jhjr629,"I think part of the fun of the deck is customizing it and making it feel like it's running the way you want it.  Of course, if all you're doing is customizing it and never actually using it for a games, or anything else, then it might have been a potential waste of money.  

But a lot of people seem to buy the deck because they only have small bursts of time to play, so having a portable system usually helps them do that.",SteamDeck

jhmsm4h,Elder scrolls:Arena works great on the steam deck :) even though the games not technically mapped to play. For a game made in 1994 to play it now on a hand held device is actually pretty amazing. 7/10 experience without adjusting key bindings and messing with anything.

Though a common theme throughout is that the Ikea Effect definitely plays into my enjoyment of the game:

- Tyrian 2000 was the first game where I really invested the energy into learning how to craft a really good SD keybind
- Getting StarCraft playable without piracy, without making a battle.net account and without using the horrible Blizzard launcher took a long time but was _oh so worth it_
- Minecraft Legends I literally had to build my own Proton to get it to run! Mind you, I didn't write the patch, but I did learn how to set up podman, checkout a git branch with submodules and use the `patch` tool!",SteamDeck

You already should be able to do it in desktop mode with DisplayCAL (definitely calibration works although I haven't tested profiling).

Once I switched it to 12 bit color after getting a HDMI to displayport cable, my god what a difference it made.

Perhaps the deck is only outputting 8 bit color and that's why it looks fucked?

HDMI 2.0 bandwidth can only support 8 bit color at 60 FPS, HDMI 2.1 can only support 10 bit at 60 FPS. A displayport to HDMI cable can display 12 bit color at 60 FPS. Meaning an official dock from Valve +an HDMI to displayport cable should have the best results for color output. The valve dock has a displayport port, jsaux's dock only has HDMI. 

If you can even change the color but depth on Linux that is.

Otherwise, the only real option for HDR atm is dual booting windows. It would be solid to have the ability to change the color depth on Steam OS.",SteamDeck

jhlarfa,"One easy way to find out is getting a displayport to HDMI cable that supports 120FPS at 4k, so that it will support 12 bit color and installing windows, then enable HDR. If the issue is fixed, then yeah that's most likely the problem.

I have the JSAUX dock because I bought my deck before the official dock released, so unfortunately I can't test it for you.

The color bit depth makes such a crazy difference in output, video, videogame and color quality. It almost looks like a higher resolution.

I thought TV was straight up broken, but it turns out most of the issues I was having was the 8 bit color depth output. Most of my issues magically resolved by enabling 12 bit color. 10 bit is good too if you only do HDMI 2.1.",SteamDeck

Save folder locations are listed here: [https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hollow\_Knight#Save\_game\_data\_location](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hollow_Knight#Save_game_data_location)

If you're playing it through proton, it'll be in the game's pfx folder found in home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/367520. The folders from there on will follow Windows' file structure so use PCGW's reference to the Windows version's save folder.

Make a backup of the files in there just in case (!). Then, delete the corrupted save file (the one ending in .dat), and remove the .bak file name extension from the most recent backup files that end in .bak so that it matches the file name of the now deleted corrupted save (e.g. user1.dat). Try launching again. If it still doesn't work, go back to an older backup and try again.

It may set you back to the last time you saved the game, but at least you can continue playing.

Steam may prompt you that your local save is older and ask which version of the save you'd like to use, the local one or the Cloud version, in which case you should pick the newly recovered local one.

Frustratingly, it may also auto-replace your recovered save with the one in Cloud. The easiest way to avoid this from happening is to do all the file changes while the game is running and when you're done close the game, so that Steam Cloud synchronizes the fixed file. This is most easily done by making HK run windowed and then leaving it in the background while you're recovering your files.

Had to do this myself a while ago, and it worked out for me. Hope it does for you too!",SteamDeck

jhgzo28,Gotcha thanks I will look into that I just gotta look up how to do that. I was just wondering if I can use the left pad as an d pad,SteamDeck
jhltozh,"I love the fact that we have access to both of them and tbh I wouldn't change a thing on the deck. I find the trackpads incredibly useful! It was a feature I was really looking forward to using for shooter games especially but I just can't get on with them for that genre of gaming, not sure why lol Rts games they're great! Navigating the OS and browsers are fantastic but I've tried a bunch of times to use them in shooters and have failed haha I want to use them while gaming so badly because I'm terrible at aiming on sticks üòÇ

To answer your question though: They're already in the best place they can be really. The only other way around (Imo) would be to flip the trackpads and joystick positions so the trackpads are on top and joysticks on the bottom. But like I said, they're already in the best place really, it's just a personal issue I think.

I have been thinking about switching the control scheme around for a while now with shooters. E.g R5=R2, L5=L2, R4=R1, L4=L1 and giving it a try that way with the trackpads so that my right index finger is on R4 and right middle finger is on R5 with the left hand following the same grip.",SteamDeck
jhh0zgk,"By default it should act as a D-pad. I always felt it was a little too easy to press the wrong direction on it, but that doesn't mean you'll have the same experience.

To enable the back buttons, hit the steam button while you're in the game. Push right on the D-pad once the menu is up and you should see a ""configure controls"" or something similar button. From there you can enable and map them.",SteamDeck
jhid6gb,"Just wait until you dive into the options available in the controller customization settings. It's amazing, and one of the best features of the device that nobody really talks about.

Steam input is a godsend, truly.",SteamDeck
jhj3sg8,"For real. Steam Deck is not only my favorite gaming device, but also my favorite controller now. Whenever I'm playing on the TV with a DS5 controller I play worse because of the missing buttons. Obviously you can customize DS5 via Steam input as well, but there's just less to work with.

Usually on portable platforms there is a level of sacrifice with controller ergonomics, but with the Deck it feels like the reverse when switching to a traditional controller.

I've logged over 90 hours on Fallout 4 in the past couple weeks. The game is marked as best played with mouse and keyboard but the Deck handles it with no problem.",SteamDeck

I like that valve support the official one very well for the best compatibility. in addition you get a second power brig with it that makes the price much more reasonably.

FWIW, Windows is no better unless you have software you have to use that doesn't work natively in Linux or through WINE (basically I mean: The Adobe Suite).

Anyway, if you're looking at the Deck as a gaming console first that can do PC stuff in a pinch, the Steam Deck will absolutely leave you satisfied.

jhlkmcw,"Hey, thanks for using CU!

Both patches 1.08 and 1.09 have affected performance for the worse on the Deck, at least based on a small amount of testing I‚Äôve done. 
I tested with CU off and on and performance is still about 4-8% higher with CU, but worse than when I originally tested it in my Deck Dive. 

I‚Äôm hopeful that SteamOS 3.5‚Äôs L3 cache improvements and some proton updates will help, but for now I think we‚Äôll just need to lower settings a bit (at least until I get another chance to look at it thoroughly).

jhmi2yk,"You need 240Hz. Minimum. Thats a joke.

FSR is resolution agnostic. It works with every resolution target you throw at it.

Which FSR do you mean? Steamdecks internal FSR. Or the games internal FSR?

Because Steam Decks internal FSR afair scales everything to the output resolution the Steam Deck itself is set to in display options. With the source resolution as a base. (Looks worse if target display resolution is higher. But only as a rough rule of thumb, actually display diameter plays more into it than output resolution, if FSR upscales from the same base resolution.) Steam Decks internal FSR (FSR version 1 based) is available for every game.

A games internal (as in built in) FSR scales everything to the resolution the game is set to in game. With the FSR quality level picked dictating the source resolution. (Runs slower (less frames) if taget output resolution/FSR quality level is higher) Built in FSR in a game is not available in every game.

Output resolution on the Steam Deck is also limited by ""a container per game"" which can be set in the games shortcut settings in game mode, and thats the ""max"" resolution the game is told the monitor can handle - which on default (setting afair is even called default) is always either 720p or 800p (thats auto switched between those two depending on aspect ratio), which is not at all the max of what your monitor can handle - but what Valve decided is best for the end user, to not run into ME GAME RUNS LIKE CRAP ON ME 8K MONITOR (or 1080p for that matter) postings.

And as a result you have all kinds of postings out there of people saying, that their games look like crap on big monitor, because steam deck games  always output at 720p! Which is wrong (they dont if you change that container setting, and then the in games resolution option) - but why should we correct them really... What we did trying to support a learning community gets swiped away by 60 support me longtime postings each day.

For your purposes: 1080p monitor better.",SteamDeck
jhmigbh,"Any time the render resolution is less than the output resolution (i.e. the native resolution of the display), FSR can be used. 1080p or 1440p output doesn't matter. All that matters is what the game is rendering is less than that.

That said, the larger the gulf between the render resolution and output resolution the worse the upscaling will be. For example, rendering at 800p and outputting at 1080p will give better results than outputting at 1440p, as there's less pixels to invent. However, rending at native or as high as possible is always going to be best. The goal of upscaling is to get close to native quality while saving the performance cost of actually rendering at native. Therefore, it's a balancing act.",SteamDeck

jhmlsh8,"Signal path is this: FSR 1.0 based upscaling is very light on resources, as in ""costing  a frame or so"" compared to bilinear upscaling. Target resolution almost doesnt matter, as long as the source resolution stays the same. CPU cost will always be ""arround one frame"" (let it be 2 if it scales to 1440p and that would be an unexpected 100% performance cost increase) when compared to bilinear upscaling. Also just as a rough outline, because frames in different games are not equally costly to render, obviously.

So here is the sequence of things. Lets say a game supports FSR2:

FSR 2 set in game options > looks at quality level also set in game options sets input (games render resolution) resolution based on that and the games target output resolution > games target output resolution will almost always be set to 720p or 800p.

In that instance with FSR 2.0 set to balanced it will set render resolution to 72% (from memory) of the games target resolution. To a higher percentage resolution if you set it to quality. FSR 2.0 very costly compared to FSR 1.0. But also mostly dependent on the games target resolution, as it will set render resolution based on a percentage of that.

Games target resolution is set to 720p/800p because of the games container settings, that can be changed in the games shortcut options in gaming mode, and  presuming, that the game autopicks the highest available resolution. Which it is told is 720p/800p. You can change that in the games shortcut settings. (Away from default.) And then would also have to change it in game settings. (Container settings are just the maximum the game is told (lied to) the display is capable of.)

Valve tries to not show that to the user too much, because once you start to set games output resolutions to a TVs resolution by auto, auto picking everything, like every honcho would like to do it - the steam decks GPU cant handle that on most games. Its designed for 800p@40Hz output on most modern games. So if you connect it to a 1080p@60Hz TV and let it dictate what the game renders, screaming by people increases. But you can bring your steamdeck to actually render a game in 1080p@60hz or even 8k@60Hz natively - if the game is very ""light"" - or if you enjoy playing on 1 frame per second.

So lets say you stuck to 800p.

FSR 2.0 built into game and enabled, balanced preset picked, game autopicked 800p because it was told by the ""container"" thats the highest resolution the monitor supports (it isnt - but the container tells it any value you like, and by default it tells it either 720p or 800p based on detected aspect ratio).

Game looks at 800p output resolution and at FSR 2.0 balanced settings, takes 72% of that, sets games render resolution to 576p and outputs 800p FSR 2.0 scaled.

At that point the decks built in FSR can kick in - always looks at the games output resolution which in this case would be 800p and FSR 1.0 scales it to whatever target display resolution is set or autopicked in the steamdecks display settings, when an external display is connected.

Steamdecks FSR 1.0 could also kick in if you set the games base resolution to 576 or 640 or anything in the games resolution settings and didnt enable the games built in FSR at all. It doesnt care, it doesnt even care if the game supports FSR. It takes the games output resolution (576, 640, or 800 or anything really) and scales it to whatever resolution is set (or auto set) in the steamdecks display settings for the connected display. And all that it takes for doing that is 1 frame of games performance, maybe. (Just as a rough outline.)

Hz are interesting as well.

So for many games Steamdeck operates best at 40Hz, but not many displays support that as an input. Some do.

So when you connect an external display Steamdeck creates a second config (as in connected to a TV or monitor config) per game that always defaults to 60Hz again, like your steamdeck does out of the box. You can then force it to 40Hz f.e. (by enabling a special setting acknowledging that you know what you are doing) in the battery menu again - but if your external screen stays dark after that you know it doesnt support 40Hz. :)

Using 40Hz instead of 60Hz if the game is only able to provide a locked 40fps f.e. using the graphics settings you chose, might improve frame pacing. Meaning not every 3rd frame or so gets doubled (cost free, but judders). Thats why you'd potentially pick it over 60Hz at all.",SteamDeck

So if you show understanding, and indicate that this really is just a last ditch effort after you've tried many things yourself - its totally fine, but then we still need to differenciate, if you even used protondb before to find information on it.

Workaround you can do for that is creating a folder for each sd card on steam and put game into that. Then every time you download a game in a specific sd card you will have a group for that sd card.

I quick close of program and reload fixed without tweaks.  I have heard that you can get better performance with adjustments... but I'm not a serious gamer.

The only 3rd party utilities I use are ProtonUp-Qt, Heroic, and ""Bonk(?)"" for SteamGridDB. I use sshfs and Barrier to connect the deck to my PC for the occasional file transfer, and to use a M+KB.

jhgv1ht,"My buddy is like you. I try to motivate him to using the desktop mode so he can learn some new things but he‚Äôs scared to mess with Linux. I recommend taking it little by little. If you know how to operate windows then Linux will be ver similar but if you don‚Äôt then here‚Äôs what I recommend learning/doing  first. 

1. Just learn how to search for stuff on the web browser by pressing the select button (idk what it‚Äôs called) + x it allows you to use the keyboard and by pressing those combinations again it will close it.

2. To download some apps, you can use the discover store to search for apps and download them. Like google, emulators, and ect. Just take the time to click and search and after a while, you will get better at it.

3 after getting used to that, I recommend downloading a program called wine. It even looks like this emoji üç∑. What this program does is allow Linux to run window programs. (Not all of them work but a good majority of them do). This will be the experimenting part that you will start to get better at. Even natives still have to tinker with programs sometimes just to see how they can get things to work.

4. Learning how to open folders and get to your destination. Take it little by little and you‚Äôll soon get better at it. Heck even I‚Äôm still learning where some places are.


And from there you will slowly grow your knowledge. Reddit is a great place to ask questions and get answers I am by no means a native to linux because I only started using it since I bought my deck but I can tell you now, I know how to navigate the software pretty good but it came with trial and error.",SteamDeck

jheiwin,"CryoUtilities and set Vram to 4GB. Thats the minimum anyone should do to be able to play many games that stutter/micro freeze. Using the latest proton build also helps.

jhej0zo,"I did set up EmuDeck but after that was configured I've been strictly using it for gaming, both Steam and non-Steam.

That said, I've thought about getting a second one to use as a really portable development device lol. My laptop is fine, and honestly the second SD would probably just end up being used for co-op games lol.",SteamDeck

I never imagined as a kid I'd be playing all the games I love and have grown up with on the go, and I also never thought when I played Elden Ring for the first time I could play it at work on my lunch break lol.

But I have always been aware that mentality locks me out of lots of stuff, which Deck ownership has largely let me access in a form factor I enjoy. 

With Deck I can be a puny console gamer as I so enjoy being, but also with added potential for mods and so on.

I have, of course, invariably fallen down the tinkering rabbit hole with the Deck anyway though, almost as if they planned it all along...",SteamDeck

Downloading all the recommended decky plugins. It‚Äôs a lot of fun and I‚Äôve been really surprised how much extra power you can get out of this thing. God I can‚Äôt say it enough. I love my steam deck so much. Pretty much became my exclusive gaming system and has given me a gaming life back after getting old and having kids and working startups that required a lot of hours.

I have mainly been playing Elden Ring, Days Gone, and RDR2.  So far I have not experienced any need to drive me to tinker with Cryo or Plugins.  

Also, the consistent updates from Steam make me reluctant to invest too much time into tweaking as it seems Steam is very focused on unleashing more potential from the Deck that I would not want my time in tinkering to be erased with future updates.",SteamDeck

I tweak settings a little for every game to get a good balance of performance and battery life. I care a lot about battery life and the out of box experience usually has room for improvement in that regard.

I might install some emulators, but haven't yet, so much else to play. Haven't installed any non-Steam games yet either, though there are a handful I might try some day.

Oh, and I modded a few games here and there, pretty minor stuff and mostly copied over from my laptop I used to use for gaming.

Haven't been successful at playing switch gsmes on it yet, but I've got a switch so I'm not too worried.",SteamDeck
jhf2rqe,Yeah this was me. Just downloaded a few games and settled on playing Dinkum. I recently downloaded crypto utilities (think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called) because it was so easy to install and set up but I can‚Äôt tell a difference in dinkum.,SteamDeck

jhf7j0l,Yup,SteamDeck
jhf7me1,"Same. The whole reason I bought a Steam Deck in the first place was because I have no experience tinkering with PC stuff, I‚Äôve only ever played on consoles.

jhf7un9,"Honestly emulation was one of the biggest draws to getting a Steam Deck, most of the stuff you don't need to tinker with I could get on PS5 or Switch. 

I'd say my game time on Deck is 50/50 between my Steam Library and emulation. I probably wouldn't have paid out the cost of a Deck purely for the exclusive stuff that is directly on Steam and not available elsewhere.

That said, now I have it, I find I buy games on Steam rather than Switch now because Steam will be more forwards compatible.",SteamDeck
jhf7w2m,"The most 'tinkering' I do is using the deck as a normal PC in desktop mode when docked half the time.  And also using desktop mode to set up some non-steam games to work in gaming mode (FFXIV, Minecraft).  I do have decky installed, but it was just for stuff like setting artwork using SteamGridDB and updating flatpacks from gaming mode, lol.",SteamDeck

jhf8ip9,"I just play my bog standard steam library games, if I start tinkering I‚Äôm gonna break something!",SteamDeck
jhf8j4f,I haven't yet but part of it is because I never really gamed on a PC with the exception of D2 Load. I am not familiar with modding and such and a little scared since I am not a techie guy. But I do want to do some so I can play games like Diablo on this,SteamDeck

jhf9gt4,"Not much tinkering going on here, though I would like to add an external fan if I can find a decent one",SteamDeck
jhf9oao,I'd assume 80 percent of the people who own it may have only at the most used decky or done nothing to their deck and play it as is. Things you see on Reddit make up a very very small percentage of the user base same with YouTube and other social outlits,SteamDeck
jhf9obg,"I tinker... why? Simply because I can. If there's a setting to change, it will be changed at some point 

90% of my games will run fine first try, but if I can eek out a little more performance or efficiency you can bet I'll find out how to. As for that other 10%, I just want to make it run, even if I'll never actually play it beyond seeing my work be successful 

Will I appreciate that slightly more pretty scene? No. Will those 12 extra frames help me? No. How about the extra 30 minutes afforded by limiting wattage and clock speeds? Maybe it's useful twice a year",SteamDeck
jhf9q4q,Depends on what tinkering means? Haven't used Decky loader but use CryoByte utilities.,SteamDeck
jhf9vcf,"I should install the new fan because the wheeze is super distracting. But I don't really want too. 

Same for dual booting windows,I'd rather not, me and Linux aren't friends even if I wanted too so I'll probably ruin it.",SteamDeck
jhfa1lr,"For me, sometimes the process of making something work is more fun than actually playing the game.

I got KH2 randomizer working on the deck, which took bottles, navigating programs with no UI, installing things with scripts, and eventually adding it all to steam and making it work, and I've sunk less than an hour into the game after all that work.

I just enjoy the process of getting something to work, moving on, then playing it later if I finally want to. Most of the games I actually end up playing through on deck are ones that require no initial setup and just worked properly from the start, but I really enjoy tinkering and messing with stuff to get it just how I want to.",SteamDeck
jhfa42l,Setting it up to seamlessly play stuff from my free Epic library is about the only thing I‚Äôve done beyond stock. Also using cryoutilities to reduce crashing,SteamDeck
jhfa56k,"While I intend to tweak and mod later, for now I'm content with cursing at EA's launcher until Mass Effect legendary edition loads lol. About the only real tweak I've done was set the Gamescope stats to occupy the top black bar when i set games to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. It's only 80px tall but that's a total of 102,400 pixels the Deck doesn't have to worry about lol.

Or to really blow your minds... 2.66x the pixels displayed by the Gameboy Advance! That all fits in the tiny 40px wide strip at top and bottom lol

The other tweak is switched to Old fan curve when I'm outside, and new fan curve inside (or just when it's cool weather)",SteamDeck

jhfh79p,"First of all - I guess I envy you. If you're happy with it the way it is, that's honestly great.

What I've personally done: 1. I've installed Fantastic - a plugin that allows you to have more fan control. Honestly, this one is the only mandatory one for me. I played a lot of undemanding games, which with the default SD settings means that the fans don't have to run at all, until the components heat up enough, then they kick in into quite fast RPM, then they turn off completely again. This was really distracting to me.

2. Vibrantdeck plugin - simply just better screen saturation.

3. PowerTools plugin - i wanted more charging control, e.g. being able to force charging off when wanting to play plugged in with a partially depleted battery to conserve battery health. Honestly, in my experience, the battery control has a mind of it's own most of the time, so I couldn't even really recommend it at this time. Maybe it's actually not even worth it fussing about with this, but who knows how the battery will hold up with in time?",SteamDeck

Did the same with my switch, my model can handle cfw out of the box, so I've set that up. Now I can play it with whatever controller I want, backup saves, install my games to the device instead of switching cards, ... And I'm sure it's why I played it quite a bit because of it. Of course, my Steam Deck replaced it entirely (that is, until the new Zelda game is out).

You absolutely don't have to tinker. I can advise cryoutilities to get better performance, but if you like it, then don't.

Plus I‚Äôm a huge fan of Mecha and Anime games, so they either don‚Äôt work cuz of EAC or just meh cuz they aren‚Äôt fully supported.

It was pure luck that DNF Duel ironically ran better on the SD vs PC since the screen tearing issue didn‚Äôt exist on the SD. Then luckily Capcom didn‚Äôt put EAC on Battle Network Legacy Collection so I can play that online with no problem. 

I had to do A LOT of digging to find Linux EAC just to run Gundam Evolution on it. Granted I can‚Äôt play online but I can at least do everything else on it.

Then again if I wanted to fix those issues I would have to at least put Windows on it at the cost of other issues.

Like if you can do everything you wanted to on your SD just fine then I wouldn‚Äôt bother tinkering with it. I bought mine as an excuse since my laptop can‚Äôt run Linux and I didn‚Äôt have my desktop yet so tinkering was the first thing I was going to do.",SteamDeck

If I were to recommend one almost-zero-effort, lots of bang for your buck software mod, even if you did nothing else, it would be downloading the Decky Loader/Vibrant Deck combo.

Only thing i would do is if anything broke to just go to the ifixit website and order replacement parts( hopefully that's a long way down the road). It really does work good right outta the box.

Valve has done enough to build up the platform to satisfy people like me who just want games to work out of the box. When I saw the SD Verified program, that was the final factor that convinced me to get the Steam Deck.

jhfwlsm,"I started that way, but yeah.. I've now got a thermal pad on the CPU and that JSAUX backplate, that combined, drop my temps a few degrees, while also making the fan quieter. I can get most AAA games to run at 35FPS max settings and indie titles (and even DOOM) at 70FPS. That extra 5-10 FPS (~15% performance increase) with less noise just looks and feels a bit nicer than stock. I hear that extra fan attachment JSAUX sells ACTUALLY does something for temps, but that's crossing the line for me. XD If I have to bring something else with me, I don't want it. 

But yeah, CryoUtilities 2.0 (with RAM at 4GB in BIOS) and Power Tools, that unlocks SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading?) are a must. Having the saturation up a bit is also nice with the Vibrant Deck (?) plug-in, and then having the HLTB (How Long To Beat) as well as the random game selector plug-ins also just make it easier to get to and through games when I can't pick. Hope that helps!

jhghsh9,The most I done was install emudeck but everything and install heroic games to be able to play GOG and epic games.,SteamDeck
jhgi2nt,I run it as is. Only mods I've done were the ssd and the gulikit sticks and the sticks were a why not thing since it was relatively cheap and easy compared to putting Xbox elite 2 sticks in a dualshock 4. I already struggle to have time to game in the first place.,SteamDeck
jhgi8h3,"Mine just sits and collects dust. I wanted to like it so much, but something doesn't resonate with me. Maybe it's the size of the device, or SteamOS, not sure. I have an Odin Lite on the way though, so I may end up selling it off.",SteamDeck

jhgljmm,"I enjoy that I can tinker on the device, even if that‚Äôs just setting up emulation for a bunch of stuff in case I want to use it later, but also actually use it as a primary gaming device. 
But as someone in tech it‚Äôs fun that I can use the device for both things. It‚Äôs a computer so I use it like I would a gaming PC. It‚Äôs nice when it works out of the box and it‚Äôs nice when you can get something going that you‚Äôre interested in that isn‚Äôt available elsewhere.

I have not opened up mine since Valve spooked me into not upgrading my 2230 drive while under their warranty.

If you don't want to tinker with it... then don't do it. Tinkering has a very broad term on the Steam Deck too, you have to play with all the onboard options to get the performance you want out of EVERY game.

I just wanted to play some old ps1/2 games. I grew up on console and never had the chance to emulate so it‚Äôs all just foreign to me. Took me weeks to finally get SSBU on my deck and after I did I had to settle for playing it on my switch because I couldn‚Äôt crack how to get the DLC to work.

I was really tempted to install Decky Loader so I can update flatpaks with it, I was still okay with adding the discover store and update from there.

Although honestly I didn't really do much tinkering until I got pissed at the audio stuttering after sleep problem, and I read that I can install a plug-in to pause games before sleep, that was basically all I've done to it.

I was told windows would drain performance but I have tested a variety of things, especially MW2, and I am able to run that game at settings higher than I expected and get more than 60FPS consistently.

jhfvqp1,">Very basic question, but I feel like I'm doing my tinkering wrong. Are you all just switching to desktop mode and navigating using the gamepad and trackpads? 

For all the tinkering, you basically need to do it in desktop mode. Everything you could want is either from the discover store and requires configuration after installation, or you are downloading something from a website like emudeck.com or something else which requires konsole.",SteamDeck
jheq6bt,"Depends. If you can do it in gaming mode it usually works better in gaming mode since that is what the deck is designed for. But you specifically need the desktop version to do certain things like downloading non steam games into the deck or going into the filepaths. Basically if you could do it on the PC without ever opening up a non steam program then there's no reason to leave game mode, if you need to open non steam programs to do something (including any kind of file explorer) then (edit: ~~gaming~~ desktop mode) is the way you want to go.

Personally I think desktop mode without peripherals is fine, totally serviceable, if you just need to pop over to desktop to do some quick tinkering.",SteamDeck
jhgh8mq,"I have done a ton of tinkering with my deck. The only real time i HAD to have a keyboard is when i used a usb drive with smokeless ui to access hidden parts of the steam decks bios to do an undervolt before trips and an overclock when I dont need long battery life. This takes me about 30 seconds to do now that i know my decks limits. Fun thing is on undervolt in re4 remake capped at 30fps i get an extra 20 to 30 minutes of battery compared to stock. On overclock my deck went from 40fps in cyberpunk to a near locked 60 too...granted battery doesnt last more than roughly 50 minutes buuuut lol.

Regardless, those are the only two things i needed a keyboard for. Anything else is 100% serviceable with the stock deck controls.",SteamDeck

Beyond that, I can't quite figure out how people end up troubleshooting issues with any of them or really optimizing the configuration of emulators in gaming mode. I mean, I understand mechanically how to navigate in desktop, but the why of selecting individual options in Linux is a little mysterious.",SteamDeck

jhlvshu,"It really depends on your taste. I‚Äôve found a ton of use for my deck that I never expected, and went the opposite way, recently selling my gaming Pc.

I find a lot of joy in the easy to play games, that I can pick up to play for short periods, but don‚Äôt completely forget how yo play if I don‚Äôt play for a month or so. Some recent examples are Dredge (awesome RPG like game), no man‚Äôs sky (though this one can be hard to pick back up after a long period), cities skyline, bravely default 2, Skyrim, and Forza Horizon 5.

On the completely unexpected side of thing(some of which require desktop mode), I do most of my 3D print modeling, 3D print slicing, and fine desktop games. One thing I‚Äôve found especially pleasing, is leveraging the decks ability to play a game both in desktop and handheld mode. For instance, cities skylines plays well in hand held, but very few mods are usable due to their reliance on keyboard shortcuts and commands. So I‚Äôll often ‚Äúrough in‚Äù a city expansion while on the couch, then dock later and fine tune everything with mods later using keyboard and mouse. I know this isn‚Äôt directly what you asked for, but just some ideas of how to breath some life into the deck.

If you have a solid desktop, it‚Äôs hard not to play it. My gaming pc was having some issues with the mobo, so I was in the unique position of spending $500 updating mobo, processor, etc or buying a deck for the same. I rolled the dice on the deck and have been super happy (enough to part out and sell the working pieces of my desktop).

Hopefully some of my couch game suggestions above help you out. Good luck!",SteamDeck

I actually prefer using the ""mouse,"" because the trackpad is a lot easier for my tiny baby hands to reach than the c-sticks. It just moves and feels so intuitive that my thumb naturally gravitates there anyway.

Not just for use in the menus, either. I use the trackpad to move the camera around. It took about a minute of getting used to, but once I did, oh my God, controlling the camera with the trackpad is just so much more responsive. The c-stick just moves it way slower and in clunkier movements for me. It feels awful.

I used to use a GPD Win with NorthernUI controller support for Oblivion. It worked, but still felt so clunky to me. Not so with the trackpad on the Deck--plays smooth as silk.

Oblivion isn't the only game I enjoy the trackpad/mouse with, either. Probably the best thing about the Deck's built-in controller imo, which really sets it apart from the Switch and other handheld competitors.

Mine was set to 'Folders, tabs, and window state from last time' by default. If yours is showing the same then maybe choose the second option & choose a specific folder.",SteamDeck
jhib57l,"So you recommend to let it be?   
I found out that from System settings > Removable storage > Removable devices and then i unchecked all the boxes under On Login and On Attach. Then apply. Now it no longer prompt me when i switch desktop mode.

jhi8yya,"Honestly, i do not know what i'm doing. Haha. I'm just trying to find out what causing the authentication is required prompt every time i enter desktop mode.

My first linux device.",SteamDeck
jhm6s8z,"Hey! I think it works!! I did exactly what you said:

Enter dolphin > click on the 3 lines top right > configure > configure dolphin > under startup tab > select the second option on ‚Äúshow on startup‚Äù and I chose the folder ‚Äú/home/deck/Desktop‚Äù.

Also found out that if I chose the folder ‚Äú/home/deck‚Äù by default, it still prompt me the message after switching to desktop mode. Which is strange. 

I‚Äôll try to do more testing to see if it stills pops up. 

Thank you everyone for trying to help me! This is what Reddit community should be! You guys are awesome!",SteamDeck
jhil8wk,"MicroSDs and USBs (storage ones, not things like KB&M) almost certainly will stop auto-mounting after doing that, so you'll want to put it back if you use either for game storage.

If you cancel that dialog and then navigate somewhere else, like documents, it should stop happening.  
Dolphin (file manager) remembers every folder you had open and you were trying to open /var/efi which requires root privileges (same password as your account, it's similar to Windows asking for permission with UAC).  
/var/efi is, if I'm not mistaken, boot information.

It‚Äôs not as simple as just installing Windows, there are some other steps you have to take to get everything working like controllers and WiFi on Windows. Not a seamless setup, but once it‚Äôs setup it works great.

The Deck is as powerful as a midrange laptop, but the screen is low resolution (720p) so you can run pretty much every game. Newer demanding titles will run around 30fps at 720p. eSports are 60fps all day. Warzone runs around 40-50fps on low for reference.

Emulation performance is very good. GameCube and older all run really well. Every GameCube game I‚Äôve tried has been flawless. 

Switch is hit or miss. Prime Remastered, Metroid Dread, Pok√©mon Diamond have been rock solid for me, but I‚Äôve heard other games struggle. A lot of the switch performance issue are due to the fact that the emulators are not mature yet. So it‚Äôs getting better all the time.

jhd9szt,"Soulstone LOOKS better but in its current state fizzles out after a few hrs because there is no endgame.

jherwdq,I am 46 and definitely agree that time does feel like it's going faster the older you get (except at the dentist or long work meetings).  What you do have to look forward to though is the wisdom that comes from not repeating mistakes but learning from them (assuming you do actually learn from them) such as not buying a steam deck but instead buying every other handheld on the market before realizing that they don't even come close to what the steamdeck does.,SteamDeck

Just you wait sonny, you don't know the half of it.

Why, just yesterday I was in my crappy nappies on the verge of a seizure from the flickering screen of Pac-Man on my Pappy's brand new Atari 2600.

Now, in those days, we had to walk uphill both ways, in two feet of snow, just to get to the arcade. Kids these days complain about microtransactions. Woooo boy, try paying a quarter *every time* you start or continue. Those were *real* microtransactions...

I‚Äôm so glad I did because I now have one and it‚Äôs a major game changer for me. I used to love playing WoW several years ago. And I had to stop because you know, life does that to you sometimes. I couldn‚Äôt dedicate the time to sit down and play at my pc. But now I can take my steam deck anywhere with me, kick on my hotspot and play WoW wherever. 

I truly am glad I was so wrong initially about the Steam Deck.  Valve has made such an amazing device!",SteamDeck
jhikhza,"What you are experiencing is a product built for the the ""right reasons"" this is how us old timers felt when we were waiting for Nintendo's and Sega's.

jhib25z,"I had mine back in June 2022 and the hype has yet to die down for me. I love this thing so much! I had this feeling that, as cool as it is, I would probably end up getting it, messing around with it for a week or two and then never using it again. I am so glad that wasn't true!
Maddeningly, I explained to my wife a few times that my main reason for getting it wasn't to ""main"" the device, but rather to keep as an emergency option for times where I couldn't use my pc e.g. (and I literally used this as an example) if we ever had to go into hospital for extended periods of time. As it turns out, she was diagnosed with MS last year and we're at the hospital regularly now. Crazy how things turn out! If my steam deck broke tomorrow, I would order another ASAP.

jhjeac1,"Similar. I saw the advert for it the day it was officially announced not realising you could put the deposit down until 24 hours later. When I realised, I was gutted but my deposit went down immediately (512GB) and from that day forth, never purchased another Switch game again (or any other game for that matter and focused on building up my Steam library). Sadly, I have an obsessive personality and the wait to actually hold my own in my hands, nearly drove me insane; it felt all consuming and for a year, all I did was consume every snippet of info from every source I could find to keep me going until I got it! I genuinely HATED the wait. I wanted to be one of the first. Call it FOMO, whatever. Anyhow, it was a year to the day ordered when mine finally arrived and it was and is everything I wanted and hoped it would and could be. I love it. The hype here, was fucking crazy. In my mind, it was the one device to rule them all and the trackpads were a deal maker for me. Could it be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô - of course, better screen, better battery and what not -  but does it need to be right now? To me, not at all. My money will be down for a Deck 2 instantly. No hesitation. 

I have many, many other consoles (retro gamer here) and I still have my Switch, my Vita, my Series X and a ¬£4k PC upstairs with a G9 (not flexing at all, I just do) and yet my Steam Deck is my go to. The ease, the convenience, the experience and equally my experience with Valve and the hardware itself has been flawless. Not one problem. 

I‚Äôve customised it with Decky, skinned it, upgraded it (512GB to 2TB) have a 1TB card in it and it‚Äôs used daily. It is MY deck! Currently tidying up all my emulators etc. and the list goes on.

There's also that game which you wouldn't forget even if you only play it for like, once a week or month even. That's Dead Cells for me.

There's also that game where you come back to once a year when a new big update comes in. That's Terraria for me.

Another is a game where you spend most of the time modding, only to play it for a few minutes and comes back again after a week or month. Skyrim and Minecraft.

In regards to your point, indeed. Why is that I somehow do not have the motivation to ""finish"" a game, whether it is story-wise or completion. Especially in open world games, I just play the story for a bit then just loiter around or do side ones.",SteamDeck

The second one is more casual and portable, something I don't have to worry about if I put down for months. This is currently Mario Bowser's fury.

And the last one is completely nonlinear without a narrative. A game just to be a game and can be rotated out for any other games in that pool, mainly meant to just be a past time or if only have like a 20-30 minute gap to game real quick.

What were you doing maxing out that one thread at 3900 MHz??)

If you want to go down that road it is possible to do more. The safest bet would be to increase the max boost clock on the CPU by 100-200mhz, keep the TDP the same etc, then when you have GPU clocks lowered it will be able to boost higher.

However let me point out again that doing such things is at your own risk, and especially if you undervolt there is a severe chance to brick your deck, the above said, it definitely **is** possible to bump up CPU performance a bit, the main risk is from increasing TDP/Temps or from undervolting.

Explore other things first and enjoy it how it is, if you get to a point where you really really want more out of it and are willing to take the risk, start out small like above and see if it helps, and don't get greedy, thats when things go wrong.",SteamDeck

modding the thing is super easy and you can very easily install titles from all 3 of those systems and have them run natively through the system with no emulating involved. even GBA roms are going to run natively if you use virtual console injections, thanks to original DS hardware still being in the system and THAT hardware already being backwards compatible with GBA.

getting an actual 3DS is also going to make the whole dual screen thing less of an annoyance.

Basically, if your looking for accuracy and comfort grab the 3DS. i'd specifically recommend the New 3DS XL.

that being said, if you think your going to want to emulate other, more powerful systems or have an interest in playing old PC stuff, then grabbing a deck is the better option.",SteamDeck

Dude, I'm now playing games that I never got a chance to play in my teen years (i'm 35 now). This thing blows the Switch out of the water. I have like 70 games just from emulation alone across various consoles including PS2, PS3, Wii U, and even Switch lol. I got Metroid Prime Remastered on my Deck when it came out haha.

What really sold it for me was playing Doom Eternal on Ultra Nightmare settings on the Deck and getting a smooth 60fps. I had the same game on the Switch and it's SOOO much better on the Steam Deck! It's night and day. And I haven't even bought Elden Ring and FF7 Remake yet (I'll get those later). 

I had to sell my Switch, games, and accessories as a bundle and took a loss, but I wanted to sell it quickly to get the Deck. I would probably sell the console, games, and accessories separately to get the most $$$ back.

Also, if you do get the Steam Deck, I'd go with the 64gb model and get a 512gb Samsung Pro microSD card (they're like $50 right now). Hella worth it. You can always upgrade the internal SSD later on (it's easy to do).",SteamDeck

IMO it‚Äôs definitely better than a Switch, if only for all the games you have access to that you straight up would not have on the Switch. And many that exist on both that look better on Steam Deck because of the lacklustre textures on Switch; even with an OLED screen.

For probably a similar reason to why you have a Switch in the place, is the biggest perk of the steam deck; portability. You‚Äôre basically getting the PC-gaming library, with the ability to take it anywhere. And you can hook it up to your TV just like the switch and play it console-like like you did with the Switch.

jhk6iew,">Have you considered using another input for menu navigation instead? Left joystick, touchscreen, or even an otherwise unused left trackpad.

Yeah, in case with Risk of Rain 2 I use the left joystick + shoulder buttons instead for menus. But it then gets problematic when I like to (for example) open the player tab menu to hover over items with the cursor.

Since I use ""as joystick"" for the right joystick + gyro action on joystick touch (but without trackpad), the cursor is also too fast there. In some other games, the matter gets even hairier unfortunately. But I used Risk of Rain 2 as an example here.

I had seen that a workaround can be to create an action layer for this that I toggle with a button press. But before I do that (and making my configs too complex), I got really curious if there is perhaps a way to solve this at its root.

And if there sadly isn't, if there is a convenient alternative that I haven't thought of. What would you suggest as a binding here?

>a menu action set to activate **on cursor detection**

Do you mean something like this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/u86h4i/action_set_switch_when_cursor_is_shownhidden_in/)? I haven't seen this in the Steam UI yet, but would be curious to try if this could be a workaround for some (other) games :O Thanks in advance!

If it is a 64gb or 256gb, you could try using an automotive rubbing compound such as ScratchX, however I do not think that is going to help here because most mild abbrasives are not going to remove a scratch from a glass screen.   


Cerium oxide is something that I have heard can be used to remove scratches from glass, but keep in mind that it is a messy process and you could end up causing a warping / halo effect if you dont remove an equal level of glass across the board. You also may introduce other smaller scratches and imperfections during the process.  


With all of this said, the best thing you can probably do is to buy a screen protector and place it on top. The adhesive may help fill in some of the gaps from the scratch and will thus reduce the visual impact it has.

That's what systemd units are for.

I have it on my deck for at least 2 major updates while switching between channels and it works as intended.

>And the article even explicitly points out that this is a prototype they're testing out to see how stable that kind of install is

That's not what was stated in article though. Installer is a prototype, not the method itself. Creating `/nix` and mounting `/home/nix` to `/nix` are pretty simple tasks that is hard to fuck up.",SteamDeck

I did the same to my jsaux, however, my bulge didn't go away no matter what. So I stopped using it, as my OCD didn't like the bulge being there. I'm just gonna wait for my monoblock, it should be exponentially better than the jsaux heatsink.",SteamDeck
jhh8hq3,I don't think there is a thermal pad issue. Enough people have done their own tests on the back plate and results suggest that it doesn't actually worsens the temps or negatively affect the Steam Deck. I'd consider those claims that say the back plate restricts air flow and makes things worse to be bogus.,SteamDeck
jhgve80,is this more effective than what others are doing and cutting a vertical strip on the side to clear that air channel on the left of your heatsink?,SteamDeck
jhh1nmi,">thermal pad issue on the JSAUX back plates.

Is the theory that the thermal pad is restricting airflow to the Steam Deck's fan intake?

I'm also curious if you know if this is strictly theory or if people have numbers showing a negative effect of using the thermal pad.

**To be clear: I am not questioning whether this is a problem** as much as I'm looking to be able to objectively measure the effect and the potency of workarounds.

For example, my concern with this approach would be that the air reaching the fan would be warmed by the surrounding thermal pad. But that could be offset by the fact that moving air rapidly through those channels might itself help cool the JSAUX heat sink.",SteamDeck
jhhtj60,when did you get your backplate if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? i got mine a couple of weeks ago and was surprised to see it snapped on perfectly with no bulge. so i‚Äôm wondering if they did some changes or if i was just strangely lucky somehow?,SteamDeck

jhict5t,"Framerate is not affected by screen size. Otherwise phones with 120hz screens make no sense. If anything the smaller screen lets you reduce the resolution a touch to get better frame rates.  


A locked 60 is always better than a locked 40 and you WILL feel the difference, especially in games where motion is as big a deal as racing games.   


40fps mode is great for a lot of games but lets not pretend it doesn't degrade the experience in motion focused games.",SteamDeck

May we all be so lucky.",SteamDeck
jhmc3a9,"I'd imagine your clean Windows 10 install runs your games better than SteamOS since those games were most likely written for Windows and Proton is a minor miracle.

Except that Windows battery life is shorter since it doesn't have the optimizations or power-saving capabilities of SteamOS. 

And the steady stream of Windows malware and security updates that you commit yourself to keeping up with.

And that Windows rots over time, so random bits of your OS start failing for seemingly no reason and with no solution other than a clean reinstall.

And bundling Windows with the Steam Deck would increase the price per unit by $50-$100 depending how generous Microsoft (a gaming console competitor) was feeling. And Valve would be tying their future to Microsoft's continuing to play ball, a situation which could change at the drop of a hat.

The crux being yes, your statement is shallow but has validity.",SteamDeck

jhmb54r,"I don't know about buggy, but after a year of holding off, I finally tried Windows 11 on the deck and I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up dual booting. Desktop mode on the deck is a joke in comparison to Windows and somehow the TouchPad and trackpads are several factors more responsive. What surprised me the most was that the screen looks better.

I understand I have to keep steam os for firmware updates, but I'm done wrestling with proton to get games and mods working. My Deck install will be for verified small indies going forward and thats about it.",SteamDeck
jhma6nu,It sure is. SteamOS isn't so great whenever you use desktop mode.,SteamDeck

jhmcghl,"> *And that Windows rots over time, so random bits of your OS start failing for seemingly no reason and with no solution other than a clean reinstall.*

This. Quoted for truth. There is no logic, rhyme, or reason to explain how/why things will just randomly go wonky on Windows. Even when you haven‚Äôt changed or done anything recently.",SteamDeck
jhmjza8,"I don't agree that the deck has significantly better battery life in SteamOS. In my testing Windows actually comes on top for everything bar sleep mode, which isn't a factor for me as I don't pick up and play in the same manner I would a Vita or switch. For any windows power user who knows how to debloat and maintain their OS install, Windows rot is less of a concern and it's really not an apples to apples comparison anyway as Steam OS replaces the entire system image every feature update. It's not like I can't do the same thing in Windows with a built in ability to roll back to a previous state to boot. 

I am just as comfortable debloating, managing updates, and changing settings  in Windows as I am using terminal, managing proton versions, and creating prefixes for non-steam applications in SteamOS. Compared to MacOS, neither are as seemless, trouble free or as good battery wise and if I could put steam on my M1 iPad I wouldn't touch my Deck ever again. So this idea that SteamOS is anything but a choice for the Deck or handhelds in general is false. It has its pros and cons as does Windows and you just have to know how to deal with them. There is no perfect soultion for this combination of hardware and software and it's disingenuous to suggest there is.",SteamDeck

That‚Äôs what I love about the deck. I probably wouldn‚Äôt sit at my desk to play games like this, especially since I spend all day working there, but an hour or 2 laying in bed is perfect for these games",SteamDeck

jhdhfzb,Just not very challenging I thought.,SteamDeck
jhbuhom,"As already mentioned, emulating the original is probably a better experience.",SteamDeck
jhfqe23,"No it works!
You just have to select a layout that represents a controller and then reboot the game. There is one pretty high up in the community layouts.  

By default a layout with KB + M is selected so the game thinks that these are connected.  
When launching with a controller layout it immediately recognizes it.",SteamDeck
jhc2pw1,idk I loved that game. It felt so unique and different. Also loved the story. Spoiler: >!loved that it had the exact same ending The Last of Us would have years later!<.,SteamDeck
jhjyxt9,Repetition and encounter variety go hand in hand. I love this game but it had a huge encounter variety problem that the SOT series did not.,SteamDeck
jhjz0iz,Really confused as to why folks are talking about a sequel. Didn't the ending essentially close the door on that?,SteamDeck
jhdac8s,"My favorite PoP game. Has a chill, indie feeling vibe.",SteamDeck
jhcrp57,I‚Äôm enjoying it,SteamDeck
jhca405,"IMO, no. I bought it on sale back in the day and kinda regretted it. It excels at nothing really and the fact that *you just can't die* is a huge dealbreaker for me, there's no stakes in the game. Also, if memory serves me well, the ending was somewhat incomplete and you needed DLC to get more out of it, but I never went to buy as I was quite broke back then.

This said, I see a lot of people in this thread saying they like the game as some kind of hidden gem. To each their own, but that sounds crazy to me. I do agree it could had used a properly made sequel, though.",SteamDeck
jhcrobh,Steam,SteamDeck
jhdaadu,Same! I loved the water color looking art style and the chill vibe of the game.,SteamDeck
jhda8io,"Same. I want to play through the PoP, Far Cry, and Watch Dog games, but no achievements.",SteamDeck
jhbt0fm,"I don't like the steam editions. They weren't good ports for PC at the time and I don't think they work particularly well now, even with the controls.

I've been emulating the PS2 versions and those seem to work pretty well for me.",SteamDeck
jhbmghe,I've played the first of the trilogy and there's a bit of jank but plays well enough with some tinkering. The PC port isn't nearly as optimal and/or as seamless as you would hope for.,SteamDeck
jhcd7mc,You'd be better off emulating the PS2 or Gamecube versions of them. Fantastic trilogy though.,SteamDeck
jhc7zdv,Never finished it either. Felt weird.,SteamDeck
jhbiis5,"I remember this one was very repetitive, but the female companion and her interactions with the prince were amazing.",SteamDeck

jhf58ou,"You bastards, I totally was burning through my backlog of games I hadn't played and now I've got to pause that to replay the SoT games.",SteamDeck
jhcmj69,"Why was that? Because of the lighter tone and the different combat?

I was very young when I played the SoT triology but I felt the same way about POP 2008 and I'm not really sure why.",SteamDeck
jhcnaz3,"An extremely big let down, they should‚Äôve pushed this out as a different series",SteamDeck
jhdfsvd,Unfortunately I think that was only ever released on consoles.,SteamDeck
jhc065l,I dont think they mean the 1989 original :d,SteamDeck
jhdixo8,I like a not so challenging game from time to time. This game is art!,SteamDeck
jhfwrhc,Oh really? This didn't work last time I tried it! Do the button prompts change to Xbox icons?,SteamDeck
jhcd2rl,"The biggest problem was lack of tension. Without the consequences of death and failure the platforming mechanics lost a bit of excitement and depth. I didn‚Äôt play the whole thing so I don‚Äôt know if that persists the whole game. If they did do a bait and switch and made it so later on you lose the safety net that would have been cool, but I didn‚Äôt make it that far.",SteamDeck
jhk0ft0,"No. Elika has to sacrifice herself in order to seal Ahriman away... but you end up going back and undoing everything you did in the game to save her, and letting him out in the process. 

And even though the epilogue DLC has you ""kill"" Ahriman, he ultimately survives and is bloodthirsty for revenge against the prince while Elika leaves to try and find her people. 

Leaving it wide open to a sequel without Elika and having to deal with Ahriman alone.",SteamDeck
jhcuojr,The DLC hedges the ending and ruins something that was legit unique in games at the time. It was The Last of Us‚Äô ending before The Last of Us. Big emotional gut punch. One of my all-time favorites.,SteamDeck

jhd9ghy,Thank you!,SteamDeck
jhbq9vg,Repetitive?,SteamDeck
jhcqh2j,I couldn't stand how she saves you from failure. Completely broke the flow and satisfaction of longer platforming sections if it just revives you back to the last failed jump. Would have preferred the option to disable it in favor of old school checkpoints.,SteamDeck

jhh5xhi,"i cant get it to run, keeps saying that the processor isnt supported and ive been told that the steam port is buggy as hell :(",SteamDeck
jhd4f9k,"very different combat, story wasnt the greatest either, there wasnt much to loose (risk/reward), etc. SoT had a nice theme to it, prince evolved as a character, the dark prince was an interesting dynamic as well with his health and need for sands etc",SteamDeck
jhc6u32,"The 1989 PoP is firmly engrained in my mind from my childhood... So hard for me I never got close to passing the first level, still loved it",SteamDeck
jhc8a5j,"Well, yes. The one on one combat encounters which amount to attack, and usually a defensive measure(parry of some sort of in 2008's case parry and jump function), timed and rhythmic jumping sections. Both combat and the parkour aspect are very rhythmic. You can't just brute force your way through it.

The 2008 game, while a lot easier than the original (and not dependent on beating the game in a certain time), is really harkening back to the original game. The Sands of Time Trilogy still has a lot of aspects but is way more third person adventure-y and much more inspired from PoP3D",SteamDeck
jhdlcv2,I didn‚Äôt like that one I was about 4 although I was fine with games like double dragon I didn‚Äôt like blood in video games in fact I actively looked for out blood less or virtually bloodless games until I was about 17 or 18.,SteamDeck
jhg1n2f,Yes they do. Worked without issues for me,SteamDeck
jhci1fh,the controls aren‚Äôt as tight as you remember. the autosave/death tele was pretty necessary to keep flow and fairness,SteamDeck
jhdw518,"You have the same exact consequences for failing than you did in the Sand of Times trilogy: you respawn at the last checkpoint.

Oh, except 2008 Prince of Persia is harder cause you can't just rewind time a few seconds if you didn't time a jump correctly.",SteamDeck
jhnx0aw,"I was commenting on the original ending I guess. With Ahriman out the world was essentially done and I really liked the finality of that ending.  


Sad to hear there was a ""let's make our perfect ending worse"" DLC.",SteamDeck
jhhtb92,"They work fine. You have to manually select a Steam control layout with controller inputs and restart the game.  
The game somehow defaults to a Keyboard & Mouse layout, and believes no controller is connected. Once a controller layout is selected it switches to controller inputs.",SteamDeck
jhbrsys,"I played it a really long time ago, but from my memory it felt like all the bosses were the same? Plus no time manipulation like in the trilogy.",SteamDeck
jhdvjte,I don't get how this is relevant to his comment,SteamDeck
jhdo56i,"This right here. SoT Prince had a great story arc, fantastic, voice acting and overall the story felt more visceral and tangible even. The graphical style of PoP 2008 gave it a very surreal feel and nothing had any consequence because Elika could save you from every mistake.

That said I did enjoy the 2008 version enough in it's own way. Warrior Within for me was probably my favourite.",SteamDeck
jhdcpam,Haha it was exactly the same for me! I ended up just watching my dad play.,SteamDeck
jhfnbgp,The game that kept me coming back to Radio Shack just to get a taste.,SteamDeck
jhdcm8m,"Thank you for the explanation, i see what u mean now :)",SteamDeck
jhg56yr,"You're right, it works perfectly! Thanks for the heads up",SteamDeck
jhdorca,Then that‚Äôs a bigger problem with the game. They should have baked it longer if was under done. Especially since the previous three were so good.,SteamDeck
jhdx72c,It isn‚Äôt exactly the same. You have a limited number of times you can try that jump and then you get respawned. It felt like a better balance between the two extremes of punishing and hand holding.,SteamDeck
jhnz04i,"No, I'm saying even in the base ending you undo your work and let him free. In order to save Elika. Therefore there could have been a sequel. 

The DLC doesn't really accomplish anything either. As you ""kill"" him. But he ultimately survives and is hunting the prince.",SteamDeck
jhbts3n,"Yeah but the time mechanic started with the trilogy, not the series as a whole",SteamDeck
jhevwkw,"i agree, that is sorta my point. if you think the autosave is the worst part, you haven‚Äôt played it recently. that‚Äôs a welcome bandaid to make it all work.",SteamDeck
jho19vt,My understanding was the Ahriman getting released was effectively the end. The world is done for. That's what makes it the perfect ending for me. The prince realizing that there's no point for him and the world to continue existing if Elika isn't in it and then making the extremely selfish and destructive decision to save her.,SteamDeck

If no other features are coupled to that toggle and nothing else needs the RAM you get a pretty good looking and well running game.

Even on my desktop PC it has always been a wise decision to buy a GPU with more VRAM instead of a faster one. That usually ended up severely extending its lifetime.",SteamDeck
jhj4acj,"I had a very similar experience to you, but I recently bought a dolphinbar and it pretty much solved all my issues. Essentially, it acts as the IR sensor AND the Bluetooth adapter for the wii remotes.

Then, you select the real wii remote option in dolphin and you should be good to go.

I think the main problem is that when you connect a wii remote through the steam deck‚Äôs Bluetooth, steam tries to take control of the input, leaving it in a pretty much unusable state.",SteamDeck

jhi6o3j,"Some immediate thoughts:

- Does the right trackpad work fine in most games you play? It's worth checking to eliminate the chance that the hardware is at fault.

- How have you set up Heroic? Do you add games to SteamOS' game mode with Heroic's option to do that, or do you have a single entry where you load Heroic and then load a game on top of it? My line of thinking is that if it's the latter, and that both is loaded, something in the control scheme is interacting with Heroic, pulling that input away from the game.

Lastly, more of a tip: if you want an official controller profile for a non-steam game that's on Steam, you can change the game's name temporarily to the numerical ID it's registered under (in Darkest Dungeon's case, it's 262060). When you do that, it'll look at controller profiles under 262060, which in turn will be the profiles for the game that you can save before changing the name back. Handy for Doom mods!",SteamDeck

I didn't use the steam deck a lot. The trackpad always works in Desktop mode, and it worked fine in DeskJob. When it was not working in Darkest Dungeon, after closing the game it was working again. So I suppose it is not an hardware issue

&#x200B;

> How have you set up Heroic? 

I go to Desktop mode, launch heroic and execute the game from there. When I go home I will try the other setup. Many thanks!

Thank you for the tip! Very useful!",SteamDeck
jhmsjr6,Hey! I tried to add the game on Steam as you said and the pad works well now! Many thanks!,SteamDeck

I didn't respond, just kept playing my game. All the sudden I feel a tickle on my ear as he whispers, ""I'll let you hold mine if you let me hold yours."". I look over at him in horror as he whips it out... ""Ohhhh a White PS Vita. No I don't want to hold it."". He looked sad, stopped jerking off, and went on his way.

But then it felt that people were scowling at me as they walked by. Sure enough, I started to hear whispers and murmering beneath their breath as they walked by. 

Finally, I had to ask my brother why people were so freaked out by someone using a handheld device to play video games simply because it's not on a Nintendo product. 

My brother simply shook his head and said, ""Robert ... we're Amish."" So now I play with my Deck under a blanket in the barn late at night, to hide my shame from God.

I am very self conscious at times but I just throw on music of an audio book and embrace the weirdness that is me. Currently playing Lego The Hobbit while listening to The Hobbit ü§£.

jhbyw57,"Yeah my PSP Go is the handheld that actually goes out in the wild with me.  Way more pocketable and works perfectly for waiting room gaming or waiting in line quick bursts.  The slider sleep function is almost perfect.

Steamdeck is more for allowing me to game at home and not be tethered to a certain room or chair.  I have a massive Big Joe bean bag in my living room and it's so wonderful to come home on my lunch break and just chill on there and game.  Also I'm getting older and having some issues with neck pain so sitting and staring at a TV causes alot of issues.   The Deck allows me to get in the most comfortable position and game out.  

The Deck to me is like having a hardbound book.  I prefer it but I wouldn't carry it around in public to read, I would bring a paperback.  That's the Deck for me, reading in bed, chilling on the couch while my wife finally gets a chance to watch her favorite shows when the kids go to bed.",SteamDeck

It‚Äôs usually when I was able to (with other consoles like the switch), I never felt like it. When my commute included about 30/40min of train riding, that wasn‚Äôt ever nearly enough time to entice me to play. You barely start and have to stop again. Even whipping out a Gameboy or something, I just never feel the drive to progress in any game, and I don‚Äôt really play games you could maybe classify as ‚Äûidle games‚Äú (think tetris if you‚Äôre old school).    
   
Apart from that, there‚Äôs no situation when I would be in public with enough spare time. Maybe a really long train ride and probably wait times, but realistically I‚Äôm behind the wheel of a car anyways and I think it‚Äôs frowned upon if I play games while driving :‚ÄòD",SteamDeck

I work in electric utilities, so downtime is unpredictable and can be lengthy. A power brick is useful if you don't want to leave the truck running, and bluetooth headphones mean you can play while your coworker sleeps.

There are not as many games and no real cloud saves, but it kinda just works and is big enough without being TOO big.

Had one guy get excited that I had the deck. Watched me play Rayman 2 on the n64 emulator.

jhe3spt,"I'm passed caring and being ashamed of being a gamer. 

I used to feel embarrassed about being a gamer because of the criticism I received from my dad, my brother, and even my ex. But as I got older, I realized that I am proud of who I am and what I have accomplished. Despite coming from a difficult background, I have built a good life for myself through hard work and perseverance

Look here, young and old alike:
Gaming has always been my way of decompressing and having fun, especially during the tough times. Nowadays, as a well-of and good-looking 33-year-old with a beautiful girlfriend and a 1-year-old son, I don't have much free time. But when I do, I still love playing video games on my Steam deck, whether I'm at home or on the go. 

My dad smacked the shit out of us and my mum. He never seemed ashamed of who he was. So many reasons exist to be ashamed in this life and all those people doing bad things live their life without batting an eye.

I left home as soon as I could with not a cent to my name. I was couch surfing until I could afford a place. I had to study and work to sustain myself. Gaming was the thing I did for so many years to have fun and enjoy myself. It was cheap accessible I could do it right there at home. 

A couple of weeks ago I sat in front of this cute woman on the train and noticed her looking at me. I sat and said ""hello"" she looked quite interested as while I was sitting, taking my jacket off and stuff I noticed her looking at me a couple more times. Me, I had a one hour trip and the aforementioned beautiful girlfriend at home... It flatters me but this is my ""me time"". I took my SD and began playing Bannerlord. (I used to play warband on the shitiest laptop back in the day :D). Now...If you could imagine how shocked that woman looked. I felt her judging me sooo much. I'm happy I'm no longer with a girl like that.

It actually made me smile right then and there looking at my screen for a while. Reminded me of all these posts I saw here on reddit of people feeling uncomfortable playing in public. I see why, but their judging eyes won't make me ashamed. Such a small and superficial thing. It's our hobby... Geez. 

Gaming doesn't make you lazy or immature - it's just a hobby that you happen to be passionate about.

So, if you're a gamer like me, don't be ashamed of who you are. It doesn't matter what other people think - what matters is that you enjoy what you do and that you are a good person.

2) A steam backpack. You know the type there are hundreds of them. I use this when I go places and know I will end up with my hands full. Situations like returning home from grocery shopping. Also allows me to take my charger and battery pack with me.

3) The original Steam Deck case. The scenario I use this one for is one in which I never plan on using the original case again, so it just gets stashed in a drawer. Which is an everyday scenario.

Moreover, you can't flash new things to a phone unless the owner went out of their way to unlock the bootloader. Unlockable bootloader does NOT mean unlocked out of the box. USB debugging is also not available out of the box, and even if it WAS you still need to get past the lock screen to access an android phone via ADB on an unregistered computer.

First, you're conflating two very different things, you can factory reset an android phone from any recovery mode, it wipes the phone of all data. Most of these are even managed by the device distributors themselves, there are plenty of phones including pixels that can just be reset even on [Android 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5no9BbqP65w). If you just want to sell or pawn the phone, this is the best route, many shady pawn stores will also just take the phone locked and just give people less money and factory reset themselves.

The US Government did not want to just factory reset the phone to sell it, they wanted to recover data from the phone to preserve evidence, which is a massive privacy violation. These things are not the same, at all. iPhones will just reset and wipe themselves, and the government didn't want this, because they wanted the data on the phone, and without the pin they couldn't get it.

1. So the gameplay is really fun now with plenty of content if you get the DLCs. It's also a bit more polished, but it's still an AA game, not an AAA game qualitywise.
2. Performance in the game is rough. I don't think it should've been verified. When you're just zooming around in space you can get a reasonable 30fps with the default settings. But that drops into the low 20s when you encounter a battle involving more than a couple ships, or when you walk around on a station. Even turning the settings down doesn't help tremendously much. Perversely, turning the settings lower actually makes it look better in some ways - the shadows and especially volumetric fog are kind of ugly on the Deck's small screen. But ultimately, I decided to uninstall X4 from my Deck and rely entirely on streaming via moonlight (which works amazingly) from my desktop to play it because the performance was just not great enough for my liking.
3. Once you get going it's super fun, but there's a hard learning curve and it can take awhile to get into. It's sort of like Privateer or Freelancer, if you were Lando Calrissian instead of Han Solo. Going from some hobo in a scout ship with nothing in your name to the owner of a space empire with fleets of capital ships and even your own sectors and stations is pretty cool.

The controls were a big concern for me too; I ended up having to use a community control config to get them the way I wanted. The main issue was commanding my empire from the map; it works much better when you set one of the touchpads to behave as a mouse for that part of the game.

jhf21jt,"Yeah, I think if the system was limited and the games were targeted for its hardware and had their settings locked down, like a Switch, the battery life wouldn't even be a complaint. The reason people complain is because the system *allows* them to crank things up, max out the hardware, and drain the battery in an hour and a half (or play games that wouldn't even be ported to it, due to high battery drain, if it was a regular console). The ability to do that is part of what makes the Deck *awesome*, but it also makes people more aware of a limitation that *would probably exist on the Switch too* if you could tweak the video settings for each game and crank things way up...

What compounds the issue, though, is that a lot of the bigger games *default* to trying to max out the system's capabilities. For example, when I installed Horizon Zero Dawn I was only getting an hour and a half out of it with the default settings, but I was easily able to get over 4 hours out of it after adjusting a few things. If the Deck was a regular console like the Switch, the devs would probably tune that game's settings for 3.5-4 hours of battery life, lock it down, and no one would ever experience that 1.5-hour low (and would also never experience the graphical fidelity those settings allow).  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",SteamDeck

jhhqlez,"Yeah, but I chose the control scheme in Game Mode before switching to Desktop Mode to play, and the hotkeys still didn‚Äôt work.

Being this much of a dismissive dick obviously comes very easy, I note.",SteamDeck
jhhrr1h,"I actually dont know that it would work in desktop mode. It might, but I dont know how... (actually while writing this - I remembered. see below)

So here is the deal.

Those back buttons (R4 in our case), arent ""xbox style controller buttons"". They are just ""ALIEN press thingies, that are not buttons at all, as far as pretty much any emulator and any program that would recognize an xbox controller"" is concerned.

So you need something ""early and powerfull"" to set those buttons meaning before they reach the emulator, and set them to keyboard inputs - which then the emulator can recognize, because all PC emulators know what a keyboard is. :)

That ""something early and powerfull"" is steam controller configuration. Which you normally should only touch in game mode. Why to follow soon.

For that you also need to have steam running all the time, otherwise no steam controller configuration active. (if you cant pull up the software keyboard, steam is not running - just as a fyi, because its controlled the same way)

Now there is an additional complication, and that is, that Desktop mode, puts another ""controller configuration"" SWITCH on top of that.

When you boot up into Desktop mode, it sets all the steam controller controls to a ""Mouse mode"", meaning, space, and enter, and ESC and mouse buttons are mapped, and the controller doesnt behave like a controller at all. But rather like a mouse.

You can switch that by pressing the start button (what on a PS3 controller would be a start button) for 3 seconds, then in desktop mode you get a popup, that gamecontroller mode was enabled, then the controller acts like an xbox controller -

with two exceptions - trackpads still behave like a mouse, and backbuttons arent mapped, because they arent part of a classic Xbox controller.

Now comes the fun part.

In Desktop mode, steam can not differenciate which window ""is active"" at a time, so does NO game controller profile switching, based on what programs you open.

And changing the stock mouse mode or gamepad mode configurations for desktop mode in steam, is strongly discouraged - because, if you mess up mouse mode... The easiest way to revert that for a large subsection of ""non technical"" people would be to install the OS again.

Thats why the ""only configure steam controller input overlay stuff in game mode"" is a hot tip we sometimes tell people.

Now - in game mode, controller profiles are switched to active, based on the steam shortcut you launch in game mode.

So if you have different shortcuts for citra and the actual games you want to play in citra (so if they show as different shortcuts), you would have to set it in both.

Long story short. Play Citra (and actually more generally, most) games in game mode, and it will just work.

With much more details in this post to get it working in desktop mode as well, but also while strongly discouraging you from doing so. (In case you mess up desktop mouse config.)

Also - thats it, no more help from me, because you called me a dick.

Good luck on finding someone else to explain to you the 5 potential controller configuration layers in steam, from now on, because no one does.


Take this as a learning experience.",SteamDeck
jhhsvja,"A bit of clarification and explanation! Thanks for that.

I see you say ‚Äúplay most games in game mode‚Äù, which ordinarily I‚Äôd be happy to do, but the 3D emulation in this case doesn‚Äôt work in game mode, so it has to be run in desktop mode. In this case it absolutely *won‚Äôt* ‚Äújust work‚Äù.

Still, you‚Äôve given me some ideas to try, so that‚Äôs useful! Thanks for that too.

As an aside I called you a dick because you were being a judgmental dick and leapt to a completely false assumption. It‚Äôs also interesting that what you tried to handwave away in your earlier post has subsequently taken you upwards of 17 paragraphs to explain, all because you wanted to try and make me appear ignorant and lazy. 

I‚Äôm actually grateful for your more detailed explanation - thank you for that - but you absolutely were being a dick and I called you out on it. It would have cost you nothing to share the initial link in your post and put something like ‚Äúhave you made sure to set the controller scheme in game mode?

Why don‚Äôt you take this as a learning experience not to try and score points off someone who‚Äôs looking for help?",SteamDeck
jhhyla9,"except that it does.

if you mean skipping and the game being slow. use powertools to turn smt off (that would make it behave almost exactly to desktop mode performance wise (because it does a very similar thing to desktop mode in terms of how it presents the cores to the emulator)).

or wait for the steam os 3.5 patch that should fix this kernel bug so you get better single core performance in game mode as well.

As for your retort, because I help 20 people a day on average (nowadays more like 10), and you need something to differenciate who is capable of learning stuff, and who would just respond with lol, tldr;

so you start with the least effort possible basically. after a year of doing this.. ;)

If its not performance related, citra 3ds emulation in game mode works. Thats the only thing I can tell you. If you havent found a way to ""launch the emulator alone"" in desktop mode, and installed it via emudeck - steam rom manager, make sure the emulators parser is checked (green meaning active), and then preview, generate applist and add to steam. that way you can launch the emulator itself in game mode as well. an pick games installed on the 3ds internal storage f.e.

if you need a mouse in game mode, in steam controller config map one to right touchpad, map leftmouseclick to right touchpad down click.",SteamDeck
jhi4hnt,"Only it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm talking very specifically about not being able to play 3ds games in stereoscopic 3D from game mode - because you can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm aware that you can play 3ds games *without* 3D from game mode, but that‚Äôs not what I want to do.

My specific problem is that I cannot switch screens when playing a 3ds game in 3D - the button mapped to that function in the controller scheme in desktop mode does not switch screens when you press it.",SteamDeck
jhi6g29,"You still havent got it right - 

I'm not dealing with people who want others to service them long time, when the information was already presented to them on a silver platter.

Emulator controller configuration maps swap screen to a keyboard input. you can look that up in the emulator controller config if you must. Or in the controller profile emudeck provides FOR GAME MODE ONLY. (In there L4 would be mapped to a keyboard input. To the same keyboard input, for both.)

You would configure back buttons in the steam gamepad mode config (the one thats an alternative you can switch to in desktop mode by long pressing start, with mouse mode being active as the standard once you boot into desktop mode) thats available to configure in steam itself, you would switch to it in desktop mode, after you've made configuration changes there by long pressing the start button, because steam input starts up in mouse mode, when you boot to desktop.

And if you mess up configuring the gamepad mode in steam in desktop mode, or even more catastrophic, the mouse mode - there is no one out there willing to walk you through resetting that, with a potetntially messed up mouse control scheme...

Also your ""service me longtime"" attitude is horrific. Just saying - take a clue. Read the information thats already on the page.

Because I'm telling you dont do this, if you are prone to not know what you might change in a controllerconfig, that then affects everything once you boot into desktop mode.

Also an option to reset that controller config in the steam desktop mode layout was not there in the beginning of steam os, so people who did, had to literally reset their steamdeck. Thats where the anxiety comes from, by now a way to reset it in desktop mode might have been added, but I'm in no way stupid enough to try to mess with that config in desktop mode, then fail, and then try to get back to default, just so I could tell the tale.

Thats you - because you actually seem to have a motive.

I could also teach you how to change emualtor settings in game mode, becuase its literally the same emulator window, just in a different UI, but I dont know what other programs you might need to have to run in tandem to get stereoscopic 3D to work (in game mode its kind of one program active, one programe maybe in the background and thats it), and frankly, I'm disgusted by you just endlessly pushing for someone else to do the work.

And that comes from me doing 20 minutes support sessions for people having messed up controls, but having no idea anymore in which of the 5 controller configuration layers they might be dealing with, when f.e. playing a retroarch game that was launched via emulation station, in desktop mode.

Then there are literally 5 controller input layers active at all time.

I've explained that 5 times in detail (not to you, but in here and other outlets), no more flipping chance I'd do it again. So thats the core emotion I connect with this issue.",SteamDeck
jhi7q08,"Also, I'm still unclear on one concept, and that is, if the controller profile gets switched, if you start the same steam shortcut, from steam in desktop mode, that you configured to use the emudeck preset in game mode.

I dont think so, but it might, so you can try that as well.

I dont think so, because you could then switch focus away from that window, and steamdeck controls would still be set to what that window wanted them to be set. And that sounds to me like somthing Valve wouldnt leave in by mistake.

But I'm actually still unsure what the behavior in that situation is, so you could try it...",SteamDeck

It‚Äôs precisely because I don‚Äôt want to irreparably mess with controller configs that I came here to seek answers.

You also clearly don‚Äôt know how the deck works in conjunction with the nreal glasses - which is fine - and you *finally* admit that in your post here. I already knew that it doesn‚Äôt work in game mode, because that was established by the user who developed the process for enabling stereoscopic gaming when using the deck in conjunction with the nreal glasses. As such, your threat to withhold knowledge of how to change emulator settings in game mode is both (a) irrelevant and (b) pointless as I already know that there is no emulator setting that currently exists that would get the 3D functionality to work in game mode, becaus game mode has dynamic scaling.

I‚Äôm disgusted that you explain yourself so poorly and opaquely and then blame the person who‚Äôs reading your post for your own lack of clarity.

Even when supporting your efforts might have lead to you doing more harm, if you change any of the wrong profiles or settings, and getting you up to speed entails explaining to you at least how three different layers of controller configuration work on steamdeck.

So learn about the mentioned aspects (I differentiated three different controller configuration layers for you, twice).

With your first response being ""my support agent isnt respectful enough"", but what was wrong with my approach, why did it all end like this?

I mean I clearly stated ""you are disrespectful"", ""you are a dick"", ""I came here"", and ""I bought a thing"" (two thing actually), and ""do you even speak english, this all sounds like gibberish to me"" -- so now I get personalized step by step instructions that I understand, right?!

It's too big and heavy. The vita is better suited to that type of emulation because its small and light, more akin to a gameboy or gameboy advance. Though when I started zelda a link to the past (the snes version) on the deck I was amazed at how good it looked, the colours and sharpness was great for how old the game is. I never had a snes or played many games from that time frame (I'm a 90's kid and grew up on the PS1 and PS2) but if you showed me that game without telling me what it was I wouldn't have said it was a snes game.

jh8tim2,"This is something I was super concerned about but being able to transfer games through steam without having to deal with download speeds from the device itself, using One Drive for important files, steam cloud saves and an external SSD are the solution for this.

jh9wz6n,"I basically won't play the same game on my desktop and Deck.  It's too annoying to wonder if the Steam Cloud is working or fucking it all up.

Not having that nailed down 100% is one of the two biggest gripes I have with the Deck (the other being the screen feeling like a cheap out compared to every other aspect of the hardware, just look at OP's photo, so much bezel and only mediocre colors, while the Deck beats all the other devices in controls, power, ergonomics, etc).

Last time I tried to play a game on Deck and PC, I lost all my saves.  Installed a game on PC that I was playing on Deck, and Steam took my empty save folder on PC and overwrote my 30hour save on the cloud...",SteamDeck
jh9a6md,"Don't know about OP, but in my case I originally only wanted a Switch for the portability and possibility to play some of my favourite games on the go. 

... Thing is, none of those games are Nintendo titles, and I personally have never really cared for Nintendo games or even liked them that much. So even though I almost got the Switch for myself a couple times, I eventually went back on my decision because of that, because it simply wasn't worth it to pay +300‚Ç¨ just to be able to play Witcher 3 and two more games on a train ride, especially when so many of my favorite games are not on the Switch either and the console itself is mostly geared toward gaming franchises that I simply do not care about.

Getting a Deck has completely replaced the need for me to ever get a Switch. Truthfully, the only Switch games I'd play ATM are Smash Bros and Mario Kart, which are precisely the games I bought my brother when we got him his Switch last Christmas. He's really into Nintendo games and he'd been wanting that console for a really long time. So it all worked out in the end.",SteamDeck
jh91swd,"Great question. Honestly my plan was to get the Aya neo line up but I soon realized that maybe it was better to have a more colorful collection with devices from different brands. After getting my Deck I scored the aya neo 2021 retro power and started from there. 

I know all of them have the same chipset and specs but for me is all about the design and different gimmicks. After having 3 6800u devices I decided to stop because even if they had different designs that was just a little too much. The last one I was going to get was the onexplayer 2 but as soon as they announced the ROG Ally I decided to wait and get that one instead. 

I‚Äôm not really into cloud gaming devices because as we all know they depend a lot on a good internet speed and I‚Äôm not really a fan on them really.

Thank you for the appreciation comment!!",SteamDeck
jh92gbj,Thank you so much. I would say that my daily driver is my Miyoo mini because of the size. It‚Äôs smaller than a Joycon and can play up to ps1 games.

jh92nfi,I mean the deck has a really special place for me. Steam os is extremely practical and simple to use after a while and being able to quickly go from days gone to vampire survivors is something out of this world but my Win 4 is very very close to the deck. Not only because I got it for the base price which was about 900$ but because it is very practical too.

They all perform better than the deck when using them with 15 watts or more but the battery drains faster when you use more than 20 watts. I would say that if you‚Äôre looking for an alternative option with windows to play unsupported games than you should wait for the ROG Ally to see how the prices are going to be. If that device is less than 1000$ you should give a try!

In my case I would only pick the GPD Win 4 over the deck because of how portable and powerful it is. Awesome physical keyboard  and the very cool psp like design.",SteamDeck

The win 4 is very powerful, more than the Deck, comes with windows 11 and is super portable.

I only had 2 consoles, GameCube (I literally BEG for it) and a N64 (My lovely Godfather brought from the US)

Been working since I was 8-7 years in a mini market (colmado) with my dad (not by choice) I had to woke up at 3am every fucking day in order to be back home around 6:30, take a shower and go to school til 1pm‚Ä¶ Then, work again at 6pm - 9pm.

Besides the things that they‚Äôre meant to be providing me as a kid, I was never ever gifted something else‚Ä¶ Just more work, everybody got a PSP (I didn‚Äôt) I got the GameCube by miracle.

Gaming being one of them. I now have each and every console that I wanted as a kid. My brothers always asks me, why do I still play old school games, while there are so many new AAA games in market.

I hear you on the ROG Ally as well. I do like 80% of my gaming on the Deck these days and love AAA games, so if the price is right I will probably upgrade. 

With that said though, I hope they can provide a decent software experience because that is what really sets the Deck apart imo. I hate using Windows on a touchscreen. It just feels awful and makes it feel like a hacked together DIY project compared to SteamOS feeling like a polished console. 

I'm also bummed there's no touchpads on the Ally. Am I the only one who absolutely loves the touchpads on the Steam Deck? Once you get used to them, using the touchpads in unison with the gyro makes for an amazing FPS experience that joysticks just can't match. Yet no other manufacturers seem to value adding them to their competitors. 

So while the Ally looks awesome and I might buy one. If they released a Steam Deck Pro at the same time, it would be no contest on which one I'd buy. With that said though Asus has been making some amazing hardware in recent years. My Zephyrus G15 is a game changer of a gaming laptop.

Learning systems. Businesses. Coding languages. Etc isn't ""luck"" these are things that require effort and dedication that absolutely betters one position. I broke free from a poverty cycle. 

>Lots of people work hard and never get lucky.

No. Lots of people run in place. They never adapt or solution their situation. If you work really hard at a call center expect to stay a glorified phone clerk.

Edit: lazy mfers mad lolololol",SteamDeck
jhci2d5,"I agree with much of what you said, but.. I would say that having luck or generational wealth as a pre-requisite for success is misleading and/or undervaluing the potential for success which comes from a combination of hard work + skill, raw talent, or intelligence. While yes I‚Äôd agree that simply working hard is not enough for *anybody* to become successful- it‚Äôs more than enough for the right people to become successful (by that I mean those who are gifted intellectually, or have a rare talent which they are able to figure out how to capitalize off of through hard work, or they are genetically predisposed to be at the top of whatever given field assuming that they apply their raw potential and act on it.
I agree that lots of people get lucky, and there are plenty of people that work really hard and never get anywhere‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs *not always* the failure of the system preventing them from getting further through their hard work, sometimes it‚Äôs something else- like working really hard in a field that‚Äôs over saturated or that your skills aren‚Äôt well suited for, or sometimes it‚Äôs the failure to see when a career path is a dead-end (whether that‚Äôs b/c of an employer or the industry at large, people very often fail to see when the industry they devoted lots of time and resources into is no longer a sustainable option for future success). 
All that said, of course luck can and does often play a large role in success. But, my point is that one can be successful without the help of any luck whatsoever. It just takes the right mindset, a willingness to adapt and pivot, and sometimes a lot of patience and willingness to ‚Äúre-start‚Äù in a new field once it‚Äôs clear that the field you had worked hard to grow in is no longer a field which has a sustainable path to grow a career. 
So I guess, without (any) luck it can become pretty difficult and often requires much more then *just hard work*, however: I absolutely believe with the right mindset and determination one can be successful without any luck at all.",SteamDeck

jhhogpr,"While a game is running:

L3+R3 > Video > Aspect ratio. Set aspect ratio there.

Then find

Quickmenu > Overrides > save as content directory override and

Quickmenu > Overrides > save as game override

Do both for good measure. (game override saves it per game and has the capability to override all general settings, content directory override saves it per game system (think snes).)

You have to do this per system (so think snes). If you friend managed to do that ""globally"", they are really talented. :)

And if you friend managed to do it ""by moving/modifying bezel dimensions"" this wont help and you would be still effed.

In that case, your best path of action is a nuke.

Before nuking retroarch though, you might try

Emudeck --> Tools --> emu guides --> retroarch --> reset config

in desktop mode, but if your friend was creative, that might not do what you want. (because 3 different configs per emulator core)

If you need to nuke:

In linux file explorer make sure that ""show hidden files and folders is enabled"", then find:

home/.var/apps/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch/

and find the save and the (savestate) folders in there, make sure to back up every file thats in there. Do it. No crying afterwards.

After that delete the entire org.libretro.RetroArch folder from /home/.var/apps/

And install emudeck again, just over the existing installation is fine.
That then will install and setup Retroarch again.

The issue being that all those settings can be set in three different files per ""emulator core""; so you really have to know where to look, and I dont have the time to explain.. :)",SteamDeck

Failing that you can get them over here in AU, but only through an importer (such as Kogan, unfortunately) with a fairly hefty markup. I paid $829AU I think for a 64GB, and it arrived within a couple of days.

Also there may be warranty complications when buying one overseas vs onshore.

If you're so inclined it's very easy to upgrade as well - I got a deal on a 1TB SSD and installing that took all of about 15 minutes. Kind of worth it IMO if you're buying in Australia because the 512GB models are insanely expensive here, but a 64GB + an SSD isn't too bad.",SteamDeck

A quick tip for using the trackpads: it's about swipes. Don't treat the pad as a flat joystick that you move your thumb around the way you would a push a joystick. Treat it like a flat surface that you send your thumb across like you would swipe away your phone notifications.

There's a bit of a work around to install battle net on deck I haven't done it yet, but it doesn't seem very complicated.

jhf7kei,"Just understand one important thing also. Because I tried to use my steam as a gaming computer in a 1440p screen (computer screen). 
The resolution is too high for the deck to be handle correctly, so I downgrade it in 720p and it‚Äôs blurry as fuck. 
If I use a TV screen then the blurry effect is less present. But that‚Äôs another story. 

If you plan to use a screen, try to take something not too big. 1080p screen in 16:10 or 16:09 work well, but when you go to bigger (ok it‚Äôs a 3440x1440p so twice the capacity of the deck screen‚Ä¶) it‚Äôs not easy. 

For world of Warcraft I was using a 1080p screen and it was great (until the screen died. A old buddy I‚Äôve got since my winter 2008)

The Steam Deck has the same GPU whether you have a screen or not, if you run a 1440p monitor at 720p it‚Äôs blurry, has nothing at all to do with the Steam Deck. 

The way to look at it is that 2560 X 1440 is QHD. 

It‚Äôs almost 4x the resolution of the Steam Deck display. As a rough rough number, If you can run it with 25% or 30% performance, then you‚Äôre gonna be fine running at 1440p. If not try 720p or get FSR happening. I believe there is a also a few other scaling models that it can do if you‚Äôre doing a nice square scale up from 720p to 1440p.

jhc2dr5,"The numbers I've found point towards a little less raw power (but years of technical advancements) compared to the base PS4.

It just tries to lower resolution internally to hit the FPS target, so in mine it does not give the option of 40fps but 45fps, whatever the case it seems to automatically scale down when needed and looks really good still :)

It can be a little stuttery sometimes but then If I recall I'm running it at 6 or 7 watts on the APU with GPU clocks set to 600 or 700mhz, it definitely dips in cutscenes but gameplay was pretty good :3

jhcnfm5,"Depends on what you're running on. Maybe I should've specified some caveats as I am kinda comparing apples and oranges. I didn't mean to be disingenuous, so let's clear that up

The average pc gamer according to Steam still runs a 720p monitor and at 3x that resolution (I run 3 monitors as one ultrawide) an RX580 outpaces the PS5 in most game's ""performance"" mode which can reach up to 120 fps at 1080p if you ignore the fact that the RX580 doesn't have RT or DMA but is also not optimized for.

The PS5's 4k maxes out at 60FPS and many games on the RX580 will nearly reach the same output if you drop settings a little bit. It should also be noted that I haven't played the newer, more graphically intense games, and my results are more skewed towards older titles, which typically run without much work on either system

If you compare using the raw specs, yes, the RX580 lags behind a bit, especially with RT (which it actually can do with newer drivers, but don't expect more than 15fps@720p).",SteamDeck
jhap3xd,"I don't think you can quite max out Returnal with vram to spare, at least not on the mobile 6gb version. And I had to set rt to low. At higher settings, it probably takes up a lot more.

How about Doom Eternal? I think a texture pool size of High/Ultra is the best I can get with the 6gb vram I get on the mobile gpu. The ultra nightmare with Rt on probably will need close to 8gb vram. So, doesn't PS5 just use a lower texture quality setting in this case?",SteamDeck

If you want to talk about last year, then how about Elden Ring? Even with the pc port having problems, the 3060M can play it at 60 @2K with nearly everything maxed out.

jhijxu5,"No, this method is worse, as I described, because it has you pry around the edge, marring the seam. But thanks for the downvotes, I guess no one else will learn how to open their Deck without messing up the seam. Pat yourself on the back",SteamDeck
jhilanu,"Honestly, I prefer to pry at the edges so that the plastic tabs holding it together come away with much less risk of breaking. Pulling directly on the handles like that seems like it has a much higher risk of breaking a tab, which, granted, won't be visible from the outside. 

Oh, except for the seam where your device doesn't quite close right.

&#x200B;

>This is way better than using a pry tool or pick or whatever plastic item for going around the edges, which will damage the seams, if even just a little.

It really shouldn't if you do it right. The opening tools are of a softer plastic than the Steam Deck shell, so the only way you're going to damage it is if you use too much force and go too fast. And that's exactly what the author of the article did.",SteamDeck
jhiplnn,"Those plastic tools don't mar the edge when used properly. This is my gig. I do it for a living, and the number of devices I have scarred is far, *far* less than the number that are returned with no problems.

> This is my gig. I do it for a living

I'm also an electronics engineer. I've been working on electronics for 30 years. Probably longer than you. Being an electronics engineer is not _an argument_ here.

> the number of devices I have scarred is far, far less than the number that are returned with no problems

so you admit you've messed up at least a few devices. So let's take this from thinking about someone like you who is a professional repair technician and to a homemaker who only has one deck to mess up, and isn't going to go through a few as a learning exercise. It's better to show those people a method that has a higher chance of success. There's _no reason_ to use those plastic pry tools, they have no advantage over what I show. Conversely there's _good reason_ to use the method I describe. Which, I'll guess, you have never even tried, yet you argue against it. Most likely because you're personally invested in the ways you do things, rather than thinking about this objectively.

> prying at the trigger can cause cracking around that edge, and can deform the case around the trigger

No, it can't. I've been using this method for at least 10ish years now on many different controllers as well as on the steam deck since it first came out. It's never left behind any marring, let alone cracks. That's because the plastic in that spot is structural and needs to be thicker for when you drop the controller and it falls on that edge. It's resilient. Again, you're arguing against something you haven't tried once.

> makeshift tools

the pry tools you recommend were invented as makeshift tools for opening mobile phones by people melting old toothbrush handles. That's why they have that form. That's not an argument at all. As an electronics repair engineer you have to always be ready to invent new and better tools when existing ones have an issue, such as having to mar a few steam decks before you learn how to open one without damaging it.",SteamDeck
jhit9fx,">This is my gig. I do it for a living, and the number of devices I have scarred is far, *far* less than the number that are returned with no problems. 

Haha, yeah, you only know how badly things can go when you've been through breaking a few retaining tabs yourself.",SteamDeck
jhjfzbe,"> OP took the admonition to get the proper tools to mean other makeshift tools that also were not designed to open your electronic device

no, i'm an electronics engineer, and i have about 50 different pry tools, and this is the best one for that job. i've been doing electronics for the last 30 years. you're projecting incompetence, and that's arguing in bad faith.

7. Save the configuration and run the game.

If you want to add the game to Game Mode, close Steam in Desktop Mode and once it closes right click on the game in lutris and select ""Add steam shortcut"".

I don't know of people blindly following anything and just upgrading because they feel like it. There are legitimate reasons to use an SSD over the SD card even for shaders and one of the many aside from performance is, SD card life, this is a disclaimer on the tools themselves. It's best to keep write operations to SD cards at a minimum, and with the amount of cache updating it's going to wear on the card.

If you're cool with that, then go for it.

Now SSDs claims a smaller write cycle amount, but the cells are much larger and the backups are much more robust so getting an entire write-erase cycle takes much much longer on SSDs than on SD Cards, thanks to the NAND standard.

Furthermore as SSDs fail, they just get smaller, SD Cards will start to get corrupted data which will further degrade the card.

While I didn‚Äôt use their Wi-Fi options, my games worked just fine offline on the plane. If you haven‚Äôt tried this already, be sure you are connected to Wi-Fi (for example at home before you leave for the airport) and go to Settings then Internet and there is an option for turning on offline mode.

jhhs2ln,"Hey I thought it was just me or the TV I was using.

I have found that if I disconnect the power adapter from the dock (leaving HDMI plugged in) then connecting the dock to the deck, this allows the TV to negotiate HDMI without issue, then I can plug the power adapter back into the dock and it continues to work as expected.

Obviously shouldn't have to do that, but it's way less frustrating than rebooting, reseating HDMI, etc that I was doing to fix it before.

One interesting thing is if I have the dock plugged into a PC monitor (just an old crappy 1920x1080 display with no audio) I don't have any of these issues.  Works the first time, every time.",SteamDeck

I do plug into a Sony TV and run docked,  but there is no situation where you can dock, it changed resolution to the right res, and then you undock and it changes back. This does not appear to be a scenario that was tested for. 

I encourage anyone to try any dock and see if it‚Äôs different.",SteamDeck
jhgt4as,"That's alot of problems, and most of those haven't seen other state. While I thought it was overprice to me and hat a $9-12 offers the same features for alot less was the method I went to. My case has a stand in it so that feature is always with me.

jhh36ky,Yeah same I have the same problems and have multiple docks from different companies. The official steam dock is the only one with this issue. Either there is a big quality control issue or there‚Äôs a firmware bug that needs to be addressed.,SteamDeck
jhidie1,"I'm somewhere in the middle in all of this. I've had the ""refuse to connect to HDMI"" issue three times overall. First time took me ages (and the help of another Dock my wife had to resolve). Now when it happens unpowering the Dock while connected to TV seems to sort it. 

Haven't had it in ages. 

There's definitely something askew somewhere, could be the Dock hardware, its firmware or just dodgy docks are being produced. Or it could be SteamOS or the underlying tech stack there (Linux display & resolution settings can be a nightmare but I thought we were past most of that). 

Certainly if someone asked me ""Is the official deck worth it"" I'd now say ""Not if you can find a good, cheap alternative you've researched as working well with the Deck"". It's definitely not a ""Get the official one because that just works"" scenario.",SteamDeck

jhgeu5u,This is on a game by game basis. The ideal setting is the default settings.,SteamDeck
jhgfkvi,"It'll depend on the game--if you keep lowering the GPU clock, eventually it _will_ be the bottleneck. 

The thing to keep in mind is that the relationship between power draw and clock speed is extremely nonlinear--you're saving barely anything dropping from, say, 800 MHz to 400 MHz, but those of us with overclocks will see crazy üí© like 10W for 1600 and 20W for 1750.

pulse audio is part of the sound server/tools subsystem on Linux that a lot of features rely on, it can send a sound source to a sound sink, so basically send the sound to a second system or some sort of audio output method.

if you have space on the sd card for it you can use cryoutilities to move your shader caches to the sd card (you should already have cryoutilities by now but if you dont its super simple to use)

The numbers are app ids, you can look them up on steamdb.info or if you use zshadercachekiller/cryoutilities/etc. they'll show you the game name. However the very long numbers are non-steam games. Only way to find out what they are is by snooping around in the compatdata folder and finding files with the game name.

For example, just installing Filelight adds up 1 GB of files, whereas Disk Usage Analyzer takes 300 MB only.

In the OP's case, they have installed the Rockstar Launcher, something with emulation, and the download folder is huge too. That alone is 8 GB in total, which is huge here.

About seven years ago, my family‚Äôs house burned down. I almost died. My parents and sister watched helplessly from a thousand miles away via Nest cameras as I tried to escape, not knowing if they were about to watch me burn to death. I got out just before the Internet melted and the cameras went down. Parts of the house started to collapse less than a minute later.

After a week of getting the insurance rolling and buying essentials and digging through the remains of the house for what few things with sentimental value we could find that survived at all and starting the demolition/rebuilding process, things were finally starting to slow down. We were still living out of hotels, because we hadn‚Äôt gotten into a rental house yet, so cooking wasn‚Äôt an option. We went to this Italian place by the main road because it seemed easy. Service was fine, but not fast. We had said all that there was to say already and we were all looking for distraction on our phones.

This drunk woman at the bar kept getting up from her stool to stumble over to our table and loudly lecture us on staring at our screens instead of talking to each other. She got up five or six times to do that, each lecture longer and more slurred than the last. We were all too emotionally drained to do anything but stare blankly at her. I realize that nobody at the restaurant knew what our situation was, but I still feel like the bartender or a manager or somebody should have told her to mind her own business. They didn‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt remember the food. We never went back to that restaurant. They tore it down recently. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. But I hate that woman and I still think about that night often.",SteamDeck

1. Press the Steam button
2. Select the Settings option
3. On Settings screen, select the Display option
4. On External Display Scaling, try turning off the Automatically Set Resolution toggle button by selecting it and see if you can manually change the resolution on the dropdown menu

It could be possible the game itself might be locked to certain resolutions that you can't change. For example, when I play Valkyrie Elysium, I can't change the resolution to anything other than 1280x720p even though the monitor/tv can support up to 4K and there is nothing that can be done about it without the developers enabling it through an update.",SteamDeck

6. Launch the game

jhgb8sr,"Not really, no. Long answer:

VR rendering needs to render for each eye, so you'd have to try and run things at the absolute minimum, and using 720p would give a performance hit comparable to 1440p; something the Deck can't handle unless it's an extremely simple game. That's not exact as the resolutions aren't 16:9 but it's easy to mention those as an example. VR headsets use much higher than that for clarity.

It would look extremely blurry and terrible. Add in the fact that you need high fps to avoid motion sickness (also out of what the Deck can do at high resolution) and you're way beyond feasible.

SteamVR UI and background process also have a performance impact which is negligible on a high powered PC, but the 25W APU on the Deck would probably just detonate with that on top of the game rendering lol.

I'm sorry, but it won't work.",SteamDeck

I'll summarise everything here and post links at the end. 

For my setup I have a 3D printed stand, Bluetooth keyboard and Xbox controller. To play WoW I just installed the console port addon (ill link a great tutorial video), I only tweaked the controls slightly and it works amazingly well. For those saying it doesn't look comfortable or just use a laptop.... The screen is big enough to play casually but if I need to see more I just dock it to my TV and play on the couch.... Or just play it handheld! So it's much more convenient than a laptop.

I also live in the UK, the weather here isn't usually this nice haha, and I have to admit the 3 different candle scents were maybe a bit much!

Keyboard - this isn't available but there's plenty similar ones out there:

It's of course going to be much better at windows 11 than the Deck is (and hopefully will support Secureboot), and will target modern AAA games, but both devices can coexist.

The big thing is that unlike the other companies, Asus actually owns its own fabs (Pegatron , etc), so they will actually MAKE the devices, rather than have them outsourced.  And with Best Buy as a partner and RMA center, that's going to be a big sell for them.

Just keep in mind that no matter what comes out, there's ALWAYS going to be a faster model a year or two later, so ""endgame"" simply does not exist.  This isn't like the console or 'traditional' handheld market.",SteamDeck

jhhl7bd,"The problem that I see Asus having isn't that it won't be a great device. It absolutely will be. It's probably awesome. The problem is that there isnt a good price to sell it at. No matter what they choose. 

At $699, they're basically making nothing on it. Economies of scale only go so far. Buying two million parts costs double what one million parts is. Once you're at that scale, there are no more discounts to be had. Go look at any bulk supplier. There is always a tier where buying more doesn't save you anything. At $699 they are making a bet that they are going to ship MILLIONS of units. Anything less than that will be a failure. 

But at $799 it's starting to get too expensive and most people that _would cross shop the steam deck_ are going to tap out because it's too expensive. Maybe if you're looking at the $649 model. (And I know what valve said two weeks into the sales, but since then the 64gb and 256gb have been going in and out of stock. The 512 doesn't. Which indicates that just like always, the early adopters are willing to pay more, and now that it's out, most people are choosing the cheaper models). I won't argue this, I will only repost what I just said. Because it's the only actual evidence that exists. 

$899 is the same as $799. Just with even less sales. 

At $1000, it's just too expensive and no one will buy it. Well some people will, but not enough for a company like Asus to care. They want to move _millions_ of units. They can't sell the same number of devices as Aya and be successful. They need to sell more, or they will divert the internal resources somewhere else.

How well the Asus ally does is going to be the price they sell it for. If it's over $1000, it's gunna fail hard. The steam deck performs way to well at $400 for most people to see any value in a $1000 handheld. 

_""but Aya""_ I hear you say. 

Asus is shooting for MUCH larger numbers than Aya sells. They are banking on economies of scale. If they don't sell enough to teach their threshold, it will be a failure. They're not going to sell a device for a $7 profit and be ok with only selling 20,000 of them a year. Their r&d departments have better things to do. That would be a profit of like $140k, which is a rounding error for Asus. Aya on the other hand would be fine with that. 

Asus needs to get their lowest model down to $699 before if becomes a good deal. And if all of you that claim the SD is a loss leader are right (I don't think you are) that again doesn't leave a lot of room for profit for Asus. 

Granted, Asus can leverage those economies of scale. But it's not like that is going to be _that_ much of an advantage over valve. If the numbers are to be believed and valve has shipped over a million steam decks, you don't get much more savings out of 2 million or 4 million units. You're basically at the end of bulk pricing. At some point with bulk, it is at the lowest possible and going past that won't help. 

I don't know what Asus is thinking. If it's in the price range it needs to be, there is not enough profit. If it's out of the price range, people will just buy a steam deck. 

Maybe I'm wrong. I don't doubt it will be an awesome device. Not one second. It's going to be very very cool. Especially once someone gets steam os loaded up on it. But I don't see a price range where it could be successful. No matter what number they choose, it's problematic.",SteamDeck

We don't know anything about cost or battery life, we don't know much about real world performance (except for Linus showing what sure doesn't look like 50-100% more gains in FPS vs a Deck despite claiming 50-100% better on paper performance lol.)

The only thing we can actually say with certainty about the Ally is that it lacks trackpads. Personally, that's kind of a dealbreaker for me, given how nakedly useful the trackpads are. No virtual menus? No mouse aiming in FPSes with trackpads? Basically no strategy games at all except for Halo Wars since trying to control them with sticks is like stabbing your penis with sewing needles?

jhhok4p,"Getting the parts for cheap only helps so much. Valve is probably getting most of their parts for the same price. (Relative to the part of course). Economies of scale only go so far. At some point you get to a price where the supplier can't go any lower because then they won't have any profit in it. 

That is a good point about the game pass and windows advertising. If Microsoft is subsidizing this thing, it could be a game changer. Especially if the deal is for kickbacks on sales.",SteamDeck
jhk3vtr,"See, the thing is that the fact that they say something vague like ""extremely competitive"" is an indication that it isn't. If price was a selling point, it'd be front and center in their marketing strategy from the word go.

""Twice the power for $50 more.""

""The most powerful gaming handheld on the planet, only $50 more than the equivalent Steam Deck.""  

Or even better:

""Twice the power, same price as the equivalent Deck."" 

Stuff like that. 

Yet they aren't saying anything about its price. Typically when you're marketing, you want to lead with your strongest points and downplay the weakspots. And the Ally's hype team has conspicuously downplayed the price and battery life. That to me says they know that folks are gonna balk.

jhko08m,"Sorta, but thats not really what we're talking about. We're discussing economies of scale. 

Where the more parts you buy, the better price you get them for. If you buy 16 gigabytes of ram, you pay retail, if you buy 16 exobytes of ram, you pay a lot less per gigabyte. 

But there are limits. At some point, Samsung won't give you any more discount on ram, no matter how much you buy. Because they have a cost to manufacture the part and need to make a small profit too. No company is going to sell you ram below their cost. 

So, economies of scale only go so far.

The Steamdeck, as it's intended to be used, straight up cannot play some of the most popular PC games out there. Funny how the people who keep bringing up trackpads neglect this point.

>ROG Ally isn't the first PC handeld that's supposed to competition against the deck. They all failed so far.

I'm guessing you're referring to Ayaneo and GPD? Those companies existed before the Steamdeck and are so niche in terms of availability, support and infrastructure, they can hardly be considered competitors. Asus is a completely different animal.

on a PC Trackpads and Back Buttons are must haves for me.

(that probably makes mine an unpopular opinion but that's how it is)

and doesn't the PS have a trackpad? Idk I don't play on home consoles.

I've put enough fingerprints on my Vita I know claiming it didn't have trackpads is misleading, because it had a small enough Touchscreen that it didn't need them.
and the Stylus of the DS is THE Reason I loved Tactics Games and many many other DS Games as much as I did, again that made track pads unnecessary.

imo, the handheld PCs aren't small & light enough to make using the Touchscreen viable.

Then later he got engaged to be married and it tanked when some financial things they were trying to do required him to fess up to his fiance about his past poor spending habits because it called into question the joint thing they were trying to do.

(turned out the wife wasn't very diligent about cleaning the lint trap and it got backed up inside stopping it from heating up. Spent about 30$ on a new coil that I didn't even need after taking the leaf blower to the exhaust and blowing out. Kept it just in case. 30$ was better than the hundreds for a repairman. YouTube videos helped a lot)",SteamDeck
jhbah41,Protect,SteamDeck
jha5jqb,"Yea im thinking lint could be an issue too, as it finally started working again this morning... Not sure how long that'll last. Intermittent issues are the WORST to diagnose. But the two parts some are saying could be the timer (which I think we already replaced) or one of two internal thermostats. If im lucky its the little $10 fuse or just lint build up. It really doesn't help that insurance keeps going up. It's about 230 but is going up to 265 for... Reasons? We haven't hit anything... Haven't even used roadside assistance. Their excuse is that there have been more accidents in the area. Its Root insurance...

Another issue is our car situation. The one we're paying on is an 03 yukon denali because that's all we could get approved for. The commute car is down with a blown head gasket, 03 buick century. So now I'm going to work in something that gets 12mpg. It's hard finding an affordable car that can fit 3 full carseats and all the things needed for the kids (esp the baby). Thankfully the yukon will be paid off in another 11 months. The house in 4 years? Something like that.

Really wish I could just get something like a honda super cub for going to work lol.

Have considered selling the Steam Deck. It's a 512. Between that and whatever I get from selling the buick... Dunno. There's a dealership offering cash for clunkers if I can get it there... But that means yet another car payment",SteamDeck
jhaa79r,"Had to ditch my van back a couple years after having my head gaskets replaced (close to a grand) when I took it in to get the brakes checked and the mechanic pointed out the motor mount was rotted away and barely there. Ended up getting a used 2015 Nissan leaf for a steal considering it was when used prices were surpassing new. (Dealer has no idea what they were selling and I baited them hook line and sinker) My daily driver and it has been a dream not buying gas, oil changes, typical engine failure issues. Check like auto trader often might get a good deal from someone needing to cash out.

As for the dryer, most likely lint if it's in and oot. Easy fix is pull it away from the wall and remove the exhaust pipe. Take a vacuum (preferably with a hose) and suck out anything from the machines exhaust. If you have a lint trap cleaner, this is the best time to use it. Don't have one make one. Strip of bendy plastic, cut into the edges at an angle and pull the plastic forward. Done! As for parts, Google the make/model and you can likely find any parts for way cheaper than dealer. Bought the heater coils for mine for that 30$ I mentioned, never needed but holding into it in case. Wish you luck with this and the car bro. You sound like a good person, good things will come your way. At least I like to think that is still a thing and the evil bastards haven't won.

jhfi1vc,"Short answer: It depends on you and your lifestyle. I would say do it.

Long answer: I have both a switch and a steam deck. My deck gets way more use because of everything that it can do. You wonder whether or not it‚Äôll be worth it but that‚Äôs the thing about the steam deck; it molds itself to your lifestyle. You want just a pc, it does that. You want a portable steam machine; it is that. You want to get into emulation; it does that extremely well. I think the device is near perfect and can easily fit into anything you want it to do. As far as your question about the switch games; no. You can‚Äôt transfer the games over unless you mod your switch which can be done with the help of other subreddits. If you truly want to play switch games but also want a switch, try checking out emu deck and seeing what all it can do. If you have any other questions feel free to reach out. The steam deck is one of the best purchases I have made in years and I would recommend it to everyone.",SteamDeck
jhfix30,"Definitely situational. I've thought about selling my Switch, but I also can't be arsed to set up emulation on my Deck and deal with configuring it and maintaining it. If it isn't as easy as 'pick up and play' I don't want it. Thus, I keep my Switch for times when I want to play something I can only play on a Nintendo device.

But that's me. Maybe you don't work in IT and love tinkering all day, where as I do work in IT and tinkering makes me feel like I'm still at work.",SteamDeck

jhi0qns,"I got my Switch in January, fell in love with it(and Zelda) but quickly felt underwhelmed by the types of games available there. There‚Äôs really only a handful of big mainstream titles (Witcher, Assassins Creed type games) and they run fairly poorly on the switch. It teased me in terms of handheld gaming so I decided I‚Äôd be better off with the steamdeck and recieved my one last week. It‚Äôs leaps and bounds more powerful than the switch, it has infinitely more games available on it and it‚Äôs an absolute star for tinkering and modding. Sure there‚Äôs some games that won‚Äôt run for various reasons like requiring windows(you could actually install windows if you wanted) or some games that are just too new and demanding, But the steamdeck can play the vast majority of games that exist.

So in my opinion the steamdeck is absolutely a good replacement for the switch. I wish I had researched the steamdeck in January so I could have skipped the stepping stone that the switch was.

If you like tweaking and can deal with all the jank the deck is an amazing piece of hardware, but definitely let down by the fact that it runs Linux and this is coming from a 20+ year Linux and BSD sysadmin. Gaming is nowhere near the top of my hobbies list and I only game for 4-6 hours a week on average so the more expensive games on the switch isn't really all that big of deal to me since I'm only buying 3 or 4 games a year, and as a bonus you can actually resell the cartridge and switch games hold their value very well.",SteamDeck

jhhuvdh,"1. The thing literally cannot compete in price with the Steam Deck, which is sold at a loss.

2. The thing is clearly made to 'look' cool and 'wow' people.  It will probably not perform that well.  You can also see this with the little blurbs in the leaks like ""Zero Gravity""(What the fuck does that mean?  Might as well say it has ""Blast Processing"")

3. Bare minimum controls means that there's no accessibility.  No proper trackpads for mouse controls or smooth movement, no gyros, no back buttons.  You're essentially paying more for a handheld console that WILL do less.

4. Less community support, likely less moddability or unique apps made for it.  It may have better specs, but the Steam Deck has more dedicated support from both the community and (probably) the creators.

Seriously, I don't know why people are making the Rog Ally out to be such a big deal.  Have fun paying $880(according to leaks) for a handheld that will have 1080p/120hz(and 30 minutes of battery life) that can literally only play games with controller support.",SteamDeck

What killed me was that it didn't even have the ability to jump so the movement felt like what may have been a competent shooter back in the days of the PS3, but not today. The entire game felt like a linear corridor shooter, with extremely dumb A.I., easy to cheese boss fights that are just bullet sponges, horrible weapon audio, and really bland uninspiring level design littered with invisible walls. None of that helped with the bland story that didn't catch my attention and the extremely repetitive end game.  

I really like People Can Fly, always have, so I hope they make a sequel that remedies these issues because I felt like they were almost onto something magical, but as a looter shooter, it missed the mark -at least for me.  

@OP, I am in the same boat as you. I've exhausted all the looter shooter options and am looking for that next special something to hold me over until Diablo IV.

Personally, since the SSDs are faster, more reliable, and you can use the ssd that was in your deck elsewhere, it seems like a no-brainer over microSD cards.

After the deal was signed, and the manufacturer was locked in legally,Walmart kept wanting lower cost. Made them pick lower quality metal, cheaper wheels, cheaper motor, etc. The manufacturer was stuck, and couldn't escape. By the end, their products were crap, and everyone blamed them.

I don't particularly like Linux for a desktop experience. I like the idea and concept behind it but using it leaves me baffled. However in the Steam Decks case, I think Valve has chosen the right option for a gaming device.  


Valve has gave people the option to install Windows onto the device, but if they are not willing to install this due to ""not wanting to waste time"". Windows is not the option in this case.",SteamDeck
jh5x6yc,"Then either figure out how to install windows or stop complaining about a product that wasn't advertised to play those games not being able to play those games.  

Also fyi, Destiny runs 25-30 fps on the deck so not worth it anyway imo.  And if you want some help with windows there are plenty of people who'd be willing to help over dms / discord or something.  You message me and provided you aren't a dick I will gladly help you over discord.

The current model means they can just put out a Windows game and Valves proton compatibility works well enough that there's a very good chance that the game will just be verified because it works well. Getting this verification requires zero commitment from the developer to ensure that it keeps working or even that it works at all in the first place.

jh6utm9,">	How are they perks?

‚Ä¶are you serious? How are mods, backwards compatibility, and free multiplayer *not* perks? They‚Äôre very clearly reasons to choose pc over other platforms.

And no, they‚Äôre not historically specific to pc. In the past there have been consoles with backwards compatibility (current Xbox/PlayStation), free multiplayer (most consoles before 360 era, PS3, etc), and mods (very limited, but Skyrim on current gen consoles).

PC has had these throughout all the console generations but the point remains - these are reasons to get a pc just as they were reasons to get the consoles that shared these perks. 

For example, the PS3 had free multiplayer. This was a point to get it over the 360. But they still competed for the same demographic - free multiplayer didn‚Äôt magically give it an entirely separate user base.

>	One of the primary reasons that people give for choosing a console over PC is convenience

Exactly, this is a perk of getting a console. Just as what you listed earlier are the perks of getting a pc. Both have their advantages, and those of us that enjoy video games will have to choose which we prefer.",SteamDeck
jh84rar,"That is literally impossible they cannot force them to do anything because the developers never asked for the verification in the first place.

jhe6jre,"The primary thing that you need to understand is that emulators are *console*-specific, not *game*-specific. You can think of an emulator as being a game console made of software.

So for example, ""can I play [x, y, and z] PS1 games?"" is too specific of a question. What you should be asking is just ""Can I run a PS1 emulator?""

This becomes more muddled as you move on to newer, more powerful consoles, where emulator compatability and performance requirements vary, but for consoles as old as the PS1 and the Genesis, it's pretty much just ""if you can run anything, then you can run almost everything.""

Check out EmuDeck, they do a good job of making emulation fairly idiot-proof for beginners. If you get stuck, then remember, think ""console,"" not ""game."" Don't look up ""How to set up Croc on Steam Deck."" Look up ""How to emulate PS1 on Steam Deck.""

The first huge hang up with the Sticks on the Deck is that by default the Deck is shipped with a GIANT 30% Deadzone, 
everybody needs to reduce that to like 10% for the sticks to not feel garbage.  

You want to read this guide i've written, the UI got updated a bit since then but the options are still all there:  
https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w2gos4/psa_optimize_your_deadzones/  

You can NOT add auto aim if the developer of a game did not add it to the PC port, which a lot of older Xbox ports did not bother with.  
I don't know about COD4 but if you say it has no native gamepad support then you can probably forget about auto aim there.  

But you can absolutely make any game with mouse feel right. You just need to really dig into the Steam Input menu so you understand what you are doing with all the buttons in there.  
You can also add Gyro Aim, just enable it while you hold down the left trigger so you can use it like ADS instead of it always being on.  

...and in my experience most of the community made profiles are good as a start off point, but i absolutely customize that stuff myself every single time because nobody every does it the way where i'd be happy with it.  

The amount of settings is a bit intimidating at first... take an afternoon, wrap your head around all the Steam Input settings, once you know how it all works and what it does its much less scary and you go straight to the settings that you know you want to change next time.",SteamDeck

To play them on a purly gamepad focused device was impossible until now. :) Because their movement is mouse based for turn and forward and backward, but then you'd need to right click to stop moving, and at the same time you need extreme precision for menuing in dialog menues.

So after I started to set up analog controls with reverse outer zone for joysticks as mouse emulation, and the touchpad for precision mousing, and then put in an autofiring mouse rightclick once the stick reaches the inner zone (inverted outer zone), and then set auto fire interval to max, but then noticed, that the two rightclicks are stil too close together, because double rightclick kicks you out of walking mode, so then I hacked in an alternating command to the rightlclick of inverse outerzone, that does nothing, so I could stretch the autofire interval beyond the built in max --- and then it, just worked.

And then I finetuned delays, and it suddenly felt good. And then I wanted magnification for some ingame scenes, and mapped it to a backbutton within 10 seconds.

And then I was playing the game, and everything felt great.

jhcmtte,"u/VincibleAndy for the easy fix. 

For those for whom this game worked and then the recent update to Proton broke it, its due to needing to have EA launcher reinstalled. Uninstalling the game doesnt do that right away, as it keeps the user files for the game for a while after.

To fully reset it you just need to delete the folder that stores all of the ""install"" files from the game.

ME - Legendary Edition is stored under 1328670. You can just delete that folder and then run the game with Proton Experimental and it will do a new install of EA launcher and you are good to go.

home/.local/share/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1328670/

 That is also the location of your saves if you want to back those up, even though they should be going to the EA cloud.

There are a few games (like the citadel) that have some sort of weird turn acceleration though where flickstick doesn't work right though.",SteamDeck
jhc3uuv,"og Steam Controller power user here. More tips:

* Make sure your Rotation setting is dialed in for your trackpad ""as mouse""!!! Cannot be stressed enough; it rotates the tracking grid in software to line it up with the natural angle your thumb swipes along. This helps DRASTICALLY reduce unintentional vertical ""drift"" from the trackpad
* Set your trackpad as mouse sensitivity to be high. Most Steam Controller users like 180 degrees of camera rotation on a full horizontal swipe. I go even higher. Double that, in fact. 360/swipe. This is so its 180 on a half swipe either direction, which imo makes for better ""fast turning""/""target acquisition"".
* (optional, pending above) Reduce the Sensitivity Vertical Scale by some amount. Since most games lock the camera vertical rotation to some point (in fps' looking straight up to straight down is common), a good plan is for a full vertical swipe to take you from one limit to the other limit. Less (not making it all the way on a full swipe) is fine, hypothetically more (reaching from one limit to the other in less than a full swipe) is a waste. Also; reducing this slider will further help reduce vertical ""drift"" from the trackpad.
* (optional, if using trackball emulation) Set Friction Vertical Scale to 0. I cant recall if the new ui has the description, but if it does this slider actually behaves opposite to the description. 0 kills any vertical spin from the trackball emulation, which serves to eliminate any vertical ""drift"" from the emulated trackball.

Basically, you want the trackpad to be a ""fast turn""/""target acquisition"" input and then do your aiming with the gyro.

I havent played Amid Evil (yet), but this is how I play Ultrakill with the Steam Controller. Been working on getting P-Ranks on violent difficulty, and finding decent success.",SteamDeck
jh8l8qr,"Might be hard to tell from just watching the footage, but I find it much easier to aim with ""Trackpad as Mouse"" vs. using the Right Joystick (even after hours of practicing and tweaking settings, see deadzone reduction values in the video). My [Trackpad + Gyro config](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12csshb/comment/jf2y5wy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is still my preferred layout, but I can still have fun playing trackpad-only if I can't use the gyro for some reason. If you're struggling with shooter controls, a similar config might work for you, just give yourself time to get used to it!

jh9wg7h,"I had this experience with some games, it could be latency creeping in. When it happened with Deadlink, a simple restart fixed it. I heard using the Deck's framerate limiter can cause lag, and that it's better to use an in-game option if available. I'm pretty sure I had this issue with Black Mesa (don't remember, I'll have to retest).

Mixed input can also mess up in subtle ways, so you might have to go full keyboard/mouse bindings (restart the game after you do that). Hope you can solve those issues.",SteamDeck
jh9u7md,"Yeah, what's nice is whether you aim with a stick or pad, you can always use the other as a menu :) I remember not liking using the pad to aim when I first tried them as well.

jhaelvl,"Yeah, I think enabling gyro (with either stick or trackpad) is best for quick accuracy. However, some people can't use gyro due to disabilities, tremors, etc. so I just wanted to share how gyro-less trackpad is also a viable alternative that can actually work better than gyro-less stick.

jh93e6b,"I find it interesting how different opinions are on this. Personally, I absolutely can't stand gyro *not* being on all the time. I use it so much also for just looking around, too, probably more often than the right stick in that case.

-  It's not a term I came up with.

- Like ""roguelites"" it's become a genre in its own right.
- Many devs themselves have embraced the term. This game was part of a bundle literally called the [Boomer Shooter Bundle](https://www.pcgamer.com/humbles-boomer-shooter-bundle-is-one-of-the-best-fps-collections-ive-seen/)

jhbh6i0,"you can use 

exfat or
ntfs or
ext4 as file systems on the usb stick.

(exfat preferably, as both MacOS and linux have no problems reading it.)

apfs = APPLE File System (ring a bell?)

Also, I would not do it that way. Because when MacOS copies files to external storage media it ads a bunch of metadata files (files with ._ in front of them) to the storage medium, that macos uses but that can not be stored on other file systems ""as part of the actual file"".

So now you run into the problem that when you tranfer them over, you actually have double the amounts of files, half of which are useless on a linux system.

I'd use samba or sftp for example:
https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#how-do-i-transfer-files-to-my-steam-deck - because when transfering using those, no additional metadata files get created by MacOS.

Or because I'm lazy, I use a windows virtual machine on MacOS (using parallels) (could also be a linux one), to copy files to external media, so I dont get those metadata files (._filename.txt).

There are also cleaners for those metadata files (some in script form, others simple Programs on MacOS), but that would be an extra step and I'm lazy.

It's mainly an issue of performance and battery for me. It can run all the things, but generally not as good, and for not as long. When a game can run on both Windows and SteamOS, running it on Windows is often the worse option.

If it's your only option for a game though, oh well. Windows it is.

> What‚Äôs the benefit of pitting people against Windows? Sounds like a L for everyone if you do that.

There's a lot to unpack with this question. But in short, Windows sucks, and in the places it shines best, Others are catching up.

> How do we advocate robbing Nintendo but draw the line at using another OS?

Don't get it twisted, if you're installing windows by all means go ahead and ""rob"" M$,   

Windows just isn't very valuable outside of some programs and ""Muh Games.""

Step 2: Acquire your ROMs and PS3 bios files. Nobody here can tell you where to get these, because it's piracy.

Step 3: Once you have your bios files and roms, put your files in the relevant folders. For bios files that's emulation -> bios (you can just dump the bios files there loose, no need to put them in their own folder or anything). For roms that's emulation -> roms -> ps3.

Step 4: Run the emudeck installer again, select tools, select steam rom manager.

Step 5: Select preview up in the corner of SRM.

Step 6: Select parse down on the bottom of SRM.

Step 7: Select save. (You can also deselect roms/emulators you don't want added to steam before you hit save if you want.)

Step 8: Go back to gaming mode.

Step 9: Launch RPCS3.

Edit: Here's where it gets a little tricky. I wasn't aware of this since it's been awhile since I did PS3 emulation, I was getting thrown off by my much greater experience with PS2 emulation lol. 

Step 10. From within RPCS3, go to file -> install firmware, and navigate to the firmware file you downloaded (should be in a .pup format).

Step 11. Still from within RPCS3, go to file -> install packages/raps/edats. You'll want to use this function to install the rom's files. Should be a .pkg and a .rap file.

The Steam Deck is amazing for gaming on the go, but it is targeted at a particular audience, and you should evaluate if you belong to that audience.

At your age I remember gaming for hours in my gaming pc, there was no Steam Deck back then but there were other portable devices which I owned, and I never gave more playtime to those devices compared to the hundreds of hours I spent on my PC.

If you have a particular need to be constantly on the go and not able to game in your house, then the Steam Deck is definitely the answer, I‚Äôd say 90% of the people who own a Steam Deck use it on their work commute, while they are deployed, on the bed with their SO, because they have to take care of their kids or something similar but I can‚Äôt see how a 14 yo would have any of those problems and if that‚Äôs the case id strongly advise you to focus on upgrading your current PC, grow your steam library bigger and when those problems arise and you have so little time for yourself that you need to game on the go in order to even be able to continue gaming, then there will be a new Steam Deck version with better hardware that you will be able to buy.

jhaxp6l,Delete Proton files,SteamDeck
jhay528,"When switching proton compatibility layers, sometimes, but not always (its actually kind of rare) a compatdata folder can corrupt.

Compatdata folder = prefix folder (just another way of saying it)

What the compatdata folder is, is the fake windows install folder that gets created per game.

But because its the Fake windows install folder, the save files are also in there.

So find out how to backup your save files from there (cloud backup is one thing, but when you have hundreds of hours in a game you batter make sure you have them in your hands...). Then delete compatdata folder.

Then install again.

The thing for you to know is that sometimes switching proton versions will corrupt the fake windows install folder.

I'm not giving you folderpaths, because depending on what you used to install the game, they are different.

compatdata folder location is the search term for steam installs of the game

prefix folder location for lutris or heroic installs.

Also make sure that you have enabled ""show hidden files and folders in the linux file explorer"".

Also zshadercachekiller can nuke the compatdata folder, but first, make sure you got your saves.",SteamDeck

/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/THENNUMBEREDFOLDER (one compatfolder per game)

Game files folder:
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/THENNAMEDFOLDER


Game files folder can also be in a steamapps folder on you sdcard, if you installed the game on sdcard. Compatdata usually will always be in that place on the ssd, except if you used non official tools to move it.

/home/deck/

sometimes is /home/ only

so the way that that works is, that the folder path on the ssd is always /home/deck/

but if you click on home in the linux file explorer, you will be brought to home of the logged in user alredy, which is the user deck.

So you are in /home/deck/ already with no indication that you are.

Cap the frames, drop the quality settings in game, render at a lower resolution, limit TDP, etc. By far, the CPU and GPU consume the most power, so the less those are utilized, the longer the battery will last.

If you have a good internet connection and have a gaming PC or console you can remote play from or a subscription like Game Pass Ultimate or GeForce Now, streaming your games will use significantly less power, and you won't have to sacrifice quality or frame rates either.

Also I would suggest turning on ""allow tearing"" since it should get rid of any input delay coming from the capped framerate. Also make sure to *NOT* use vsync or framerate caps that are *in game* if possible.

Second way might affect your game some more and require some testing and tweaking, and that's limiting how much power your game is allowed to use by using the TDP limit function. If you're playing lighter games, you can tell it to limit it down to the lowest value you can go that won't have much of an effect, but it's going to differ from game to game.

I remember buying NOLF 1 and playing it on my PC all those years ago, so might give it a go for the nostalgia.

I installed it into an external hard drive on Windows, then connected the drive to my deck, booted into desktop mode, copied over the NOLF folder, added as a non steam game, forced proton GE, and it launched fine.

jhcked1,May I ask how you got the second one running?,SteamDeck
jh8c64l,"Maybe you clicked ""open"" in your browser when downloading the exe? Or you double clicked it after it finished downloading? It sounds like you might be trying to run the exe without adding it as a non steam game to Steam. There's a little work we need to do to get a Windows exe running under Linux.

In Steam (desktop mode) you want to click the Games menu then click Add a Non Steam Game to my library. Click Browse and find the installer exe, probably in your Downloads folder unless you picked somewhere else to put it.

The other thing you need to do for this step is  tell Steam to use Proton, which can translate some Windows-specific code to code SteamOS can use. Right click on your new shortcut (should be the name of the exe right now) and choose properties. Under Compatibility, click the drop down and choose Proton 8 (I think it's Proton 8.0-1 right now).

You can change the shortcut name from inside the Properties window (Step 4). Then follow step 5 either by downloading the controller template I provided or by choosing the base ""keyboard and mouse"" controller configuration (which you can then edit later). 

Once you've done all this you can run the installer by clicking the Steam Shortcut's play button (Step 6).",SteamDeck

jhb9t8g,"Many people consider using a keyboard and mouse in Halo Infinite to be a distinct disadvantage, since the auto aim in that game is so strong when using a controller",SteamDeck
jhcl0p5,"MCC is still buggy. Campaign coop only works between two steam decks, the game crashes after a multiplayer match, etc. 343i has those listed as known, so they're going to be addressed at some point. Singe player experience is superb so I've got hope for that game's future on deck.

Infinite honestly varies between updates. I played most of Season 2 through my Steam Deck with no issues. Season 3 has introduced more crashes for me. Call me crazy, but I imagine they'll be addressed too.

So... yeah right now isn't exactly great. It's not unplayable, but it's inconsistent. I'd still consider it at least worth keeping an eye on both games though. My experiences with Infinite season 2 and MCC's campaigns were solid enough that I'm still here recommending these games to people.

Edit: Just to get an idea of what it's like, I grabbed my Deck and played a game of Fiesta. The Deck crashed a bunch for about 10 minutes and then I got into my game. Locked 60FPS with no hitches during gameplay despite every player at one point running around with a rocket launcher.",SteamDeck
jhci8i2,"Agreed, it is absolutely a disadvantage in the MCC due to how all 5 multiplayer games are designed around a strong aim assist system.

jhaoyyi,"To be honest I don‚Äôt think you can.  Every time you add a new non-steam game it gets assigned a new autogenerated gameID number.  If steam can‚Äôt find an existing prefix with that ID it assumes it‚Äôs a new install and creates a new prefix for you.  I suppose in theory you could try renaming the old prefix folder to have the new gameID number, but I would kinda expect that would break things quite badly.

To ‚Äùfix‚Äù this, and to avoid similar issues for gog games in the future I would suggest ditching gog galaxy and using the heroic games launcher instead.  It‚Äôs an unofficial linux games launcher for the GOG/Epic games stores.  You can install it from the discover app in desktop mode.  You can then use another application called boilr ( also installable in discover ) to create shortcuts in steam for the gog game prefixes managed by heroic.  Because steam sees these as linux shortcuts (  eg// run com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl heroic://launch/123456 ) it does not try to create any new prefixes for them, so you can add/remove the shortcuts at will.

If you do decide to take this route, just make sure to backup any saves you may have before deleting the old prefix.",SteamDeck
jhay9cv,"Deleting the link is what killed it.

What you need to do is the following:

Take your installer, add it as a non steam game. Run it with some proton version. This will install the game.

Then you go to the ""non-steam game"" you added and change its target from the setup/installer exe to the game exe that you installed, via the 'properties' menu of the game in steam in desktop mode. You'll need protontricks to easily find the right prefix with the game exe, or you can do it manually.

This way it all stays in one prefix, nice and accessible.

I'm not 100% sure how well gog galaxy will work with this, but in theory you should do it the same way. Add galaxy installer as a non-steam game. Install it, then change the non-steam game's target from the galaxy installer to the galaxy exe.

Alternatively, you can use heroic or lutris to get gog games, or bottles to install gog galaxy.",SteamDeck
jhb9fk0,the launch parameter STEAM\_COMPAT\_DATA\_PATH fixes that. see other comment.,SteamDeck
jhb5oto,"Thank you :)

I got it running!

All in desktop mode:

A) Install GOG Galaxy

A.1) Download and add GoG Galaixe installer to steam and choose a recent proton version

A.2) Execute and Install GOG Galaixe & when done install your game

B) Add the games executable as game

B.1) Go to your games install location, select the exe and choose ""add to steam""

B.2) In steam, select your newly added game, goto options

B.3) go to Shortcut-LaunchOptions and enter:`STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=""/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/<game-app-id>"" %command%`

The game-app-id is generic and you need to find out your local one by looking into the parent directory of the path.

This option enables your link to be used within anothers proton directories (e.g. from the gog install)

B.4) Enable a recent proton version (""compatibility"")

C) Launch your game in gaming mode! Respect the Controler Settings as steam probably selects the wrong template and nothing works.

Lets just say I helped 10.000s of people on the internet, on some projects longterm, I got nothing in return for it - and then I started to be a partly a dick about it.

Because I started to understand, that the people who were valuable to me in any sense - are not the people out there with a ""help me longterm"" attitude. :)

Its mostly the people that have stoped replying to low efforts posting entirely.

And thats in every field I entered. (Some without prior experience.)

So be nice to people who are new to a scene? Sure. I get the sentiment, and the concept behind it.

Always be on your best ""customer is always right and I should have been polite"" behavior, when you even would have to fake it?

No chance. In H-E-doublehockeysticks.

Low effort postings are a thing. Let me farm out ""project I want done"" to the internet is a thing. Abusive attitudes in people who always think, they can just request services, or quality answers without ever reaching the ability to giving anything back on their own - is a thing.

As in thats the normal outcome.

Because of one simple apect.

Social reciprocity breaks on the internet, because people dont know each other as small nit communities, so no one remembers the next persons face, or name and everyone just treats the next person in a ""free to exploit manner"".

So now enter online communities, set up to give you entirely made up point rankings, to give you dopain rushes, to do that stuff for free. Companies moving product support out to ""support communites"" using unpaid labor, and entire companies, that only build structures, for people to provide content in, and sells ads against it... Those business models exist. In practice and on paper (business plans).

And you might start to understand, why sometimes, I choose to be a dick...

Because what I'm handing out is not for sale. Its not a service a company or anyone could pay for. Because I do it for one motivation only and that is knowing that other people will learn stuff and then be able to teach others -- which btw. doesnt happen often, but for the few cases it does - doing so is worth it.

Oh and ""dont worry, if you dont feel like it, someone else will answer that question, because everyone is out there and sharing"" is a highly idealized concept, that mostly holds true for three months after early adopters get their hands on a thing, and the community is still growing.",SteamDeck

He makes A LOT of valid points.",SteamDeck
jhbsuov,"Actually no.

Its about sustained output. Of as many informed people as possible, over time.

So, you are correct, getting something in return on an individual level is something you can forget entirely, when dealing in those settings with the public at large. :)

What I'm describing as ""everyone is just out there to exploit the best person for their needs from their perspective"" is just normal behavior. I'm only mentioning it, because ""best person for their needs"" is not an unlimited resource, and allocation far more challenging than ""the universe will make it happen semi perfectly, there is karma"".

As in there is a point where quality of information usually plummets once information based communities leave their growing phase.

So there are two outcomes, either you see that the exploitation factor is high and you stop entirely. Or you ignore it for the benefit of people that might still learn and grow.

And then there is the position of someone looking and this starting to question how they could make the information flow better here, and coming to the conclusion, that if they reduce ""misuse"" (by scolding low effort questions, sometimes (overdoing is a problem)), they can keep the people actually willing to share higher quality information in the loop for longer, benefiting everyone.

Because to not see the exploitation, and the people burning out because of it, or just leaving, is simply not possible. You can ignore it. Or you can try to minimize it.

Also the tendency to overdo it is there - so what you do (balancing that) is valuable as well.

The point where I still have a conceptual problem is -- how do deal with information communities that jumped the shark entirely - so those that start to disseminate wrong information because the ""whats best"" and ""ego"" and ""most easy crowd"" took over. :)

There the right decision often is ""just leave them be"" - and I still find it very hard to do. As in I kind of cant. So when (personally perceived as) wrong recommendations get put out there, I still have the inclination to double my efforts.

Where you are right is, that if you want to elongate the growth phase of an information community - you'd do what you and every PR person in the world is promoting.

Just never pronounce anything to be anything other, than everyone is valuable to us, and we are friendly and welcoming, from whatever vantage point you want to shout it into the public.

Also ""spiraled"", and contemplated those aspects almost philosophically  are still two different things.

And actually, the more I think about it, the less I actually value the ""mass growth"" aspect of any information economy community concept.

Let the people grow who actually are interested and show promise. I'm not doing this for the lowest common denominator. (Youtuber popularity, or what someone can then put into a ""whats best way to"" posting, when reiterating part of it).

There is no strategy with cover or terrain and the bubble color coded attack weakness gimmick feels like a ps2 game mechanic.

Visually the environments are all just ok. They definitely spent 90% of their resources on the castle and hogsmead and I really think they succeeded into making those areas come to life and feel fun to explore. But if you‚Äôre not a huge fan of the movies, the charm and mystique of hog warts wear off after a few in game hours.

That said my deck is undervolted with a slight bump on the CPU to 3.7ghz instead of 3.5.

I generally go for battery life so I underclocked the GPU and limited the TDP.

I can't go nearly as far as him with undervolting so I max out at -25mv but it seems to make a huge difference. Similar to him in that it gets around 3 hours if not a bit more of battery life and runs perfectly at 30fps for the most part.

A slight bump in CPU frequency seems to help a lot, however going much higher makes it use a lot more power and get very very hot.

I do worry about people bricking their deck though, you have to be so careful going up in 5mv increments and testing for instability first. I could also never get the CPU up to 4Ghz, I tried for Warzone in Windows and even with fanspeed at 100% and GPU usage super low and underclocked it would be pushing 100C as for some reason the CPU seems to heat up way more than the GPU, something to do with the chip layout I imagine!",SteamDeck

don't tell me you really think an SSD is faster than Ram. its not even comparable. pushing ram to the disk is MUCH slower and only meant to be used when your ram is limited which is not the case for the steam deck nor would it ever improve performance its just a crutch that sacrifices performance for pseudo ram. turning down swappiness is what improves performance because it GREATLY reduces the usage of the swap file to almost nothing",SteamDeck

* For streaming-heavy games evicting too much file backed pages might actually cause rising IO pressure depending on how the game is designed.
* LRU might be able to relieve some of the problems regarding to swapping out hot pages. It's not perfect but it's also not always ""we have to keep everything in memory"".

LMAO wrong. Swappiness decides how much anonymous pages (simply put: process memory) can be swapped out compare to file pages (opened files) when memory pressure rises, and the default is 50-50. There's also some algorithm in place to avoid hot pages so there's better chance that it would swap out pages that don't matter immediately to the game.

Keep in mind that stutters can still occur when the kernel tries harder to figure out what pages can be reclaimed when there's less viable candidates for it to work with, and that throw away hot file pages can sometimes cause problems too when e.g. the game streams heavily.",SteamDeck

I've tested both on disk swap as well as zram (which for those that don't know is a much faster swap block in the ram itself) and on disk swap either provides no difference or hurts performance while zram makes no change at all regardless if 1 swappiness or 200 swappiness because it isn't harmed by that like on disk swap is

I've also tested every vram setting and games will use the same amount of vram regardless of the setting and get the same performance. the issue starts when you start to starve the CPU as in the case of Red Dead Redemption 2 but otherwise the only difference is 256MB gives the system more ram to work with overall.",SteamDeck

jhajzre,"Destiny is out of the question with it being a live service game and I'm pretty sure it doesn't even work on deck without a duel boot windows operating system due to bungie's anti cheat.

I don't know enough about VR to comment on gorilla tag but I can imagine modding in VR is exponentially more difficult compared to standard games.

Portal does actually have a modding community which would be worth looking into, but I don't follow it enough myself. 

Same with Roblox. I don't know enough about it as I've never played it myself, as I understand it has a built in engine for altering and creating your own games so this could be a nice place to start depending on the difficulty.

Minecraft is something I've modded myself in detail so I'd definitely give this a go. There's launchers such as the GL launcher that runs natively on Linux on the steam deck and is downloaded through the discovery store in desktop mode. It's really easy adding  mods to create the sort of gameplay you're interested in from scratch or by taking someone else's premade pack and adding bits.",SteamDeck

jhaj26m,"Not that I have tried offline mode for Ubisoft Connect on the Steam Deck, but on PC this is not correct. There is an [offline play mode](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/running-ubisoft-connect-pc-in-offline-mode/000063188). This is the same kind of check that Steam has, which requires you to run the game at least once while connected, before being able to play the game in offline mode. The difference I have noticed, is the game might ctd if you lose connection mid-game on Ubisoft Connect, where a game in Steam will continue to work.

Most of the most current games require always online-play for all functionality, but a lot of the older SP-focused titles (like _Odyssey_) should be available offline. Generally these are SP-focused or SP-only titles originally released on uPlay prior to the switch to Ubisoft Connect and the launch of Ubisoft Plus.

I have played most of the Ubisoft games I own in offline mode on my desktop PC, including _Assassin's Creed Odyssey_. The only game I had an issue with not playing was _FarCry 6_ trial, as it wouldn't work in-game if it couldn't connect to Ubisoft Connect, despite being verified and activated prior to launch.",SteamDeck

It's interesting that those are the games that work offline now.",SteamDeck
jhejj2c,"uPlay had the same thing, but you had to sign in online first and it would ""provision"" offline play for a bit. I believe Steam requires online sign-in every 30 days (?), but it feels like Ubisoft Connect is much, much shorter. 

The biggest issue with the Ubisoft app and provisioning/authentication (and why we see a lot of ""can't you actually remember me?"" type post), is that it ties your authentication to your computer _and_ your location (IP address). If you have a dynamic IP, use a VPN, or go somewhere else and login, it immediately de-authorizes all other logged in states, forcing you to login and ""remember my pc"" next time you are home, online, VPN, etc.",SteamDeck

Sometimes solutions are succinct, some are also viable alternatives, but some overcomplicate as much as they fix.  The good ones do stand out and get more word of mouth praise.

But you'll rely on these community projects to a fault and tolerate a likely possibility of unexpected incompatibility because the immense scope tackled by multiple asynchronized  pieces.  Also free, so beggars can't be choosers. But that could be said of any immature OS.  There is less opporunity to sit on an older static OS version with automatic updates on restart.

\- Sticks are too slippery, and too stiff, not precise enough for tiny camera movement, also the fact that they passed Q&A with all the click/crunch and other noise issue because of the sensor cable inside is baffling me.

\- The D pad is meh at best.

\- Back button are too hard to press if you don't put something on it to make them bigger

\- The keyboard is a pain to use, slow, sluggish, same goes for the touch screen.

\- The OS still need some polish, I don't know if it's because of my large steam library but it lag very often.

Also it loses like, 20% a day while on standby, despite not doing anything in standby? I don't quite get that one, certainly needs to be addressed. If my iPad only loses 1% in standby while constantly flicking on for twitch and email notifications (which it has to stay connected to internet to do as well), then my steamdeck shouldn't be losing 20% while waiting for me to press the power button and doing nothing in the background.

jh2dghq,"The software and hardware (which includes the chassis and controller), don't seem completely polished yet. The operating system lacks stability when compared to a console and the physical appearance of the device isn't entirely cohesive. However, I knew what I was getting into before purchasing, so I have no complaints. On the other hand, it has exceeded my expectations in some areas.

I know that Valve is constantly improving the software, which is a major plus. Nevertheless, I hope that the Steam Deck 2 will be constructed with better attention to detail. It may sound like I'm being overly critical, but its really not that bad as it sounds. There are just a few minor issues that I've noticed: The trigger spring sometimes makes a sound, while the joysticks feel sticky and produce a slight noise at the center. Additionally, the casing tends to crackle a bit when pressure is applied in certain directions. Although this isn't a major issue, it's something that most devices with plastic casings of this size would likely experience.

Overall, I still adore the device despite its minor flaws. If Valve can rectify most of the software problems and introduce some crucial quality of life improvements, the Steam Deck will be nearly perfect.",SteamDeck

jh35xll,"How dare you attempt to limit me to only one complaint about the Deck!

Here's my 'Whine List':

* **OSK.** Still kinda sucks really. It's a LOT more tolerable now we got the few changes Valve made to improve it, but it's still got a long way to go before it could ever be as good to use as something like a phone touchscreen on Android. For a start it's often too slow, and the lack of any kind of predictive text makes it feel very clunky. I mean, I know enough about how this all works to know that I definitely don't blame Valve for the lack of predictive text, obviously that's not possible when using the keyboard in games for example, but it's still annoying.
* **Battery life.** The battery life is excellent for what the Deck does. But just because it's excellent, doesn't mean I can't still complain about it! Because while it's excellent, my internal spoiled brat is stomping her foot on the floor and saying, 'But why can't I have 20 hours straight battery life while playing GTA V!'.
* **Laggy UI Issues.** Particularly on the 'Collections' screen. It's obvious the UI is generating the thumbnails for each collection from scratch each time and not caching them. The result is about a 1 second long frame drop for me as it attempts to generate thumbnails for a dozen collections and a few hundred games.
* **No 'Screen Off' Button.** We have an off button. I want a 'screen off' button. Keeps games running, keeps the whole Deck running, just turns off the screen and mutes the audio. I don't know how this could possibly work in a way which won't be confusing to users and result in a bunch of misuse and battery life disasters, but it's still something I want, because I want to be able to turn off the Deck's screen when I need to leave it somewhere downloading a game for 30 minutes, it just feels wrong leaving the screen unchanging showing a progress bar for 30 minutes, like it's going to cause screen burnin or something.

Understandably the biggest complaint I might have for the Deck however is just the general 'bugginess' of the whole software stack. It's becoming less a Deck specific issue and more just a general familiar level of bugginess that Valve has in a lot of their software. They make incredible things which I love but they often get things about '90% stable' and seem to start working on the next incredible thing and forget to polish the experience of what they already made.

But no that's not my biggest complaint.

Nor is my biggest complaint just the manner in which Valve just seems very inconsistent and low-attention-span in their management. Like for example, in the first launch months of the Deck, they started doing monthly update videos. We got one each month for the first 2 months, then another at the 4 month mark then nothing for a long time, then one at the 12 month mark. It's like someone said 'We should do monthly update videos', then they got to the 4 month mark and said 'Nah this is boring'.

But no that's not my biggest complaint either.

My biggest complaint is... This is my favourite gaming device of all time and I can't spend 24/7 on it because I have to sleep, eat and work for most hours of each day. :(",SteamDeck

Controller Support, at least with playable, not verified, games.  It's a nuisance but not a deal breaker but sucks how older games are like 'press [button1], press [mouse1], press [E]' and you basically need to memorize your controller mapping, worse is when the game doesn't support mapping of all functions in the game unlike the game's console side version, but that's a nitpick.

Battery Life, which is fixed with a portable battery, buy a third party deck clip + battery to attach it to, boom, 8 hour battery life, plus I don't mind the weight.  But standalone, that battery life defeats the portable idea.

Incompatibility issues with more modern 'service' games.  I'm talking about Ubisoft connect, anti-cheat, game launchers being required.  Standard steam deck needs a good deal of work arounds for some games.

It's only a problem for games that don't require the second joystick, which is probably why it wasn't addressed. If I have to twin stick anything, I'm not hitting them as much. But in retro games or 2D games in general, I feel like the buttons could be improved some.",SteamDeck

This place is a good resource but it is frustrating at times.,SteamDeck
jh141v0,"The dock/undock experience. It's such a pain in the ass. Sometimes it just works and it's magic, but more often I'll put the Deck in the dock and the Deck's screen will go dark but the monitor won't wake up. Or the monitor will wake up and just display a black screen. I unplug the dock to try again and the Deck stays dark for like 5-10 seconds, so I have to wait. Then it lights up and I plug it back in. Sometimes it'll work the second try, sometimes it'll do the same shit, sometimes it will connect and work...but at the wrong resolution or refresh rate.

SteamOS doesn't seem to remember the settings you assigned to each monitor, either. It does in Desktop mode, but in Game mode I seemingly have to set my monitor to the right settings every time. This is a huge pain in the ass because one of my monitors is 1440p 165hz, but the deck can only do 1440p 120hz...but it STILL TRIES 165hz and gets stuck at a black screen. I have to go in and turn on monitor safe mode, then connect the monitor, then set it to 1440p 120hz, then it's fine. Until the next time I connect it, I have to do the same shit again.

I know we're all tired of Switch comparisons but I can jackhammer the Switch into and out of the dock rapid fire and it connects and displays instantly, it switches back to the device screen instantly. Over and over, 100% reliably, it just works every time. Plus Switch games can have different performance profiles for docked and undocked and again, swap between them instantly every time. Audio also always goes to the right place without having to make sure ""External Device"" is selected, because seemingly at random my Deck will decide to use its own speakers instead.

And this isn't limited to one dock or monitor, I've tried it with a bunch of different monitors and a bunch of different TVs. I've used just plain usb-c to hdmi/displayport cables, I've used fancy docks, I've used cheap ones, I own the *official dock*, and they all run into the same bullshit.

This also glosses over issues with screen aspect and scaling. I've pretty much given up on smoothly using my Deck in the same way I use my Switch. Whenever I think about docking it I just remember how much of a pain it is and don't bother. I really hope this improves.",SteamDeck
jh142az,"Launchers are the worst.

The second worst thing is that someone dropped mine or sat on it or something and it's got a little crack in the front chassis which isn't worth the effort fixing it would take but I know it's there and it bothers me a tiny bit.

Also the newer ones, as we have two in my house, are a bit better build quality.

2) most modern game are not optimized for 720p(800p even more so). Frequently you get terrible aliasing, and no antialiasing can save you. Also the games are making more computation than needed at that resolution, resulting in hot AF system with terrible performance. 
1) one nvme 2230 slot is not enough. Would be nice to have at least 2280. Even better 2280 + 2.5

And yeah, I realise it will make the deck big AF. I'm Okay with it having a 9-10 inch screen, just make it at least 900p, ideally 1800p. And yeah, the cost will probably be twice or thrice that of the steam deck. For series s performance in your hand? Totally worth it xD",SteamDeck

I'd also add that while it has seemed sturdy for me personally it feels even 'cheaper/plasticky' than the switch which 'felt' very cheap next to the vita. 
This is totally fine and it feels light and manageable enough, but it does lack a 'premium feel' . 

That maybe a ridiculous thing to ask for but ironically when I got the switch I knew this device was designed to be used by children compared to the vita that probably was also designed for kids, but it felt like a stylish piece of premium tech (possibly due to size and relative heft), where as if the deck was that hefty, would probably be ergonomically horrible for it's size.",SteamDeck
jh19ou9,"Scrolling through the menus is clunky. Throughout the system.  And Sometimes going from the game to gamepad settings then back to the game can cause my SD to restart.

I agree with a lot of people here about the screen.   I do find turning the brightness up all the way helps.   Using vibrantdeck is a must, IMO.  I actually change the gamma slightly by reducing the green to 80.   Looks much better.

Sometimes I need to exit a game or bring up the settings menu before it'll recognize the connection. And, of course, sometimes it works perfectly.

* No standby downloads

* Screen is pretty bad. Not the resolution, but contrast and colorspace. I shouldn't have to download a plugin to somewhat remedy it. Don't get me started on backlight bleed.

* Software issues galore. Games needing tweaking to work (maybe at all), menus not showing up at the right time, controller inputs changing while in standby, etc.

* The fan is kinda loud.

* Starting MSRP is definitely not $400 and people need to stop acting like it is. At minimum, you're paying for a 256GB or 512GB microSD card to complement the 64GB storage. If you're more inclined, you're buying a used drive off of eBay for $50~$55. Regardless, $450 is more accurate though it seems a lot of people opt for the 256GB or 512GB Decks anyway.

* The community, partially. If you have a problem, you're very likely able to find a solution through some forum or avenue. However, there's just waaaaay too much hugboxxing for any real discussion. r/SteamDeck is particularly guilty of this, with any mention of the negatives being heavily downvoted or swarms of user rushing to the defense about their flawless experiences with the device.

jh1fk0y,"There's been a quirk with the ""new"" fan curve where if the Deck isn't using much power, the fan will randomly ramp up to around 4000RPM for a second, die down for half a minute, and do it again. I vaguely remember reading an article saying Valve were aware of it and should release a fix, because it's such an irritating behaviour. You can get used to a set high fan speed, but constantly ramping up and down is distracting.

The touchscreen is also mega doo doo and in my experience the worst thing about the deck by far. Doesn't matter in 99% of cases, but it would be nice to play games like Little Inferno with touch.",SteamDeck
jh1fk83,"My biggest complaints are:

1. The Steam Dock

This thing has been a huge pain in the butt for me. I have to unplug the charging cable, switch to desktop mode, plug the Deck into the dock, switch to gaming mode, wait for the TV to show the home screen, then plug in the power cable. Sometimes the screen flickers black then back on, sometimes it flickers black then turns green, and sometimes the TV screen just turns black. The latter two I have to re-do all the previous steps. I'm used to the switch where it's literally as simple as ""Drop it in the dock, and you're done.""

Yes, the dock has updated firmware that was supposed to fix the charging cable issue. There's no pending updates and I can't find a way to force it to re-update.

2. Not being able to download while locked/away at work

Would be nice to pick a game to load, let it download overnight or while I'm away at work, then play it. Supposedly desktop mode will still download while the screen is locked, so I'll have to try that out.",SteamDeck
jh1fkyn,"this fucking thing WILL NOT PLAY AUDIO through my receiver. i've trying using the official and 3rd party doc and it just won't. I want it to be as seamless as the switch and now I'm considering shelling out a chunk of dough to get a new receiver I don't otherwise need.

jh1frte,"I wish the on-screen touch mouse worked how remote desktop on iOS works. The mouse has two options, the touch option where the cursor moves where you touch, and another where your finger on the touch screen moves the cursor from it‚Äôs current position and you can see and more accurately click where you need to.

The on-screen keyboard is strange in general. Steam+x to bring it up manually when needed, but why does this sometimes close automatically? Also, I want to turn off the default joystick behavior. This is probably a great method, but for me at least currently it isn‚Äôt helpful.",SteamDeck

-some community improvements should have been already there, like some of  cryo's tweaks

jh1g3yq,"Bluetooth on this thing is fundamentally bad and I do not understand why it doesn't get more coverage. There's inherent bluetooth input lag with every single device that makes using a wireless controller while docked (or anything, really) an absolute pain. If you're the type of person who needs Game Mode to play on a TV, you'll be endlessly frustrated by the input lag. On top of that, all of my devices have a ton of difficulty connecting to the Deck. My keyboard takes multiple tries, all of my controllers take multiple tries, it's an utter pain in the ass.

I have zero clue why they designed the Deck thumbsticks the way they did - they're destined to grind down over time on the edges of the plastic, and my left stick is already showing some pretty serious wear over the course of the past year-ish of using mine.

The fundamental experience of browsing through Steam on the Steam Deck in SteamOS mode, to this day, is *still* filled with inconsistencies and bugs, ranging from sound not working on some screens, to input working in strange ways on other screens. It feels so cheap that the Deck will slow down while scrolling through my library.

For no reason that I can pick up, sometimes my Steam Deck just fails to wake up from sleep the first few times I hit the button, and other times it'll wake up, but only some of the inputs will work for a bit before everything works. Or it'll crash when I wake it up.

Offline mode doesn't track my playtime.

I don't blame Valve for this one - but the sheer number of workarounds that are needed for some games to just work is frustrating. It's so demoralizing to try and play a game only to realize that it just isn't going to cooperate with the Steam Deck for reasons outside your control. Things like the memory leak issue that plagued GTA5 for months or the part where Achievements just weren't working for ME: Legendary for a while, or Ubisoft games performing terribly due to Ubiconnect, and more.",SteamDeck

jh1hfp4,"The keyboard settings in game mode don't work properly. You can change the on-screen keyboard layout, but not the physical keyboard layout, unless you're in desktop mode.

When you have a lot of small patches to download, some of the patches are randomly scheduled, but the scheduled ones are at the bottom of the list. If you try to scroll down to queue them up, when the current download finishes, the list index resets to the top, so you basically can't just queue them all up at once and then let them finish.

The system for finding where your game data is installed vs save data is impenetrable and requires additional apps that give hints as to where they are, instead of making them easy to access at a click.

If you wait too long to update your flatpaks, the Discover app hangs on update unless you disable wifi, reboot, then re-enable wifi. It's the most ridiculous bug.

There are audio issues that happen if you go into sleep mode while a game is running. It gets all crackly and bad.

I dunno if they ever fixed this, but I believe there was a bug where it would treat non-steam apps as steam games, and not let you run one on the steam deck while your PC was playing a steam game. Further, the way it behaves in the situation of waking up your deck while a game is running on your PC is super awful.

This is rough for my use case - I don‚Äôt commute for work or anything since I work from home, so my primary use case is couch gaming controller games on a whim, whereas most other gaming is done at my desktop. Picking it up to use and finding the battery is toast is a pain.

jh3qu78,"To each their own, but personally, that's exactly why I *like* it. I've always preferred d-pads that make it much easier to hit the cardinal directions than the diagonals. My favorite d-pad is the PlayStation design, with its pseudo-separated 4-way focus. And my least favorite is definitely the 360 d-pad, which tried *way* too hard to be a third joystick and ended up being garbage for *everything* (later XBox controllers fixed that to some extent, but it's still too easy to accidentally hit the diagonals, imho).

The Steam Deck's d-pad feels almost as good as the PlayStation ones, probably on-par with classic Nintendo to me, and is honestly a big highlite for the system since I was worried it would be too soft and rockable like a lot of third-party controllers (honestly a lot of them seem to mimic the 360 d-pad's feel for some stupid reason)...",SteamDeck

jh104e6,"OLED panels for gaming handhelds are extremely harder to get right than a TV or monitor though. If a third party OLED replacement ever becomes available, I'd advise waiting for reviews before buying it. 

For instance, the Vita's OLED is quite bad by modern standards, and they had to sacrifice one of the main aspects of OLED (pure blacks) to combat black smearing. Those panels are being used by companies like Anbernic with their 2023 OLED handhelds. Trust me, you don't want to use a 2012 cheap OLED panel in 2023. 

The Switch OLED uses a modern OLED panel, and it doesn't suffer from noticeable black smearing. But to reach the price point, it's using a B grade panel filled with issues *and* instead of an individual calibration step, Nintendo preloads a default curve that only truly matches the display at 50% and 100% brightness, causing a lot of artifacts to appear. Between the issues with the Steam Deck's LCD (light bleed, lower color accuracy, weak contrast) versus the issues with Nintendo's OLED (green subpixel artifacts, uneven white point, brightness curve white point issues) I'd honestly take the Steam Deck's panel every time.",SteamDeck

With the Deck though, I can rest the damn thing on my breasts and give my arms a break even while it's charging. Can game for hours like this.

I could never explain to a casual PC gamer how to do this stuff.

From what I've heard, some publishers are quite uncomfortable with the idea of game retailers like Steam having so much power and control over how their games launch, which has driven companies like Paradox Interactive to develop their own launcher. It just seems to me that the market is incentivizing publishers to have their own launchers and therefore the best outcome for consumers would be for said launchers to exist in a framework where they operate and integrate smoothly alongside retailer launchers.

It used to have pretty bad reviews about its HDMI output, but then I checked again and they were gone. I haven't used it for its HDMI output yet. But it works well for extra USB. I use it with this ancient 100 Mb/s Ethernet dongle I originally bought for my Wii U and it works great for that.

The A port supposedly doesn't support USB hubs, but I haven't tried yet.

The A port can also charge the other device.

JSAUX has a similar device ish but theirs is worse (I think it had only 4k30 or something).",SteamDeck

Farming Sim 22 (Playable) is co-op, you can farm together.

For life sims and harvest-moon-likes my GF and I were enjoying Stardew Valley (Verified) as well as Dinkum (Playable, early access). Traveller's Rest (Verified, early access) is also a fun one, focusing on running a tavern.

2D side-scrolling exploration base-building RPG: Terraria (Verified) is a blast with more than one person, and there's an absolute ton of things to do and reasons to replay over and over again. Get into mods (via tmodloader) and you'll never see the light of day again cuz you'll be too busy playing Terraria! ;)

If you want a Diablo-esque twin-stick co-op shooter, The Ascent (Verified) is a fun cyberpunk romp through a decaying arcology.

Sandbox space exploration: Astroneer (Playable) is a fun builder/explorer. It's really cute and the UI is all in-universe.

Sandbox space exploration: No Man's Sky (Verified) is a labour of love, and a great experience flying with a friend. I don't think you can start together, but after getting to the anomaly you can meet up very easily and explore together after that. Very freeform, so you'd have to work together to plan what you want to do.

Looter shooters: Borderlands series (Playable) are looter shooters, first two games are great but they cashed in and wrecked the story in the third in my opinion. I'd recommend 2, or 3 if you don't give a shit about story.

Fantasy Looter shooter: Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (Verified) way more engaging, plot-wise than BL3. Makes a metric butt-ton of tabletop gaming jokes. Enjoyed it a lot with my girlfriend, ended up both enjoying it far more than BL3.

Classic-ish RPG: Divinity Original Sin 1&2 (Verified) are classic RPGs so if you're fans of any pen-and-paper games you might dig these.

2D side-scrolling colony survival: Kingdom Two Crowns (Verified) and later in the series entries too. They're really atmospheric games that have a good amount of puzzles and secrets to find as you grow your settlement and defend it.

Monster hunting: Monster Hunter Rise (Playable) is a... monster hunting game. You wield big heckin' weapons and fight a huge roster of progressively larger creatures. Expect a lot of variety, from hunting small game to small predators to giant fucking winged, lighting-breathing bastards. Really fun to play as a team of up to 4, difficulty is dynamic so it will adjust to just the two of you.

Racing: Need For Speed: Heat (Playable) needs the EA App, fair warning, but it was fun as hell racing on a team with my girlfriend and showing off our customized cars after winning a bunch of money.

Goose: Untitled Goose Game (Honk! (Verified)) is a game about honking and being a horrible goose. You can be horrible geese *together*.

Recommended to me but haven't played them alone or together yet, but folk seem to like em:
- Wolf Quest (Verified) be a wolf, I guess
- Valheim (Verified) viking survival builder, maybe
- Warhammer Inquisitor Martyr & Prophecy (both Playable)",SteamDeck

jh0xwtc,"Your only option for a usbc dp alt mode capable hub is to spend upwards of $300 and those are too big to mount to the back of the deck with something like deckmate. I've found a single usb4 hub on amazon that has a usbc video out but for some reason it doesnt work with the steam deck and for some reason other small usb4 hubs that are usbc PD powered dont want to provide thunderbolt4/usb4 ports that people can hook to portable usbc monitors.

The options boil down to carrying a large hub that requires a barrel connector for power or using hdmi+usb to usb c on a smaller usbc dock, but those often have issues with delivering enough power.

I'm waiting for a usbc hub that I can mount to the back that also provides a usb4/usbc dp alt out port. Something like the anker 556 with usb4 out. This is why the deck having 2 of its usbc ports that do everything would be super handy.",SteamDeck

jh2nyrg,"Is this not already an implicit requirement? Are there Verified games that still have launchers? 

Even if there isn't an outright ""no launchers"" classification for Verified, the launcher would need to provide a seamless experience, basically run in fullscreen, with controller input, and cleanly exit _before_ the game launches and allow the Deck to transition to the game itself.

At that point if a launcher meets all that criteria, it's probably fine to stay if it provides some functionality that's actually useful.",SteamDeck
jh19sml,"But what if Steam goes bankrupt, pushes certain games off their platform, or makes it more expensive for publishers to use their platform? If a publisher has put all their eggs into the Steam basket, then they are SOL when something bad happens from Steam's end. At least if they have their own launcher, then that's one less thing they have to worry about.

And Steam doesn't just launch a .exe. it can download mods, launch games with mods, and download/launch betas. Not sure if it also does anything as far as multiplayer configurations in the background. It's kind of hard to separate Steam's launching of games from the rest of Steam, but stuff related to mods definitely stands out to me based on what I've seen in other launchers. 

Also the fact that Steam puts all the games in one easily accessible place, so a user doesn't have to depend on the OS for that (in some cases, I've found that Windows doesn't show me my games in the Start menu). I've noticed that launchers often put all the games associated with that launcher in one place, so I don't have to find that .exe file.",SteamDeck

I've tried out a few of these and Steam Deck Tools is probably the most straight forward - you can set it to load on start, each thing is a different component so you don't need to use it all at once - and it's very easy to switch between desktop mode and X360 controller mode.

edit: Adding in that ideally you use borderless fullscreen when you can so you can use the gesture that allows you to switch apps. Easiest way to get into/out of non-Steam games and get to the desktop without relying on setting up controller shortcuts. There's a touch gesture for that in Win 10 and Win 11.",SteamDeck

If you open konsole and paste and run this command:

```bash
du -h -d2 ~ | sort -h
```

It'll output a list of subdirectories that are taking up the most space. You can then replace `~` with the paths of the biggest hogs (_e.g._

```bash
du -h -d2 /home/deck/.var/app/ | sort -h
```

) to continue to drill down.

Of course, that will tell you _where_ the files are, not _what_ they are or how to remove them. But it should at least point you in the right direction.

#### Obligatory explainer 

It's a good rule that you should never paste and run (even non-privileged) commands on any device without understanding what they do, so:

- `du`: disk usage -- it's GNU's disk usage analyzer which reports the amount of space taken up by subdirectories along each given path. The cool thing is that it treats symlinks as files (instead of following them as folders) so you don't end up double- or triple-counting content that's available under multiple paths
- `-h`: make the output human-readible (52.3 GB instead of 54840524) 
- `-dN`: break down to _N_ levels of subdirectories (`-d0` would just tell you the disk usage of the path with no breakdown, FYI) 
- `~`: The UNIX shorthand for your home directly. Equivalent to `/home/deck` but way shorter to type. Provided here as the argument for where `du` is searching
- `|`: ""pipe"" the output from the first command as the input to the second command
- `sort`: what it says on the tin. Sorts the lines of a provided input
- `-h`: Allows `sort` to sort human-readible file sizes (so 12 KB isn't treated as larger than 9 GB)",SteamDeck

If you're using the trackpads for camera movement, use the analog stick instead.

Also, favour performance. to Lower graphical settings until you're getting a steady 60. You may also want to enable VSync if you're experience any jitter/screen tearing. Hope this helps!

I think I‚Äôve actually got one of the burnout games on PS2 already but it‚Äôs a bit of an effort to dig out the console/discs and find a place to set it all up. I‚Äôll definitely try out the PSP game and the GC versions should run well on the Wii U.

Regarding your question on future videos, it‚Äôd be great to see similar compatibility ratings for Zelda, Metal Gear Solid, Metroid, though I appreciate these are a lot more in-depth games that‚Äôll require a lot more play through.",SteamDeck

What I've done is use the Shotty plugin for Decky Loader.  This will take all your screen shots from the insane creepy file structure that Valve decided to use and magically move them all to the **Pictures** folder complete with real names for the folders, making it very easy to see/find them.

For starters, when using Proton, only change it if something breaks, or if a new version of proton has something specific to your game, like a fix. 

When something breaks, like an update, only then try a new version of Proton. It doesn't hurt to just change it first, and see if it fixes. If it doesn't, then try deleting the old Proton prefix, and try again.

Just be wary that some saves and configs are stored in the prefix, so don't delete until you know and then save those files. Use Pcgamingwiki to find out where the saves are.

jh936l7,"Audio crackle and skipping is only there in the recording, audio is perfect while playing all of the actual games. Its caused by some freak interaction of decky-recorder with dosbox. üôÇ 


Setup Tutorial for all of the Dosbox based games:

You can read the setup tutorial for Pandora Directive here, all Dosbox based games (thats all of the games except for Overseer and Tesla Effect) are set up in the same way.:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12iqoeg/issues_with_dosbox_tex_murphy_series/

Setup Tutorial for Overseer:

Tex Murphy: Overseer (4W, FSR 2) 

Finally got it to run.. Minor nightmare.. üôÇ (ProtonDB lists this game as broken.) 
Used Lutris and this Wine version installed into Lutris with Protonup-qt (a fairly recent one with dxvk enabled, edit: lutris-GE-Proton7-43-x86_64). 

CD Version of the game, as the DVD version apparantly doesnt work.
In Lutris click on the plus, add custom game (last entry), Name the game, select the runner (wine), set win32 architecture for the prefix (important), enter the prefix location /home/deck/Games/tex-murphy-overseer  in wine options ticked activate dgvoodoo2 or similar, then ok.

The gag is,that the Game needs to be in a win32 prefix, which with lutris you can only set up at the prefix creation stage. And the default installer detects x64, which is wrong - and then the games installer errors out with win95 or higher error. But if you set win32 at the creation of the prefix (see above, needs to be a custom made one), it gets created in win32 architecture. 
Next, next to play in lutris there is this lollypop icon. Where you can access wine config. In wine config you can set the windows environment to Windows 98 (only available when the prefix was created as win32). then the installer will run. 
From that point forward I didnt run the installer straight away, but followed a cd to dvd tutorial for the game out there (aka nocd) to the T (the one that also tells you to install the 1.04 patch, even created the directories it told me and installed from there). whenever I needed to change the installer, I picked a new exe for the games launch path. In the end I copied over the patched .exe but not the games config .ini yet (nocd tutorial tells you to copy over that file as well, in the end I never did.). Ran the game, then compared the ini settings carefully one by one. (Turns out midi can be left turned on f.e.)

ingame settings double lines on videos, 800x600, and 800x600 windows size, everything in advanced graphics settings checked everything maxed out. 
Mouse cursor flickers. But it isnt a dealbreaker, as you can configure the game to use dual joystick style movement and only need the mouse to interact with things, so you can hide it in the bottom left, when you are not interacting with items, so its only a semi annoyance.

Also the cd to dvd patch works with the german language version of the game as well, although the subtitles then will be english. (Which I prefer. üôÇ ) 

Game crashes pretty frequently every 30 min or so in testing, but then remembers the position prior to crash on your last interaction and starts up very quickly, so I'd say playable. Also I'm not on the latest wine dxvk build, and cxbx also crashed with the one I'm using, so maybe its the wine build. 

edit: Restricting number of cores to 1 in Lutris settings for the game, or moving the installed games location to (fake windows c drive in /home/deck/Games/tex-murphy-overseer/) C:/Overseer/ and not C:/Program Files/Overseer/ (shorter path, no space) may have reduced or solved the frequent crashing issue. Still have to play more to confirm.

With my friends, it's always a challenge getting someone to put up a zip line exactly where we need it, or drilling a tunnel directly to a goal. Bosco does all of that at your command.",SteamDeck
jh3nyp9,"not sure where the term comes from. but it basically is the gameplay mechanic of doing ‚Äúruns‚Äù trying to play through the whole game/section without dying. once you lose you lose all the loot/power ups and restart from the beginning. 

there are a lot of variations of this though. some let you keep certain upgrades and you continue to power up as you progress. 

there are also games referred as ‚Äúrogue-lite‚Äù which is basically a less forgiving version of this. with more checkpoints and things you keep during runs. 

it‚Äôs a really popular gameplay loop currently and it is fun. very challenging but rewarding at the same time. 

great games i love in this genre recently off the top of my head are hades, returnal, rogue legacy, dead cells, slay the spire, spelunky, the binding of isaac, cult of the lamb, and risk of rain.",SteamDeck
jh4b447,"Rogue**like** means a game where if you die you have to start over with nothing. Think of Tetris or Chess or a card game. You have no ""progression"", every match you start with nothing.

Rogue**lite** means a game where you get reset to level 1 after dying, but there is still *some* progression between matches. Usually you unlock permanent upgrades or unlock new weapons between runs, but you still have to restart back at first level everytime you die.

Hades is the latter. You unlock upgrades and new weapons, but if you die on the fourth level you are sent back to the start of level one to start over. Only you have new upgrades now...",SteamDeck

jh3y0pu,"Actually by the strictest definition, ‚Äúroguelike‚Äù refers to games patterned closely after the original Rogue, which uses ASCII style graphics and is turn based. While ‚Äúroguelite‚Äù also stems from that same wheelhouse, but with a much looser implementation that allows for arcadey genres or real time action, and not ASCII graphics.

In practice however, people use the two terms pretty interchangeably.",SteamDeck
jh511j5,"Ohh,  nice explanation. Definitely Roguelite",SteamDeck
jh450iy,"**[Roguelike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)** 
 
 >Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing computer games traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Though Beneath Apple Manor predates it, the 1980 game Rogue, which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator, is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring Rogue's character- or sprite-based graphics.

Valve do not recommend replacing the internal storage, they want you to use the sd card.

>Internal storage on the 64gb model is about as fast as the sd card. 

The eMMC drive can read at about 400MB/s. The microSD is going to be limited to around 90MB/s. It still makes a difference.

>Shader cache is loaded to the RAM when the game loads, slow storage will only make your load time longer, it won't affect the perfomance.

Shaders are shifted in and out of RAM as needed. They do not necessarily persist there indefinitely. Therefore, drive read time still matters a lot.

>Valve do not recommend replacing the internal storage, they want you to use the sd card.

While true that Valve does not support user storage upgrades, they willingly showed everyone how to do it. You're just on you're own if you do. Regardless, it doesn't change the fact that the 64GB model is not viable out of the box, without upgrading the storage.

jhbe2i6,"Buggy ass game, very sorry to hear that. EAC Proton can be buggy too, so here's what I'm thinking you should do.

1. Go to Desktop Mode. Open Steam from it and in the search bar, type in Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime. Make sure this is installed, sometimes it doesn't install correctly with EAC-based games and that causes issues like yours (phantom EAC, where it lets you in then boots.)

2. Delete your prefix for Halo MCC. A prefix is the little bottle your game's settings are stored in and sometimes they don't respond correctly to you adding EAC support. I know for Fall Guys, I had to wipe my prefix before it would recognize the added support. You just have to click start over the game, go to Developer and Delete Proton Files. If this isn't present, go to System Settings and Enable Developer mode.

3. Now, in game properties,go to Compatibility and force the user of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool. Make sure you're using the LATEST Proton-GE. 

If this doesn't work, feel free to message me again.",SteamDeck

What is the ""default"" proton version for the deck? I know I can pick a specific version and use that when I need a proton-ge. But with 8 and experimental in the steam ""store"", how does that work? Do I still pick that? Or does steam just use the latest ""official"" version it has?",SteamDeck
jh6bli3,"Seems like this is what broke a few games that defaulted to Experimental, notably Elden Ring. As others have noted, switching back to an earlier Proton version should help in the meantime.",SteamDeck

Not very into mobile games in general, and I wouldn‚Äôt really bother to play it on my laptop.

But it runs fantastic, and with some custom button assignments it plays much better. As well as having the trackpads available for quick UI nav, or clicking on items in game helps a lot.

*The default assignments for select, back, primary skill etc are weird because they are just mapped in order based on how the mobile controls were. It‚Äôs very awkward unless you change them around.*

I had heard a lot of negativity surrounding it, but it‚Äôs actually a decent game. If you aren‚Äôt terribly susceptible to suggestion and able to resist clicking on every internet ad you see, or rage at what‚Äôs in someone else‚Äôs grocery cart‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fairly easy to straight up ignore the existence of the Mtx/P2W in the game and just enjoy it within the bounds of freeness.

You may still be able to get better performance by tweaking the settings via the config.

According to the wiki, it should be in .local/share/SatelliteReign/

You'll have to do the same thing as above in showing hidden files in Dolphin to see if it's in that folder. Anything that starts with a . is a hidden file.
