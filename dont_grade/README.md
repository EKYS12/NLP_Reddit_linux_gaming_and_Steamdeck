# Not For Project Submission

This file is not for the project submission. My original intent was to do modeling for both Title Data and Comment Data, however, my comment data ended up becoming so big that it was no feasible to be able to model it in time without doing massive data cutting. I still intend to use this data for my portfolio and still have comment EDA done on the EDA notebook. I am keeping this notebook here just to have it around for when I continue to work on this project. The rest of the repo has everything else need for the submission of this project.
